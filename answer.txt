The most obvious way is just to simply benchmark the two against each other. If you have a machine with each processor installed, or one machine with the ability to change the processor, then you can run tests. One machine would be better, to preserve all the other contributing aspects.  Perform some common tasks with each processor installed. These should be tasks that primarily use the CPU, rather than any other component: browsing the web wouldn't be as good, because it primarily uses the network card (yes, it does use CPU, but I don't see that as its primary resource). Tasks such as these:   Rendering, such as image editors, or in games; Heavy calculations. If you can program, make yourself a loop with some heavy work in there.     If you don't want to do as much work, you can look up processor stats. A quick Google search revealed this website, among others, to me, which seems to me to hold lists of processors that someone else has benchmarked for you.
The newly (August 2015) announced Motorola X Pure Edition costs $400, well below your price range, yet is a high-end modern smartphone. I think European branding is Moto X Style.   5.7" 1440p Quad HD display and front-facing stereo speakers (515 pixels per inch - better than Retina). 21 MP camera 3GB RAM microSD card (up to 128)   This phone matches and frequently exceeds 100% of your requirements.  Since this is as close as you get to raw Android short of a Nexus device, rootability is almost guaranteed so local hotspot should also be doable.  Also, as I noted, virtually every recent Android phone that's recent fits all your requirements, except from two 2015 Samsungs (Note5 and S6 have no SD card) and some late 2015 ultra high end flagships that edge higher than your $600 budget. If you include 2013/14 models that are now cheaper, you'll probably be happy with any of a couple dozen models.
Well, based on your preferences, I would definitely recommend OnePlus 2. One of my friends bought it, and it's really awesome with the best features and at a reasonable price.   13 MP with dual flash and of course laser-focused 4 GB LPDDR4 RAM Adreno 430 GPU Octacore CPU, good for gaming   Comes at â‚¬ 399. The only exception is you need to Buy with an invite. People can't just walk to the store and get one, so to buy/place an order, someone must send you an invite.  Who is that someone? - usually, the OnePlus team will send an invite to a few people and they can pass the stick to others, and this continues. To get a better understanding of the invite, visit the link Invite System.
General guidance for buying cameras alone can be applied here. There are several important aspects:   Pixels This is the resolution that the image sensor is capable of capturing. The greater the number, the more detail you'll get in your image. This does, however, combine with the next point: Sensor size The bigger the sensor, the bigger the pixels can be. And the bigger the pixels, the better your image quality. 'Nuff said. Zoom type Only one part of zoom, this. Look at optical vs. digital zoom - in short, optical zoom uses lenses to make the image look closer to the sensor, whereas digital simply scales up the image. Optical results in better quality because the image size stays the same, but it's generally bulky because of the need for a moving lens. Digital on the other hand scales everything up, losing detail and resolution and also making noise more apparent. Most phones use digital simply because they don't have room to include a zoom lens in their cameras. Zoom range This is the number like that comes in the format "8x digital zoom" or "32x optical zoom". The bigger the number, the further away you can sense things from. Take care, though - big digital zooms often result in pixelated images. With a phone, you can often simply get closer to your subject - an 8x is often adequate.
The Nokia N9 (64GB version) goes for under â‚¬600. The exact price will vary depending on where you get it, I'm not a price expert. It's a bit of a niche phone since it has an uncommon operating system (MeeGo, a Linux distribution).   3.9" AMOLED 16M display (251 dpi) 1 GHz Cortex A8 8 MP, 3264 x 2448 pixels, Carl Zeiss optics, autofocus, dual LED flash   For the rest of the specs, see the link. The screen is slightly smaller than requested, but it's not that big of a difference. I think it's definitely a noteworthy candidate.  Amazon currently lists 2 new ones between $400 and $500.
Look at Xiaomi (world's 4th largest smartphone maker) for reasonably priced phones with good specifications , they are often hard to beat price-wise.  E.g. the Xiaomi Redmi 2 Pro Smartphone meet all your required specifications and costs ~130 USD: 4G LTE, 2GB RAM, 16GB memory, MSM8916 64bit Quad Core 1.2GHz, Android 4.4, 4.7 inch HD OGS Screen, Dual Cameras. (all specs)  Check out this list of popular Xiaomi phones for a wider choice.
QNAP TS-231  I've been using a TS-212 just about 24/7 for two years. I was happy enough with it that I recently bought a second QNAP device, albeit one that has 4 drive bays (TS-451). It appears that the TS-212 has been phased out in favor of the TS-231, but the specifications appear to be very similar. I think it will meet your requirements.   Put two or more hard drives on RAID 1.   There are two hot-swappable drive bays, both RAID 0 and 1 are supported  As cheap as possible.   It's currently available for $179.00 on Amazon. Admittedly, it's not the cheapest dual bay NAS available, Synology's DS214se is currently $149.00.  Allow to install software to manage NAS from cloud.   The NAS comes with QNAP's custom web interface. That includes myQNAPcloud Connect which "helps you access the published services of the Turbo NAS quickly and securely on the Internet."  Energy efficient   Power consumption is listed at 9.78W in standby, 20.56W in operation  Reliable, in the sense that this will be probably running 24/7.   As I already mentioned, mine has run 24/7 for two years without disruptions. The only time it goes down is when I lose power, and I can always rely on it to boot back up and launch the services I have configured.  Allows to be accessed as a media server.   There are a few options here. The "QNAP Ecosystem" has apps; there are many media server utilities available. I just use it as a file server to connect from Windows machines, that works well enough for me needs when accessing media.  Option for data encryption.   Supported, but I have never used it so I cannot speak personally to that.    Potential Disadvantages   The RAM is soldered and not upgradeable. Other QNAP models allow you to upgrade the RAM, but you're stuck with 512MB for this one. It's an ARM processor. The OS is a custom QNAP flavor of Linux so it's easily customizable if you need to do something beyond the user friendly web UI, but any custom utilities you install need to support ARM processors.
There are essentially two options:   A USB hub with power control, such as this one, which was designed for this purpose. It seems like some other USB hubs can do this too, check this question over at StackOverflow for specifics and possibly other methods of doing this. DIY, with a USB-controlled relay to switch the power to the usb device on and off, see this blog post for an illustration of how someone did it. Maybe fix the problem with your usb device ?
Blueproducts has a great product line, I guarantee they will have a design you like. There are so many to choose from so I won't go into much detail here.  I personally have the Blu Studio 5.0C which is a bit older now but when I bought it brand new a year ago, for $125 plus shipping, it exceeded all expectations.    Android (4.4) 5.0 inches 720 x 1280 pixels 294 ppi 8 megapixel camera (rear) 2 megapixel camera (front) Quad core, 1300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A7 1024 MB RAM / 4096 MB ROM 2000 mAh battery Dual sim card GSM 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz UMTS 850, 1700/2100, 1900 MHz HSDPA+ (4G) 21.1 Mbit/s, EDGE, GPRS
I recently got a Wacom Intuos Pen Small, and I love it.  It does everything I need it to do and it skips out on all the extra buttons and features that probably aren't needed anyway.  The price tag comes in at about $80.  The size of the area that you can draw in is about 6"x4" inches. The actual size is about 8"x7" It might seem a bit small, but it's really plenty.  It comes with 1024 levels of presure sensitivity. I know some of the more expensive models have more, but this is enough for my purposes.  It also has four buttons at the top for Ctrl, Alt, Shift and the Windows Key. Each of which can be customized.
Broadly-speaking, it would be silly to consider anything other than a digital desk at this point. That said, there will be a learning curve for people that are used to analog desks.  I've been operating a Yamaha LS9-32 at church for the past four years or so, and have found it to be an excellent board.  Now, for your requirements:     We have a fairly flexible budget, but system under $10k would be best.   Ours was purchased four years ago for ~$8500 US. I'm not certain, but logic says that it would be cheaper than that now.     We'd really need to have at least 10 aux sends, plus stereo mains   output.   It has 16 aux sends in addition to the stereo mains.     We'd like to have more inputs, but we've gotten along fine with 32.   This is a want, not a need.   The LS9-32 has 32 faders and 32 inputs on-board, and you can add an additional 32 inputs via an external digital input module if needed. The additional 32 channels are accessible on the desk by switching from the "1-32 Layer" to the "33-64 Layer".     It shouldn't be any bigger physically than our GL2200, otherwise we   have to start moving things around in the booth and we don't want to   do that.   The LS9-32 is roughly 35"x20". I wasn't able to find the specs of the GL2200 to compare size.  In addition to the above, here are a few high-level features that I enjoy:   Each channel has a 4-band, fully-sweepable parametric EQ, and two dynamics "slots" The channel dynamics slots can be used for compressors, gates, limiters, de-essers, etc. The LS9 has on-board effects "racks", with a wide variety of reverbs, delays, choruses, etc. On-board recorder, with inputs you can assign arbitrarily to discrete channels, auxes, or mains Motorized faders along with a generous scene memory "Guest mode" - with this, nearly all of the board's features are either unavailable or locked. Prevents guests or new users from doing something stupid The Yamaha "StageMix" iPad app. This is huge. It's a free app that connects to your board via Wifi. Nearly all of the functionality of the board is available through the app. This lets me do things like be on-stage during sound check to listen and adjust monitor mixes. Also, I can roam the floor, on-axis with the PA and hear the actual mix instead of having to guess from the sound loft.   Our sound staff is exclusively non-pro volunteers (including myself), and while there was a bit of an adjustment period, all of them were able to pick up the basics fairly quickly, and have been expanding their usage and knowledge of the board each time they're on the schedule.
No question: Get a Wacom Intuous.  Available for under $100, this will provide all the key features serious graphic artists and photographers use in Photoshop, Illustrator, and the like: high resolution pressure sensitivity, touch sensitivity.  It has a large enough surface that you might never feel the need to upgrade.  And you may even find it to be a useful replacement for your mouse in more traditional applications.
If you are planning to use it mainly for FPS gaming, and you are competitive in it, you are going to want to have a monitor that is 60hz - 144hz with a low response time <5ms.  The 60hz - 144hz is your refresh rate and it won't matter what graphics card you have if you have a monitor that is only running at 30hz.    If you're not on the competitive side then here are the different questions to answer to help you decide on what you want.   What resolution? (1080p, 1440p, 4k) What refresh rate? (60hz, 144hz) What type of panel? (IPS, TN) What size screen? (You have already answered this in your question but still something to think about) What aspect ratio? (16:9, 21:9, etc.)  What size of a bezel? (You mentioned this as well saying you want a thin border) Price?   A site that I use to check some of these is pcpartpicker.com. You will be able to filter on all of these things directly from their site.
Water-cooling is better than traditional fan-cooling. Using it is reasonable if you have hardware that gets hot very often and reaches its temperature limits; and you can't cool it down in traditional ways. Another (bad) reason is something like "hey people look, I have watercooling because its cool". And the last reason is - it's not noisy and dusty.   And what about performance? Hardware may slow down on high temperatures. That includes CPU, GPU. Hardware can get damaged on high temperatures. For example, HDD (yes, it's max temperatures are usually about 55-60C, whereas CPU can be 70-100C), especially HDD on notebooks.  There is no performance gain when using watercooling. But there can be performance loss or damage if such temperature-sensitive devices don't get enough cooling. And then watercooling is a good option to re-gain the lost performance.
Look at Xiaomi (world's 4th largest smartphone maker) for reasonably priced phones with good specifications , they are often hard to beat price-wise.  E.g. the Xiaomi Redmi 2 Pro Smartphone meet all your required specifications and costs ~130 USD: 4G LTE, 2GB RAM, 16GB memory, MSM8916 64bit Quad Core 1.2GHz, Android 4.4, 4.7 inch HD OGS Screen, Dual Cameras. (all specs)  Check out this list of popular Xiaomi phones for a wider choice, some are slightly cheaper (e.g. Xiaomi Redmi 2A A at 102 USD).
There are many many more options if you build your own system, and you can then be more flexible in terms of the components and the machine that you end up with.  For example: are you looking to max out the graphics card? do you want to be able to upgrade said card relatively easily in a year?   The other piece of advice is to not get too hung up on definitions.  The HTPC cases are going to be more like what you are looking for in terms of looks and are perfectly capable of being gaming rigs.  Take a look at the Silverstone cases as an example, and this one in particular for a fit in a living room:    You might think that one is too big, after all it fits a standard ATX case, in which case you can check out the slim models etc.  However, more space makes it easier to cool quietly and it looks just like an amp you might see as part of a normal home theater set up.    Silverstone are not the only game in town either, Streacom, Origen AE, Lian Li, Fractal Design have some amazing looking cases and more mainstream players like Corsair (the Bulldog is coming soon as of writing this) have options on the way.  In terms of pre-built systems places like QuietPC have been offering excellent (and quiet, of course) options that would certainly fit in your living room.  As to whether to stack your components, I would always recommend an air gap and no direct contact - even though the heat will generally exhaust out the back a lot of the small form factor units are going to radiate heat from the case directly.    I have cooked a wireless router while sitting on top of a PC and had overheating problems with an Apple TV for similar reasons.  If you must stack, then always try to have the hottest component at the top.
The Moto E is a low end cell phone priced at ~$120 USD for the 3G model (off contract). It has 1GB RAM, 8GB internal storage, supports up to 32GB microSD, and Android 5.0. The display is 4.5" qHD 540x960 245 ppi IPS. The 3G model has a 1.2GHz quad-core CPU (Snapdragon 200) and an Adreno 302 GPU (400 MHz).  Also, if you order it from Motorola directly, you get free shipping.
What is hyper-threading and how does it work? does a good job at explaining what hyper-threading is:     Hyper-threading is where your processor pretends to have 2 physical   processor cores, yet only has 1 and some extra junk.      The point of hyperthreading is that many times when you are executing   code in the processor, there are parts of the processor that is idle.   By including an extra set of CPU registers, the processor can act like   it has two cores and thus use all parts of the processor in parallel.   When the 2 cores both need to use one component of the processor, then   one core ends up waiting of course. This is why it can not replace   dual-core and such processors.   This article presents a benchmark on the benefits of hyper-threading:       As the performance boost figure of only up to 30% indicates, Hyper-Threading is not the same as doubling the number of cores on a processor.    Another benchmark can be found here:            Wikipedia has a section on hyper-threading's performance. Basically the results aren't clear-cut.  So all in all, it is probably useful if you plan to have more threads running than the number of physical cores, which is likely to be the case, but the performance gains won't be miraculous though and in some cases null.
What exactly is hyper-threading?    This is a process where your processor simulates another processor core, allowing better multithreading/etc.  For example, a dual core machine with hyperthreading will have:   2 physical cores 4 virtual cores   In some sense, this allows the processor to "pretend" to have more cores.     When should I buy a processor that utilizes this?   This can be useful if you are doing applications that are heavily multi-threaded. Virtual machines, image/video processing, compiling code, etc. Basically if your computer use is going to be heavily CPU dependent.  For most users hyperthreading will have minimal effect.
There are some more options (added to JonasCZ's answer):   KVM - generally a good option to control servers remotely.  Raspberry Pi or Arduino (etc) - easy and cheap. In case of Raspberry Pi you can connect it to the necessary ports, connect to the net and that's it. They also have pins which are easily programmable.
I am using a Raspberry Pi for this purpose (not really web hosting, but I used it just for testing, and it works fine). It's a pretty good solution, because you can make more out of it than just a NAS with web server if you want.  For your purpose I would recommend the Raspberry Pi 2 since it has better performance and probably should handle your amount of users easily.  Also keep in mind, that your website's performance is affected by your connection speed (up and download), and you need some basic Linux skills for setting it up.  There are also other barebones systems that could be good, but I don't have experience with them.
I already offered a NAS recommendation as a response to this question, and I'd maintain the same recommendation for your situation.  QNAP and other commercial NAS devices are just small Linux machines with custom operating systems to make configuration and management consumer friendly. By default, QNAP devices are set up as web servers. The administration and configuration can all be handled through the device's web UI. The low cost models (such as the TS-231) would be quickly be bogged down by a high traffic dynamically served website, but for something simple the performance should be suitable.  The stipulation is that you may not get the latest and greatest server software available as an easy to install package. For example, here's what "apps" I can currently install listed under "Developer Tools":    Note the versions for these services are behind the current stable branch. If you absolutely need the latest, you might have success installing it manually via SSH. If you desire something a little less DIY, there are also easy installation options provided for many popular CMSs.
Just pick up a cheap prepaid/no-contract Android phone like the LG Optimus Exceed 2 or Moto E.  The Exceed 2 frequently goes on sale for as little as $15-$20 and has a dual-core CPU and 4 GB flash.  The Moto E often goes on sale for $40 and has a quad-core CPU and 8 GB flash. I bought one for $10 on Black Friday 2015. The camera is garbage but otherwise it is a good low-end Android phone for development.  There are also other prepaid phones that run older versions of Android, as well as older unlocked models available on the secondhand market (e.g., eBay) for well under $100.  Keep in mind that, while many people do have high-end phones, many others have lower-end phones, and it's useful to test an app on a range of hardware.
There are more parameters when comparing and choosing CPUs. Also lets not forget that performance depends on what we do. Lets bring list of parameters which can affect performance (sorted by importance, high to low).  Performance:   CPU frequency - how many GHz. The most important parameter. The more, the better. Core/Thread count - (another very important parameter) how many actual cores you have, and how many threads the cores have. For example,  i7 may have 4 cores and 8 threads, whereas Core 2 Duo has only 2 cores and 2 threads. That means you can run 8 (better 4) concurrent program threads on i7, compared to 2 on Core 2 Duo, which results in better  multitasking/multithreading.  This is the main reason why i7 2.4GHz is more powerful than a 2.5/3GHz Core 2 Duo. IPC - instructions per clock cycle. Another important perameter. Like GHz, the greater, the better. This measurement can often be hard to find, but is very important when comparing processors of the same frequency. (by Firepower0701) Bits - 32-bit, 64-bit. A high-performance application created for 64-bit  CPU may have better performance than 32-bit performance. Also it can limit maximal amount of RAM (depends on OS). For example, old Windows XP could see 4GB RAM when CPU was 32-bit. Today most CPUs are 64-bit and usually you will not feel RAM limit (unless you are running a powerful server). Cache - a very fast but little memory placed near to CPU. Usually improves performance (if we omit cache-miss, but that's another theme)   Other options to compare:   Support of hardware - RAM type/size/frequency, for example, DDR4 2133MHz, 64GB. Another important parameter can be PCI (Express) version and number of lanes (e.g. for connecting SSDs). The higher, the better.  Power consumption, TDP - watts consumed by CPU and produced heat. This is important especially for mobile devices, tablets and notebooks which have battery and don't have good cooling systems. Does not affect performance. Built-in graphics - newer CPUs usually have better graphics than old ones and support more monitors. Of course that's not enough to run new high-performance games but is good for home/office usage and low-end gaming. But built-in graphics is not so important when you already have graphics card. Other features - features like HyperThreading, Turbo Boost, VTx. Some of them may have good impact on performance, others may be useful for specific cases. Most of them don't increase performance on daily usage.     Anyway, you can use benchmarks to test CPUs, or see benchmark results in sites like FutureMark, PassMark CPU Benchmark, or use benchmarks such as Cadalyst for AutoCAD to determine performance of one software. (This is a better way if you don't know much about hardware.)    Note: There are lots of other parameters. If some very important parameter is missing here, feel free to edit and add (by placing low-importance parameter in lower place, higher in higher).
There several differences between each cable. Display port supports 4k at high fps. HDMI can do 4k but only at 30 fps. The one benefit of using HDMI is that it can carry audio when VGA and DVI do not. DVI in single link can only do 1080p when in dual link can carry a higher resolution. There are several other differences also which you can read about here.If you are looking for a format for connecting your monitor go with DVI if working with 1080p but if you are using 4k you will want to use display port.
Your best option would be to use the upliftdesk which is available online and has a motor to make it go up and down is made with quality materials has wire managment and it has a keyboard tray. It is $630 though. upliftdesk also has a frame only desk that is just a frame and has a motor already on it for $460 but it does not have a top so you would have to get one yourself.
Logitech's wireless mice with Unifying Receivers all have smooth-scrolling middle mouse buttons as far as I know.  This listing of all Unifying devices out right now has some good alternatives for you. The M510 is one of the more robust, larger mice they make. Possibly the closest you'll get to the late M505 (RIP) is the M325 which is almost the same size and has the same features aside from being newer. Based on what you described, I think these would be your best bets.
I'll start with VGA, which is, in my opinion, a "standard".  VGA is an analog signal. This basically means that the quality will not be as great as cables that make use of digital signals, especially at high resolutions. The problem with analog is that noise often distorts the signal and the quality ends up not being as good. So in terms of quality, go for the other three.  Digital signals do not have this problem because they are noise tolerant.  DVI is a digital signal that has a few different connecter types and two link modes:      DVI-A has an analog signal. DVI-D has only a digital signal. DVI-I has both, making it especially useful as it can be used with VGA-DVI adaptors   Most adaptors are single link and support a resolution up to 1920x1200 whereas dual link supports up to 2560x1600.  HDMI is the standard for HDTVs. It is also a digital signal and is therefore fully compatible with DVI-D and DVI-I. The benifit of HDMI over DVI is that is has the ability to carry audio as well as the video signal although it does require that your monitor has built in speakers. Recently, HDMI 2.0 was released and gives HDMI the ability to better deal with 4K (Ultra HD) displays at a higher frequency and FPS. If your display or TV has HDMI 1.4, youâ€™ll be limited to 3,820Ã—2160, 4K, at 30 Hz. However, if youâ€™ve got a video card and 4K display with HDMI 2.0, youâ€™ll be able to get 4K at 60 Hz.  There's not much difference between between HDMI 1.4 and DVI besides the audio in the HDMI, which can be a real benefit depending on your setup and that colour ranges for HDMI go beyond the RGB spectrum which DVI is limited to. The only benefit of the DVI is the physical screws that support the DVI cable and help prevent port damage.  DisplayPort is the newest of the lot and is aimed towards higher end monitors - newer and high-end monitors tend to have DisplayPort. Its designed to deal with 4K at higher FPS and Hz. DisplayPort is capable of 3840Ã—2160, 8K at 60Hz or 4k at 120Hz!  DisplayPort looks like it's the way of the future, especially if you want 4K.  Generally it depends on your setup (monitor and graphics card), what you can and can't use but for the future of gaming DisplayPort looks the way to go.

There are a few more factors than the ones you listed that will really play a part in how much you'll have to pay. One being the panel type and two being the input type(s).   IPS panels (the screens that feel like glass) cost more but have a better viewing angle, more vivid colors, and they're usually a little more sturdy. TN panels (the screens that make weird colors if you press on them) cost less and are more common but are usually faster in terms of response time. Thus, I'm thinking you could use an IPS if there's a good price. Monitors aren't really ever made to specifically be a primary or secondary monitor &mdash; they're all the same in that sense. So that's out of the question. Portability is very subjective. One person might think a monitor is portable while another might not. Personally, I judge portability by the box the monitor comes in. For example, my Asus VE358 comes in a box that can be used as a big briefcase. Other manufacturers might not do this. As for input types, you just need to know what inputs your laptop has. DisplayPort and HDMI will cost more than VGA because they carry audio as well as video.     So, on to picking some monitors out. I have one that is on the high end of your budget and a few on the low end.   Dell P2014H &ndash; $150, 19.5", IPS panel, average resolution Dell E1914H &ndash; $100, 18.5", TN panel, small resolution Dell E2014H &ndash; $110, 20", TN panel, average resolution   In terms of sturdiness, I lean towards Dell because they use a stronger plastic for most of their mid-tier monitors as opposed to something like Asus where the plastic is a little bendable.
The Asus MB168B+ looks like it would fit your needs. It:   is designed as a second monitor with a USB 3.0 cable to power it, and transfer video and data (also works on USB 2.0, but you may experience worse results video quality-wise) has a 15.6" screen with 1920x1080 resolution is very portable, weighing less than 2 pounds, and being about as thin as a pencil (0.3 inches); it also comes with a case for protection and also to act as a stand can cost under $150; prices range from about $140 to $225, depending on where you buy it (bargain stores are cheaper); if cost is your biggest issue, you may want to check out the Asus MB168B (no "+"), which is very similar except that it has lower resolution (1366x768) and overall lower quality display; it can typically be found under $150 at well known stores   If you prefer higher quality display over cost, the MB168B+ is the better fit, but if you really need it to be under $150, you'll probably want to go with the MB168B.
As long as you aren't trying to run a hair dryer off of it, this adapter should do the trick. It isn't grounded, which means it I would not expect it to do very intensive work, and some plugs may require you to fill the grounding peg hole to get a current. You should have some sense of supervision if you plan on drawing any more power from it. Though this adapter does have its problems, but it is quite lightweight and will get the job done for your purposes (and your 3ds).  Yet another answer is to use a 5V USB charger to charge your 3ds, and that will do a fairly good job without the need for a converter.  You can also just get a 220V 3ds charger/adapter, as they are very cheap.
Ergotron Workfit-D    Image source: ergotron.com  I do not (yet) own this desk, but I've put lots of research into this in hopes of soon owning a sit-stand desk. After evaluating quite a few desks, I've all but settled on the Workfit-D. It is non-motorized; the raising and lowering is enabled by Ergotron's "Patented Constant Forceâ„¢ technology". That's a fancy term for "spring powered". The height adjustment is done by squeezing the handbrake on the front right corner of the desk then lifting.  Relevant Specifications   Capacity â€” 65 lbs (29.5 kg) Surface area â€” Rectangular, 47.6" x 23.5" (121 cm x 60 cm)   If you'd like custom dimensions, Ergotron sells just the base. The maximum recommended dimensions are available on that product page. Note the difference in capacity; presumably the surface shipped with the Workfit-D is 23 lbs. IKEA sells many different table tops in different sizes, shapes, and colors; you could go this route if you'd like some customization.  Vertical lift â€” 20" (51 cm) Minimum height â€” 30.6" (78 cm) Maximum height â€” 50.6" (129 cm) Price â€” Currently $689.00 with free shipping on Amazon   Advantages  I initially was drawn to IKEA's Bekant motorized sit/stand desk due to the lower price, but two things dissuaded me: speed and stability. I've seen multiple reviewers report that at higher heights the Bekant is not quite as stable as you might expect. The Bekant also has a very slow height adjustment. Ergotron produced this video comparing their desk's rate of adjustment with one that is motorized. The video is a little silly but does a good job making a point.   Disadvantages  The Workfit-D does not have infinite height points. It uses locking pins to secure the desk at the height you select. I don't have information on the spacing between the pin holes but personally I would be happy with what's available based on the video reviews I've watched.  The minimum desk height is also a little high. My current static height sitting desk is roughly 28". I think I'd be comfortable with the 30.6" height, but it's a surprisingly high base for desk that has an adjustable height.

From Wikipedia:     The advantages of using water cooling over air cooling include water's higher specific heat capacity, density, and thermal conductivity. This allows water to transmit heat over greater distances with much less volumetric flow and reduced temperature difference.      For cooling CPU cores in computing equipment, the primary advantage of water cooling is that its tremendously increased ability to transport heat away from source to a secondary cooling surface allows for large, more optimally designed radiators rather than small, inefficient fins mounted directly on the heat source.   So basically it can be beneficial when some of computer components get too hot (overclocking, warm room, etc.), as it is more efficient than  air coolers.  As for noise, see this nice benchmark:     With fans on low speed, liquid coolers are not able to stay as silent as the quietest state-of-the-art air coolers. Some air coolers can maintain 25 dB(A) or less at a 10 centimeter distance, while the most silent water cooler (Corsair H55) creates 31 dB of noise. Only three liquid coolers stay below 35 dB(A) which is virtually inaudible: the H55, the Antec H20 920 (the original version!) and the Corsair H60. The Corsair H100i and H80i don't go below 40 dB(A), which isn't that loud but also not very quiet.
I would think entry level servers with RAID, Hot swap and if needed with redundant Powersupply would be sufficient for this. Any of the entry level servers with Dell, HP and IBM should fit the bill. To keep budget low, SATA as opposed to SAS hard drives (keep in mind the reduced RPMs) and built-in SATA RAID can help
Basically you have 2 options:   Hand-held 3D scanners (cost at least $300): Sense 3D scanner, Structure.io, Go!SCAN, Fuel3D. Should work out-of-the-box. USB depth sensors (difficult to find < $100). These have a few limitations:   All don't come with an SDK that creates high quality polygon models from 3D pointcloud. You'll end up coding. Do not contain an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) like , so models may be mis-aligned. (this is just a guess) Not wireless    What you are asking hasn't hit the market yet. I'd definitely invest some more money and choose option #1.
If you're just coding and avoiding RSI, get a keyboard with scissor switches. This switch type is used in the famous ultra-thin Apple keyboard and most modern laptops. It's extremely quiet so you won't get annoyed, and its key feature is its low profile meaning you don't have to press keys down "really far."  With a mechanical keyboard, most switch types need the user to press 3-4&nbsp;mm (from initial to actuation point), which doesn't seem like much at all, but after a ton of key presses it adds up quickly. Scissor switches reduce this distance to just 1-2&nbsp;mm.  You definitely want a keyboard with scissor switches if you're just coding.
The GW 2050IP seems to be a great buy. $112 and decreased price for bulk buys.   1080p @ 2.0MP/30FPS (3.0MP/17FPS) &mdash; if you're willing to take a blow to FPS, 3-5 megapixels would do a lot of good. Built for outdoor and indoor use 42Pcs infrared LEDs for illumination (up to 130ft) Optical zoom of 2.8-12mm &mdash; the downside here is that as focal length changes, focus changes with it   This model also includes remote connection via a mobile app and noise reduction among other nifty features.
Use the emulator that comes with the Android development kit.   Cost: $0.  The only point of testing with a physical device is if you want to check the compatibility and ergonomy of your application with a physical device: how it makes use of non-ubiquitous peripherals such as a fingerprint reader, how it interacts with manufacturer-specific software, etc. This is useful if you test with hundreds of different devices. Testing with one cheap device won't teach you anything.  The emulator gives you more possibilities than any single phones. For example, you can (and are encouraged to) test with multiple screen resolutions.
It will be hard to find a stereo camera for < 100USD. Still, you can have a look on Microsoft Kinect and Asus Xtion PRO LIVE.  There is no such stereo camera with a wireless video transmission in the market however you can make one using IEEE 802.11 transmission bands.
In my experience (new mechanical user):  Advantages   Key Rollover - Mechanical keyboards should support NKRO (infinite simultaneous key presses) over PS/2 and 6KRO (six simultaneous key presses not including four modifiers like Ctrl, etc., so 10 simultaneous) over USB*. Being able to press this many keys means the only limit to your typing speed is your fingers, not the keyboard. Repair/Customisation - Keycaps are easy to remove so you can move them around (mine is Colemak. I've also heard good things about Workman). Also this means replacing keys and cleaning are a lot easier than on many non-mechanicals. Build quality - As a premium product the build quality and reliability is very high. As an example the standard Cherry MX switches can withstand 50 million key presses compared to 5-10 from rubber dome keys. Feel - There is something nice about the key presses of a mechanical keyboard   *Specifically a limitation of the USB protocol. This may be manufacturer specific, but I'm not sure. If anyone knows, comment below!  Aesthetics  For many people the aesthetics are important. If you spend a lot of money on something you often want it too look good. With my keyboard free custom keycaps and printing were included so mine looks like this:    Disadvantages  Cost is significantly higher than a normal keyboard (mine was US$200 approximately).
I personally ordered the OnePlus Two, but to be honest I would go for the ASUS Zenfone 2 (version: ZE551ML, that's important!) if you can live with some bloatware (not that much) because:   It costs 300-350â‚¬/211-255Â£ and it's sold on Amazon. It has 4 GB RAM. That's plenty of RAM for gaming The processor (Intel Atom Z3580) is quad-core clocked at 2.3&nbsp;GHz and it seems to have no/less heating issues than the Snapdragon 810 (e.g. used in the OnePlus 2) It's a 5.5" phone with a 1080p/Full-HD resolution, so it fits in your pocket and offers 401ppi It has a 13&nbsp;MP rear camera (with dual-tone flash, autofocus, HDR) and a 5MP front facing camera and both do their job; compare it here: http://www.gsmarena.com/piccmp.php3?idType=1&idPhone1=6917&idPhone2=7247&idPhone3=6902). But it can only record videos in 1080p @ 30&nbsp;fps According to Gsmarena it can create hotspots It can be ordered with 16/32/64&nbsp;GB internal storage and you can add up to an extra 64&nbsp;GB with a microSD card It has a 3000 mAh battery combined with the fact that it's no QHD resolution it should should be plenty of battery life, so you'll most likely get through the day without recharging. Some nice extras are FM radio with RDS, fast charging (60% in 40&nbsp;mins according to Asus) and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for the protection Runs Android 5.0 (Lollipop) with Asus ZenUi on top (some bloatware preinstalled but not much, and I think you'll be able to uninstall most of it) Supports many carriers, but you should check at http://www.willmyphonework.net/ if it supports your carrier. I'll assume you come from the UK so the global/international version will most likely be the one that works Full specification sheet: http://www.gsmarena.com/asus_zenfone_2_ze551ml-6917.php     Summary: So a great phone for a low price tag, and you can buy it quick and easy unlocked on Amazon. Some more expensive phones maybe offer a fingerprint scanner or QHD or wireless charging, but they are not on your criteria list and are just some extras that sometimes even come with a disadvantage (e.g. QHD-> higher resolution, but it drains more battery and needs a better GPU then a FullHD screen for the same gaming power)    Some other phones that you can look at too are the OnePlus Two and the upcoming Nexus 5x. Some will suggest the Moto X Style/Pure because it can be compared to the OP2 or Zenfone 2 specification-wise and cost around the same as the OP2 (both around 400â‚¬) in the US, but in Germany (most likely in the UK too) the Moto X Style/Pure costs around 600â‚¬ and the lower specificatied Moto X Play costs 400â‚¬ here. So I would neither recommend any of the Moto X phones nor the OnePlus 2 because it's hard to get (invite system), has some problems and nobody knows when they'll release updates for it and also no NFC if you need that.  And just one general thing: Watch/read a few reviews by yourself before buying the phone you want, because they include some more information that might be interesting or deal breaking, but aren't mentioned here!
The problem with those kinds of USB devices is that it's very difficult to know what chip they are actually using. Some devices in the same series might even use different components if the manufacturer was able to source a slightly different component at a cheaper price. They would then ship a Windows driver that supports the different variations of hardware components.  It may be possible to glean something about the used chips by looking at the Windows or Mac drivers. What you would be looking for are strings that you could match against existing Linux drivers.  However, before going through that trouble, you could do the following:   See if the manufacturer or seller has some mention of Linux compatibility, either in the available documentation, marketing material, or online forums. Search online for any of the marketing terms for the device to see if anyone else has already tried using it with Linux. Search in one of the Linux driver databases. There are several available (and some list other OSes as well), such as http://www.linux-drivers.org/, https://wiki.debian.org/Hardware, https://h-node.org/, and https://www.linuxquestions.org/hcl/.   In general, if the manufacturer doesn't declare Linux support for the device, chances are it won't work very well even if there are Linux drivers. Then again, even devices with declared Linux support don't always work well or might not support all of the device's functionality. Ultimately, there are no guarantees and the only way to know for sure is to try. I've had some luck with shops that would allow me to bring a laptop and try the device in the store before deciding to buy or not. (In those cases I've mostly found that the USB device didn't work at all or was practically unusable.)
Security   Can the router be configured such that future configuration changes can only be made from the LAN and not from the WAN? Is the router protected from XSS/XSRF attacks which could let websites visited by computers on your LAN get control over the router? Does the vendor provide firmware security updates, and are they easy to install? Is it also easy to downgrade to a previous firmware version?   IPv4 NAT  I guess more than 99% of users currently need NAT for IPv4 traffic, you can expect pretty much all routers to support this, but the quality varies.   How many connection tracking entries can the router handle? What happens when the limit is exceeded? Can the router be configured to forward ports from WAN to LAN? Can the router be configured to forward protocols without port numbers from WAN to LAN? Can the DHCP server on the router be configured with both static and dynamic assignments? Can the DHCP server on the router  be configured to be hand out DNS server addresses of your own choice?   IPv6  Current trends indicate that the majority of users will be using IPv6 three years from now. If you intend to use the router for more than three years, you are likely going to need IPv6.   Does the router support it at all? Can the router be configured over IPv6? (This is not critical, but it can be very convenient). Can the router be configured with static IPv6 on the WAN? Can the router be configured to act as DHCPv6 client on the WAN? Can the DHCPv6 client request a prefix delegation from the ISP? Can the router forward packets in hardware? (If not, the CPU may become a bottleneck)   Wireless   Can it be configured with dual SSID? Can it be configured with a guest segment which cannot communicate with wired LAN ports? Can it measure ambient noise level across the frequency band and automatically choose the channel with least noise?   Keep in mind that if reliably low latency and low packet loss is needed, WiFi will never beat a wired connection.
First, you should figure out what your actual power consumption is. A 600W PSU only draws 600W if the hardware needs it. You can get a Kill-A-Watt or similar monitor in the $15 USD range. You can also get a decent ballpark number from online calculators 1, 2, 3. Don't forget to include your monitor.  The UPS you linked only supplies 300W. It gives 10 minutes as the backup time, and I'm going to have to assume that's at full (300W) power draw, as I don't see any other stats on the battery. So, no, it probably won't fit your needs.  You could take a look at the APC or CyberPower UPS selectors to get an idea of what would fit your needs and the price range.
If a GPU says it can do 4k, that is a minimum requirement for a desktop environment. If however you're going to be doing 4k video/photo editing, you'll want to look at recommended GPU specs for the software you'll be using.  GPU memory and clock speed are the next main concerns. If you're software is mainly CPU intensive, most 4k GPU's will be good enough.
32-64 GB of RAM definitely. Probably get a chipset that goes up to 64GB but get 32GB first leaving extra slots available to upgrade. VM RAM can fluctuate and is largely based on what your doing with it and how much you need to give it. I can run 3-4 VM's which I deem to be fairly average VM's + about 40-60 chrome tabs off of 32GB no problem. There's usually about 8GB free once everything loaded up and since background CPU usage is often pretty low, I can game on it while all this is open.  You'll also want to get a beastly CPU - more cores, higher clock, the better. A specific chipset isn't that relevant - newer costs more but often has performance & efficiency gains. Do what works for you and your budget.
Definitely doable. Often you cannot port the landline directly to a VoIP or Google Voice number but you can port it to a temporary cell phone and then to a Google Voice number.  https://www.google.com/voice  It's $20 if you want to keep the number but if you want to just get a new number, that is free.  You can use the Hangouts + Hangouts Dialer / Google Voice apps to get the calls received on your smart phone(s).  Something like http://www.magicjack.com/index.html would be another approach to keeping the landline but being able to forward calls.
It should also be noted that along with GPU memory and clock speed (see Enigma's answer) that the GPU should also post what version of port the card uses.  The two most popular are HDMI/DVI and Display Port. Most 4k screens only accept HDMI (no DVI) and Display port (example), research what is supported on the model you plan to buy. Most sub-4k monitors support VGA (old), DVI, HDMI and Display Port however not all at once depending on the quality of the screen.  Quick reference:   HDMI 1.4 supports 4k at only 30Hz (currently the most popular) (ref) HDMI 2.0 supports 4k at 60Hz (ref) HDMI 2.1 supports 4k at 120Hz (ref as of Dec 2017)  Display Port 1.2 /w Multi-Stream Transport(MST) supports 4k at 60Hz (currently the most popular) (ref, ref) Display Port 1.3 / 1.4 supports 4k at 120Hz (ref)   Currently on the nVidia side most of the 600/700 series that have a display port plug support 4k but in my experience will struggle with it if there is a lot of dynamic content.    For the sake of this answer 4k is referencing 3840 by 2160, however it can mean other resolutions check here. Also use of an adapter will not grant the full potential Hz of a port see here.
I have had this need myself (though not to cover an acre) and I eventually got tired of the horrendously poor capabilities offered by ISP devices.  Now, rather than using the WiFi settings of those devices, I turn WiFi off completely on the ISP device and use a separate router.  Once you have configured your own router to your liking, it is completely plug & play because it is completely independent of the ISP router.  I have kept the same set up through fibre, cable, DSL and even a move to a different country.  I started with the venerable Linksys WRT-54G (that will show you how long ago this was - I loved that router), and that meant that I discovered the fantastic DD-WRT firmware.    Since then, DD-WRT compatibility has been my number one requirement when upgrading to the latest tech.  First, I went for the Linksys WRT-600N, added a Buffalo N600 as an extender (which comes with DD-WRT as stock firmware) and now use a Netgear Nighthawk R7000 as my primary router with the older Linksys as my range extender.  That's worth noting: you don't have to specifically buy an extender, any router with decent firmware can be configured to function as an extender while still giving you the option to use it as an AP later.  In terms of actual recommendations, the aforementioned Nighthawk is pricey but has been excellent for me so far. It has plenty of horsepower, USB 3.0 support and more.  Netgear also has a range extender model that I have not used personally but have heard good things about from friends.    Plus, I personally think it looks cool :)    To cover larger areas, you can also replace the antennae on many routers (Nighthawk included) with larger, extendable, high gain antennae so that you can mount them away from the router and get far better coverage. If you are on a budget I once used a colander as a make-shift directional antenna to better enable line of sight connectivity to another router.  One other note: if you have a router with separately configurable 2.4 and 5Ghz interfaces then you can restrict the lower range, lower speed legacy devices (b, g) to the 2.4Ghz spectrum only and take full advantage of the 5Ghz goodness and better range offered by N and AC on the more modern devices.  Again, this is something I have done very successfully with DD-WRT on the Linksys and the Netgear models - I have one network with a -g postfix using the 2.4 network (actually N in mixed mode) and one with -n (which is AC, N only), both with the same password.
If you have an Android it's very simple, you don't need any apps or external devices. Just go into the call settings, and scroll all the way down. There are the Internet call settings, where you can directly log in to your VoIP provider and answer calls wherever you have an internet connection (make sure to check the Receive incoming calls check box). I use this solution to connect to my router, to use the landline it (the router) is connected to, and it works fine.
The general list of features you should consider has been pretty well covered by others, I will tackle this from a slightly different angle:  Just how important is the camera to you?  Is it more or less important than the phone features, or the phone OS for example? There are options that prioritize the camera over the phone, like the Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom.  It is more of a camera that happens to be a phone than a phone that comes with a camera.  The zoom gives you 10x optical zoom and a friend of mine that attended conferences a lot and blogged absolutely loved it.  Personally, I found it a little too bulky and I would prioritize other things.  If budget is no concern, but you don't want a dedicated camera, you can have your normal phone camera for most things, and then get a QX100 or similar (QX Series) from Sony that gives you a Carl Zeiss lens and separate sensor independent from your phone.  Then you get clever attempts to make digital zoom not suck, like the Lumia 1020, which gives you a 2.7x zoom equivalent at 5 megapixels.  For that though, you have to be OK with Windows OS versus Android or iOS.  Finally, I am loathe to point you at something that is not available at the time of writing (but it is expected within the next month or so), but the Asus Zenfone Zoom seems like it may hit a sweetspot - 3x optical zoom, still slim, Image Stabilisation support, Android OS, and more.
As an alternative to a separate voltage converter (which for such a small device is probably overkill), although the 3DS states 4.6V as an input voltage, it will accept 5V.  Hence, you can simply buy a USB charger cable (like this one) and then you can use your laptop, desktop, or any of the myriad USB wall/car chargers that you can pick up cheaply (or like many, already have from your phone/tablet) that will work with 110/220V.
It depends heavily on what you're looking for in the drive; SSDs are faster but ultimately less reliable.  SSDs work using electronic circuits and NAND (or NOR) gates to store data. Traditional HDDs use magnetic platters. This grants SSDs faster performance, since they don't have to spin up the platter and seek to the disk location requested by the OS.  However, if you're looking for long-term reliability, HDDs win out. As I explain in this answer, HDDs are less prone to accidental damage and data loss - if you drop it while it's processing, there's a risk you'll lose data, but if it's idle then the head is secure.  For an Xbox (or any gaming console, for that matter), I recommend using an SSD. You don't really need long-term storage (the next console'll come out soon enough), and the SSD will provide much quicker save/load times, which is desirable.  The major disadvantage of an SSD is the price, but (IMO) the quicker responses they give you makes it a worthwhile investment.
The AvertX 30X HD provides pretty much everything you're looking for, but it only covers ~105m. This brand tends to not specify optical or digital zoom on their website which makes things difficult. The 3S N5012 has a lot of very appealing features. Specifically, 94mm max focal length paired with 12x digital zoom can provide long view distances. This could reach close to 500m, but digital zoom severely affects video quality, so that's your call.   I'll update this as I find more options.
SSDs, at least for the moment, are very expensive for the mass storage of games, and only really decrease load times on levels. In this sense, an SSD is not a valid option for a game console at the present.  However, SSDs have some very nice things about them-    They are more reliable than Hard Drives, as they have no moving parts They provide over 100% of the data transfer speeds offered by hard drives, though due to the (kinda terrible) CPU of a console you may not get the full benefit of these transfer speeds. Due to the fact that they are much more reliable, they are much more useful for RAID arrays.   Honestly, at the present moment, you should just go for an HDD for the console.  The best 2.5 inch hard drive for the money at the moment is this one. For ~$100 you get a decent performing 2tb HDD.  An external 2.5 or 3.5 inch hard drive like this one will also serve your needs for a little bit less.
CODE keyboards are, indeed, some of the best I've found.  I run the CODE 104 MX Blue, and I've loved it.   It doesn't slip (rubberized feet, and good weight). $145 (incidentally, all the CODE keyboards are well within your budget) Nice and clicky like a mechanical should be - but the "hail on a tin roof" is dampened so you don't get constant rattling (use MX Brown caps if you want completely dampened clicks) There's a version of it without a numpad It does have the Windows key not a command key - but you can disable the Windows logo key or swap it to function as a command key Backlit (adjustable and toggleable) You can toggle between QWERTY, Dvorak, and a couple of other layouts   I use it with a Windows laptop, so I can't guarantee it works on a Mac - but I'd imagine it does. Also, it comes by default as wired USB - this is convertible to a PS/2 connection, but I don't believe it's Bluetooth-enabled.
I have been using this keyboard for several years (I bought two, one for home and one for work): Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard.   It works fine with my Macbook pros (I have used 2010 and 2015 with it) as well as Windows.  There are pads which don't slip (rubber feet) $70 or so on Amazon currently US/QWERTY setup, with no numberpad (which adds a huge amount of ergo experience, you save a lot of arm movement when you use your mouse) It's clicklet key, which means it is pretty quiet (similar to my Macbook Pros) No number pad attached (it has a detached one, which is nice the few times you need one) Has a single small usb receiver (just 1 for both numberpad/keyboard) Batteries last quite some time in the keyboard, the numberpad is less so but I never use it so I don't bother replacing   When I have looked in the past few years it is the only non-wired, ergonomic keyboard without a number pad.  The only disadvantage is it's usb.
I have looked for other HDD that fit your requirements, and the one you linked to in your comments is the best that I have found. Its capacity is 2TB, it is a standard size, so it will fit inside your PS4, and everywhere I have looked, people have stated that it is a reliable drive.   The downside to this drive is its speed. White it uses the SATA 6.0 Gbps interface, I doubt you will see that in your use. Ideally, you would want the RPM to be around 7200, but since this is such a high density drive, you should see the same, if not better, performance than the stock HDD that came with your console.
I've had good luck with Seagate Barracuda drives. You can get a 1TB bare drive for $50 on Amazon, or go all the way up to 5TB:    Note that there are reports that Barracuda drives could be unreliable. In that case, take whatever hard drive (or SSD) brand you like (some are better than others in general).  Now, get yourself an external drive mount. I've been using a Thermaltake BLACX N0028USU ($40, but a cheaper one should be just fine):    It'll take both 2.5" and 3.5" drives, and it's really nice on its own to have around - you can take a hard drive out of a dead computer and use it to get the data off the drive, for example. It's also nice and heavy and doesn't float around your desk.  With this combination in mind, your requirements:     Very reliable (obviously, it's a backup); close to 0% failure rate.   Well... 0%? Probably not. But mine hasn't broken yet...     Should last for at least 5 years.   I've had mine for 6.     Not too expensive. Cheaper is better, and the absolute maximum for me is probably somewhere in the ~$100 range.   You're in that range, and now you have the initial investment in the mount out of the way - hard drives to put in it are only going to get cheaper.     1TB of storage space at minimum. (Of course, more can't hurt, but this doesn't matter as much as the other factors above.)   Check.     Should be usable with my laptop (so ideally, over USB).   That BlacX one has a USB connection on it, can't speak for others (although USB is fairly universal)  The main ding against this setup is that it isn't terribly portable, although I've taken it on vacations before wrapped in clothes (the hard drives come with an ESD-resistant case, use it!) with no ill effects.
For super portable backups, I always recommend a Western Digital Passport. They come in a few different capacities and colors and you can choose an optional "grip" to make it quieter when it's laying on a hard surface.    The one little setback with these is they are entirely USB-powered, which is great, but that means transfers won't be as fast as an external HDD with its own power source.  Still though, the Passport is very, very small and light. A fantastic buy for large backups with portability in mind.
Ballparking from your backup plan (12 GB working set, weekly backups, retention of three months), and assuming full backups rather than incremental backups, you need about 150 GB of storage, rather than the 1 TB you specify.  At this scale, you're looking for an external USB hard drive or solid-state drive.  None of these is exceptionally reliable (five-year failure rates vary between 1% and 100%, depending on brand, batch, and luck), so standard practice is to use two of them.  For protection against bad batches, I'd recommend getting different brands for your two drives.  I'm not recommending any particular brand, simply because predicting which ones are reliable or not is a fool's errand.  Avoid drives with special "one-touch backup" or similar features (they're just another possible point of failure).  Select two ordinary drives based on whatever minor criteria are important to you, such as color, physical size, presence (or absence) of an external power cord, etc.
Whether the firmware has been compromised is a valid concern â€”Â it happens (it's been done for show, and it's rather rare but it has been found in the wild).  But a bigger concern is whether the firmware has been programmed correctly. Many SSD firmwares don't implement secure erase properly. Should you trust them to implement crypto properly? I haven't seen a reliable study on the topic, but I've heard (private rumors in some security communities) that some â€œself-encrypting drivesâ€ are actually mere password-protected drives, with no encryption if you just bypass the controller. As a consumer, there's absolutely no way to know whether a particular device does it rightÂ¹.  The upshot is that I wouldn't rely on the encryption capabilities of a storage device.  There's not much point in doing encryption on the drive itself rather than in the CPU anyway. This isn't the 1990s, most CPUs have plenty of spare cycles, of which encryption will only cost a little. Major operating systems come with native encryption: Bitlocker under Windows, dm-crypt under Linux, etc. If you have one of the cheaper editions of Windows that don't have full-disk encryption, or if you need an encrypted removable drive that's portable between operating systems, use one of the TrueCrypt successors.  Â¹  Finding a way to attack a particular model can have a cost in the $10kâ€“100k range, so it's not something you can do casually â€”Â but once the attack is found, carrying it out on a particular drive has an incremental cost that can be in the $10â€“100 range, or <$1 if it's a pure software attack on a buggy firmware.
Don't bother with a power converter unless you have a lot of appliances that need 220Vâ†’110V conversion. The Nintendo charger is itself a converter from 220V or 110V depending on the model, to the 4.6V used by the console. Chaining converters wastes energy, in addition to requiring two devices when one will do.  In my country, you can get a 220V 3DS charger for about $5 (example). Or, for about the same price, you can get a USB cable that lets you charge the console from any USB power supply, so you can combine that cable with any USB charger or PC that you have lying around.
You need a relay, probably driven by USB. Examples: Yocto-PowerRelay, Cleware USB switch, EnerGenie EG-PM2 (found by a web search, I'm not endorsing these particular products or vendors).  Lots of people use a Raspberry Pi or similar boards to control mains-powered appliances, so you'll find lots of discussions around this topic in their communities. You can build something cheaper if you do some of it yourself, but don't do that unless you're comfortable working with mains power â€”Â you could fry your hardware or worse, fry yourself. If you already have a RPi or Arduino in your system, you can get specialized peripherals for a bit cheaper, e.g. SainSmart 8-KanÃ¤le RelaisModul or PowerSwitch Tail for Arduino (and see this thread on Arduino SE), Pi-Face Digital for RPi (and see these threads on Raspberry Pi.SE), etc. There's quite a bit of material around on using the PowerSwitch Tail with either Arduino or Raspberry Pi.  Whatever product you use, take care not to exceed its maximum amperage.
Kasperd's answer is good, but there are some other critical things to look for:  Reliability Many routers have software that is so poor that it crashes, sometimes as often as every few days. Some routers are made poorly and the hardware fails after a few months or a year.    Compatibility Some routers have compatibility issues with some devices.    Either of these can make your nice new router useless.
When I researched digitizers Wacom was the clear solution.  I think they have a patent on their unpowered pen that gives them industry dominance.  You should get a Wacom Intuos Pen & Touch Tablet.  To stay in your budget you would have to go with the Small, model #CTH480, which runs ~$80 and provides a 6.0"x3.7" active area on an 8.25"x6.9" tablet.  Next step up is the Medium, model #CTH680, which runs ~$180 and provides an 8.5"x5.3" active area on a 10.75"x8.75" tablet.  Both sizes come with a pen with eraser and 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity.  Wireless connection for either requires an extra $40 accessory kit (model #ACK40401).  If you're tracing you probably do need to pony up for the Medium size.  But I do graphic design with the Small and even though it sounds like a tiny working area the resolution is so high that I don't have any trouble working on an HD monitor.
It's safe to say that upgrading to 12 GB's would be enough, but if you really want to be sure, take the 16 GB's step.  Personally I use 6-7, sometimes 8. I have 16 GB's and can say it was money well spent.
Sure it would. Since you're running multiple processes and your main goal is to multitask better, it would really improve performance and smoothness.  For what you're currently using, 12 GB should suffice but it seems you're limiting yourself because of your 8 GB of ram so go ahead and get 16 GB.  Also if you're using Linux it would be better to set your swapness down to zero. If you're using Windows you can have a look on how to control your ram and swap usage. That way you can benefit more from your ram.
but I still want more desktop space   Having worked extensively with virtual reality, I will say without any reservation -  this really isn't a good idea.     Is there a head-tracking VR headset (either augmented reality or such that a keyboard can still be seen/used while wearing) that could be used as a 360-degree (or even 180 degree) monitor?    Note these are commonly called HMDs and you might have luck further researching these.  A few significant drawbacks with this idea:   Pixel density for reading text is poor. The Occulus Rift released next year has a resolution of 1080x1200 (per eye, so effectively that resolution). For most people wanting more than 4 monitors (!) this is going to be infuriatingly small, as you will basically only be able to view a 1080x1200 area at any given time. Design purposes are different. Virtual reality hardware is nearly exclusively designed to render/create 3D environments (ie gaming) - not 2D. This is primarily a problem because most are still designed to do this, not be "monitor extensions." The ergonomics of this would be awful, since you would be rotating your head constantly. If you don't believe this, hold your head at an 45 degree angle for 5 minutes, it will not feel great.    ... if it feels ok, add a roughly 1/2 pound (or more) weight on your forehead and repeat. VR HMDs are heavy, which matters more if you use it every day like you intend.  Eye strain. Put your face ~1 inch from a computer monitor for an hour (or eight). You know how people talk about taking breaks from a normal computer monitor at several feet away? Imagine ~1 inch for that time... Windows managers/interaction. This is a hard problem and not a "productionized and solved" problem yet. Is it ok if you can't see your mouse/keyboard? Probably.  Tracking system. If all that's not bad enough, you need some sort of additional system to identify the orientation of your head, in order to feed data back into your computer, in order to tell the graphics engine what to draw (or what your viewport is if you prefer). This is important because if you are using hardware you likely have to use their custom software - this is incredibly non-trivial to get to work the way you want, in many cases. So if you are going "outside" the designed purpose it is very non trivial (especially since you likely need some sort of specific window manager).   Some more specifics of your questions:     Is it wireless?   Using the Oculus Rift, which can be hacked to do what you describe, it has a total resolution of 1080x1200 for each eye, or 2160x1200. Refresh rate is very important for this sort of thing though, slow refresh rates are very disorienting when your entire world is at a say 5 FPS rate.   To have wireless you are basically streaming better-than-HD video at a veryhigh framerate (probably 20 FPS or higher) or it's incredibly disorienting, especially if/when you move your head and the screen doesn't update immediately. Laggy/slow updates will make you sick or frustrated quickly.     What kind of virtual resolution would I end up with?   If you are willing to write your own windows manager/etc you can probably have whatever virtual resolution you want. This route would not be for the faint of heart :)     still want more desktop space   My last point is about this again.  If you want to use VR/AR for something like this you need to determine whether your primary problems with "only" 4 monitors is visible space (at any given time) or limited tiled space (ie positioning windows on top, in different areas). If you are ok with limiting your visible resolution significantly, for a greater ability to layout windows, then VR/AR in its current form is really not your best bet (given the above disadvantages).  There are also higher resolution HMDs available than the Oculus Rift. But the Oculus Rift has a much larger community of people exploring this idea than other technologies.  My recommendation would overwhelmingly be to get higher resolution monitors and/or more of them if you are looking for an actual, day to day, use case. The VR/HMD route is probably fun and interesting but at this point I highly doubt you would find it useful or beneficial for day to day work.
I recommend: the Sennheiser Momentum In-Ear phones.  They have/are:   Excellent sound quality With a frequency response of 15-22k Hz, you'll get the full range of sound. The mids are a little less powerful than in some other headphones, but not by any majorly noticeable amount. Very reliable Flat cable A flat cable, being flat, is less likely to get twisted in the sense that a cylindrical wire would. It's also a decently strong cable to boot. Reasonable price tag They're around Â£65 ($100) which, while a noticeable amount of money, is worth it. They provide excellent quality and reliability for their price bracket. Comfortable A microphone attached
I would recommend the Roccat Syva earbuds. They have flat cable, good sound & bass, reliable (have them for over 2 years). Also as a side node, they look very cool.  There are some things needed to specify about them:   They have a microphone on the cable (which is pretty good, won't tangle, won't break) They have a TRRS 3.5 mm jack (that means common jack for microphone and sound) There is NO sound control on the cable They do not come with a special case to protect them   The price is about $30-$40. Money well spent I would say.  And to answer your other questions:   Even having the specs on the box, they don't help as much, knowing the impedance and frequency... I study electronics, and still make no sense to me as how they affect the sound quality. It depends how they are built and with what components. This "headphone hunt" is more as you said... Trial and error, recommendations, testing etc.   I wish you all the best in your search.
If you can use an external drive, there's the Toshiba 3TB Canvio HDTB330EK3CA (catchy!) It's 3TB and 2.5 inch, but it's expensive. Expensive to the extent that you could get 2 2TB drives for less than the 3TB. If it's just space and size you're looking at, this could suffice - otherwise, perhaps not.  If it's an internal drive you want, Toshiba also have the MQ03ABB300, which is a 2.5 inch 3TB drive for internal use. Again, it's got the storage and the size, but it carries a premium price.  My recommendation? Wait until these are cheaper. Meanwhile, get yourself a 3.5 inch drive, or 2 2.5 inch drives.
Like the CODE keyboard, I will recommend the WASD Keyboards 87-key mechanical keyboard. The base cost is $145 USD, but it can get up to $185. Let's look at your requirements one by one.  Requirements:   Must play nice with my 2012 MacBook Pro   This uses a standard USB connector with no special drivers. This will work with your MacBook.   Must not slide around too easily, that's my pet peeve with keyboards   It weighs 2 pounds and has rubber feet on the bottom to prevent it from moving around. Even with the plastic feet up at the back to tilt the keyboard, it won't move around on its own.   Must be affordable (ideally < $200, but much less would be better)   Depending on your choices, which I will get to at the bottom, this keyboard will run anywhere from $140-185 USD. It is a more expensive keyboard, but you do get what you pay for.   Format should be US/QWERTY. Bonus points if I can rip the keycaps off and turn it onto Dvorak, if I ever get the ambition up to do so.   Since this is a mechanical keyboard, you can pop off the keys if you wish. However, the keys are only the same if they are on the same row. When you order, you get the opportunity to customize the key-caps. You can have both the QWERTY lettering and Dvorak lettering on the same keyboard.  There are hardware switches on the keyboard that allow you to switch the layout from QWERTY to Dvorak. You just have to unplug the keyboard to do it (more about this below).  Ideally:   Bluetooth, I don't have very many spare USB ports   This does not come with Bluetooth. You are going to have to use a USB port.   Have an option to have an OS X-style 'command' key symbol instead of the nasty Windows key symbol.   They offer the Windows, Mac, and Linux symbols for the keyboards.   Not sound like hail hitting a tin roof, that makes me cringe when I type.   There are quieter switches available for this keyboard. Stay away from the green and blue switches. If you need help picking switches for your keyboard, check out Jeff Atwood's answer on Super&nbsp;User.  Not needed:   Numeric pad: I hate those things and never use them anyway   This keyboard does not have a numeric pad.   Portability: I don't have any issues using my MacBook keyboard when traveling.   This keyboard could be taken with you, but it might be best to leave it at home.  Other Pros:   Hardware switches (on the underside of the keyboard) allow you to further customize your keyboard. Check out their documentation to see exactly what they can do. You can choose how this keyboard will look and feel by changing the key-caps (the colors and lettering for each key), the type of switch, and add in O-rings to reduce noise from the keyboard. O-rings are like tiny rubber bands that go on the bottom of each key to reduce the noise of the key-cap bottoming out (known as the "clack"). O-rings cost $15 and $10 extra to have them install them for you. The USB cable is removable. It is a standard USB-A to USB-micro cable. You can completely change out the keys if you ever grow tired of the way it looks.   Other Cons:   Some Cherry MX switches are more expensive than the others. Browns add $5 to the cost, Reds add $10, and Clears and Green add $15. Unlike the CODE Keyboard, this is not back-lit. This can make it more difficult to type on in the dark. The keyboard and the key-caps are quite thick. From the bottom of the keyboard to the top of the first row keys is about one inch. This can take some time to get used to if you are coming from a thin or laptop keyboard.
The Samson Meteorite is pretty good, for its price.   Very limited hiss at all. In fact, at high levels, you're more likely to get the environmental noise recorded than any hiss. It's a USB mic, so it should work with your laptop with minimal setup (requires driver installation, as do most peripherals) It's a condenser mic, which is good for voice recordings. It's unidirectional, so will only pick up stuff from the direction you point it at. It's just under Â£30, which is around $45 if I recall correctly - a little over your suggested price, but not massively.
I recommend the Syma X5C.   Integrated 720p HD camera Slow controls (won't shoot off into the distance the instant you touch the sticks - this makes it easy to fly) Extreme manoeuvrability. It's an aerobatic drone, so you're sorted there. I can find one new on Amazon for Â£30 ($46) Camera records to SD card, so you can download the footage later.   A word of warning, which I said in a comment and will repeat here: don't expect other drones to be similar. There may well be some similarities between the odd few drone models - but control weights and sensitivities are always going to be different, no matter if they're tunable or not. A 1kg drone will respond faster to control input than a 10kg drone; that's just physics. When getting a new drone, always take some low-flying time in a relatively safe location so that you can get used to the new control feel.
I was able to find a Neewer NW-700 ($27) condenser mic that comes with a shock mount and XLR-to-3.5mm cable. I've read that this will most likely require external power because the 3.5mm connection won't do by itself. However, if you're getting into podcasting, you'll want to look into an audio interface and things like that.  An alternative to this is a Tonor ($16) consender mic. This one is smaller and cheaper, but its 3.5mm input will be all you need. It comes with a tiny tripod which is great because condenser mics can be a pain to mount.  Both of these mics provide great quality for their price and will be useful for your needs.
Raspberry Pi  On the hardware side, there's an HDMI port; you can connect a monitor up to 1920x1200 (possibly through an HDMI-DVI or HDMI-VGA adapter, which costs barely more than an HDMI cable). There are 4 USB2 ports. The Ethernet port is 100Mbit/s, which should be plenty sufficient for a thin client, especially if it's displaying a web page rather than doing X11 over Ethernet. Wifi isn't built in; if you need that you'll need to get a USB wifi adapter. There's also a pair of sound jacks in case you need to plug in a microphone and loudspeakers.  The small form factor and low power consumption (far less than anything you could get with an Intel processor) make it appropriate for environments with dicey power. There's no battery, though you can purchase one separately.  The one downside I see is that the only form of storage is an SD card, which can be removed in an untimely manner. You may want to hold it in place with sticky tape or something.  There's only 1GB of RAM, not 2GB, but that's enough to display a few web pages.  The Pi has an ARM CPU. That means Windows is out (except a special version of Windows 10, but most Windows software won't run on it since most vendors distribute only x86 binaries), but almost all Linux software will work.  Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't officially support ARM but there's an unofficial image. If you prefer a distribution that's officially mantained, you can get Debian jessie (there's also Raspbian, but it's optimized for the Raspberry Pi 1, not version 2 which is what you should get now that it's out). Ubuntu is based on Debian and pretty much all the system administration will be the same. Debian doesn't ship Ubuntu's Unity interface, thoughÂ¹.  Both Firefox and Chromium (not Chrome) run on the Pi. There are also more lightweight browsers; try them with your web pages and see if they support all the features you need.  The reference price for the RPi2 is $35, to which you'll need to add a bunch of accessories (USB power supply, keyboard, mouse, monitor, cables, USB wifi adapter if needed).  There are other similar ARM-based boards that may be more adapted to your needs, for example if 2GB RAM is a strong requirement, or if you really want Gigabit Ethernet, or if you need wifi, etc. The reason I'm putting the Pi forward is that it's the one with the most literature and support out there.  Â¹  This may be a relief.
I recommend using a SanDisk MicroSD card. They're probably one of the most popular options, and for a good reason, too. They're very reliable, and not too expensive (Especially the 64GB one; The 128GB is newer technology, so it'll cost more per GB). I've used mine for years, and never had any problems with them.  It might be tempting to buy a really cheap one from a brand/company nobody ever heard of, but I don't recommend purchasing storage devices from untrusted/unknown companies, because, in my experience, they tend to cause lots of problems, most often being data loss.
There are several great brands that make Micro SD cards, including, but not limited to   SanDisk Lexar Samsung PNY Kingston   I read here that Samsung and SanDisk tend to make the best micro SD cards in terms of performance, but the difference is not much to look into.  Realistically, they will all serve you well, so if you do find a really good deal on a MicroSD card, just go for it. A link to the Amazon Page for MicroSD cards is here. Just make sure you look at the reviews.
I recommend the ASUS RT-AC66U. It's been rated by SmallNetBuilder to handle 835Mbps download:    This is one of the higher through puts I've seen personally.  Additionally, it has:   Up to 450Mbps wireless speeds on 802.11n Up to 1300Mbps wireless speeds on 802.11ac Concurrent dual band transmissions so you can get up to 450+1300 for a total of 1.65Gbps wirelessly if you utilize both the 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz frequencies Up to 6 guest networks (3 on the 2.4Ghz band and 3 on the 5Ghz band); Each guest network can be configured to have internet access during certain times, require different passwords from one another, allow/deny access to the internal network 4 gigabit ethernet ports 2 USB ports  Parental controls Supported by dd-wrt in case you aren't happy with the stock firmware   Personally, I also am very fond of the administration interface. It is "pretty" to look at and doesn't scare a new user, but allows users that know what they are doing the ability to do so.   Disclaimer: I am a happy owner of this model router. I do not have gigabit internet, however I have installed two such routers in small businesses that do have gigabit internet. Both businesses have mentioned they are happy with their internet service
The Quirky PPVG-WH01 Pivot Power Genius is network controllable.  There are mobile device apps for controlling it.  If I remember correctly it's based on Electric Imp so it should be easy to write your own apps to control it.  It's < $65.  Also check out the Ankuoo Neo, YW Smart Plug, KanKun Smart Plug, and Broadlink Smart plug.  All are < $30.
I'm going to divide water cooling into two categories: Closed loop and Open loop. Now we can compare Tower (air), CLC, Open loop and exotic (LN2 or similar) cooling methods.  Big air coolers are generally around the $50-80 mark and produce decent performance for the 50-150W CPUs that you see in everyday life. Pretty heavy, and mounted on the motherboard, in small cases, these are not options. Smaller ones are cheaper, but they cool far worse.  CLCs are generally designed for CPU cooling only. The small radiator ones (120/140 mm) do not offer an improvement over air cooling. The big ones (240/280/360 mm) are advantageous for high TDP (above 200 W) or big overclocks.   Another advantage is that the big, heavy metal block is mounted on the case instead of the motherboard, which reduces the stress on the motherboard, and you don't have to remove the cooler when shipping it.  CLCs are not customizable, and good units cost about $80 - 100, around $20 more than your high end air cooler. They are also a fair bit noisier, because of the pump. Finally, there are sometimes issues with VRM overheating, because of the reduced airflow near the VRM.  Open loops are more of the same, but you can add GPUs and your Motherboard to the list of things that can be cooled by the loop. You can have far larger or more radiators, add dye to your cooler, etc, etc. Unfortunately, open loops are also more vulnerable to leakage, because they're not sealed. Good open loops cost around the $200 mark, though you can get hybrid systems that start out as ordinary, but unsealed CLCs that you can eventually modify.  Exotic systems are only used when you want to push your hardware to the limit. Often, this means below ambient cooling, where the temperature is below air temperature in the local area. Beware of the condensation. LN2 systems are some of the more popular ones. I'm not sure exactly how much these cost, but be prepared to pay more than $400. If you want to have 4 GPUs and one 8 core CPU all in the same system and push the clock to double the stock frequency, this cooling is for you.
Your requirement &ndash; to be able to read license plates at 500 meters &ndash; is pushing the outer limits of commercial technology.  You are talking about a camera that will cost thousands of dollars, and may be a custom-built item.  Therefore, you will have to contact higher-end camera manufacturers directly to discuss whether existing products meet your requirements, or what they would charge to build one.  Alternatively, you may be able to hack one together using a "tethered" higher-end consumer digital camera and lens with waterproof housing. But that's still going to cost 4-figures per camera.
Programming   Neither GPU has any impact here.     Editing raster graphics   It depends somewhat on what sort of editing (and how large the graphics are), but most editing can be handled adequately by a modern CPU.  Note that GPU-accelerated editing is generally only present in high-end software; if you're using something like Paint.Net or GIMP, you probably won't see any benefit.     Occasional gaming (not necessarily new games)   Neither GPU is suitable for gaming.  The optimizations that make the Quadro line good for rendering or CAD also greatly impairs their gaming performance.  Expect performance comparable to the slowest of gaming GPUs, or worse.     Basic video editing (mostly short videos)   This is where the 2000M may shine over the 1000M.  If you're transcoding video, or performing operations that modify the entire video (scaling, shake reduction, contrast adjustment, etc.), the 2000M will perform almost twice as fast as the 1000M.  If your editing consists mostly of local changes (cuts, fades, etc.), the difference will be low.
Mark's answer covers most of the main points, so I'm going to add this:  There are different types of GPUs. It's a common misconception that any GPU will work for any graphics intensive task (video editing, gaming, etc) - not so. The M series GPUs in your question are more geared to be editing GPUs - their optimization was mainly focused on calculations relating to video and graphics editing, rather than more physics-based multiple-step calculations that are used in gaming.  For your intended use, there's not a massive amount of difference between the two - if you're editing videos, especially long videos, then the 2kM will perform far better - but if you're only intending on doing basic, occasional editing then the extra $100 isn't worth it. Neither is there a massive difference between the two in gaming performance - if you want a good platform for gaming, you'd be better off looking at a console or gaming-optimized GPU'd PC.
I use the HP BR376AA 5-Button Optical Comfort Mouse. Which is a bit of a mouthful.   It's Â£13.20 (17,97â‚¬, $20.36) It's high-precision, works very well for gaming (I use it to play games quite a lot) Wired   Additionally...   It has 2 side buttons which are normally mapped to browser back/forward. You might be able to assign macros to them - I haven't researched this, but it seems viable. I got mine in the UK which is (sort of) in the EU. It's probably purchasable in mainland Europe, too. "Comfort" in HP speak means ergonomic. It's very nice to use.
If you're not planning to add more than one expansion card (say, a TV tuner card) to your system, a mini-ITX board in a low profile or home theater case fits your needs.  If you want two to four cards (tuner card, dedicated graphics card, dedicated network card, etc), a microATX board in a low profile case will work.  Note that a low-profile case uses narrow "low-profile" expansion cards with a special bracket; normal expansion cards won't fit.  Most home theater cases have a right-angle riser that lets you use a standard expansion card.  In both situations, you may need a power supply sized for the case rather than a standard ATX power supply.  Many smaller cases have bays for laptop (2.5") hard drives and slimline laptop optical drives instead of desktop-sized drives, so make sure you check this when selecting your parts.  In theory, you could fit a full-sized ATX board in the available space, but the logistics of placing the power supply, cooling system, expansion cards, etc. means you probably won't be able to find a case that can do the job.
The upcoming Moto X Force is the phone that sounds like the perfect fit. It has been announced for release in the US and will be released in other countries starting mid-November.  Specifications   5.42" QHD screen 2GHz 8-core Snapdragon 810 processor 3GB RAM 64GB of expandable storage IP68 certified &ndash; dust and water-resistant up to 1.5 meters and 30 minutes MIL-STD-810G certified &ndash; salt, dust, humidity, rain, vibration, solar radiation, transport and thermal shock resistant Corning Gorilla Glass 4 21MP main camera and 5MP front-facing camera 3760 mAh battery   Moto X info announcement via engadget.com  So if you can wait and you're willing to spend around &euro;500 that phone will be great for you!
Try some mice out at a local store, thats the best way to see if they fit in your hand and feel good and ergonomic for you.   And a real ergonomic mouse to prevent tennis elbow is something like this: CSL - TM137U optical sensor but i don't know if you want to use one of this kind. I think it would take some time to get used to it but health wise this shape is the best choice.
The Samsung Galaxy S6 Active is essentially a rugged version of the Samsung Galaxy 6 with a better battery, so I think that would be well suited to your needs. A review of the S6 Active is here.  If that is above your price range, apparently CAT makes phones now: http://www.catphones.com/ The S50 actually seems like a decent phone at a reasonable price, so you should check that out. Caterpillar created a promotional video as part of their "BuiltForIt" campaign that featured the phone.  Additionally, you could buy an Otterbox for a common phone and though it would be clunky, it would be able to withstand pretty much anything. I also have heard that Griffin makes very high quality phone cases.
The Fractal Design Node 202 is a very small form factor PC case (console size), with support for a full size graphics card. A link to the fractal design page for all their node series cases is here, and I suggest you check them out. It will come out soon and uses mini-ITX boards.  In addition, the Cooler Master Obsidian series has some very small form factor cases that would be a good fit for a home theater.  Silverstone also makes some very small form factor mini-ITX cases. A link to the Amazon page for the Silverstone Raven Z is here.
Assuming your plastic mouse pad is a good, solid color, the Logitech M500 (â‚¬27) is a fantastic laser mouse for the price. It's built for everyday use but can withstand occasional gaming. It's wired, ergonomically right-handed, has side macros, and 1000 DPI (which is more than enough for gaming).  One thing you should take caution to is the track type. For your purposes, laser mice are better since you have hard surfaces. Optical mice work well with soft surfaces.
I use the Etekcity Scroll X1. It costs $15. It has 4 extra buttons (2 Side Buttons and 2 more behind the mouse wheel) It fits perfectly in my hand (I use the fingertip grip, i.e. I only touch the mouse with the tips of my fingers and the bottom of the palm of my hand) It includes drivers, and it's very cheap. It is 2400 DPI, but for 18 dollars you can get a 4000 DPI Model and $26 will buy you a 8200 DPI Mouse -- which is just insane. You can see more info and buy it here.
I recently had the same problem and in the end went for the Soundsticks III from Harman Kardon. They look and sound beautiful. Sub is on feet though, but gives a really tight sound.    I got mine for â‚¬100 (around $120).   It has the following features:   Price around â‚¬99 (at least here in holland) 2.1 layout Subwoofer with: independent control, 20+ Watts, 6 inch external driver Subwoofer in on feet. Four, 1" full-range transducers per channel powered by a 10-watt amplifier for room-filling sound Touch volume and mute controls Angle-adjustable satellites Easy setup, one chord from every speaker to the subwoofer, a mini-jack input for connecting your device and a power input connected to the subwoofer.
The only Mini-ITX board I've been able to find with a PCIe x4 slot is the Mitac PH12LI.  It is not, however, any smaller than any of the PCIe x16 Mini-ITX boards.  Personally, I'd recommend a Casetronic C292 case, an over-the-board PCIe x16 riser card, and the PCIe x16 Mini-ITX board of your choice.  Your x4 card should work just fine in an x16 slot, and you won't need to go looking for parts that probably don't exist.  (No association with LogicSupply, they're just my go-to source for looking up all things Mini-ITX.)
I had good experience with "gaming" mouse from Logitech. Current corded lineup seems pretty narrow, MX500 appears to correspond to what I had.  Pros: it's quite wide which is good for hands; Cons: paying $30 for a mouse nowadays seems excessive.  I once bought a Microsoft mouse for a friend of mine who did computer graphics, which is just as demanding as gaming. Surprisingly Microsoft makes (or buys OEM) very good peripherals! 4500 (wired) and 900 (wireless) seem like decent models.  You can also consider low-end Razer.  Please visit a real brick and mortar store and at least try holding a mouse before you buy.
D-Link's wi-fi cameras provide the sort of thing you're looking for.  There are a number of models, and which one you need depends entirely on your use-case so I won't recommend one, but the page I linked above gives an overview of all the types.   They're wifi cameras, which is definitely wireless There's an interface (not sure if web or not, but probably given their wifi nature) Sends emails for movement alerts, including the relevant files Good motion detection (contrast changes don't register - it's actually looking for movement, not light levels) Records videos of motion (not sure of length, but probably at least 5 seconds). You can also connect a central hard drive to stream or record footage of longer periods - say a day, which you could review the footage of when you get home. All models have night vision, though the range varies from 15ft-26ft between models Has an Android and iPhone app   In short, sounds perfect for what you want.
I, and my son, both have Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and its survived all the things you were wondering about. You can get them at a very reasonable price on the worlds largest online vendor but make sure you get one that is compatible with your phone provider. You probably don't need the extra features that come with the S6 and if you manage to destroy a $200 device its a lot less painful then losing $700.  While I still think the S4 Active is a terrific phone and new ones (S4 Active) can be had for $139 on the aforementioned vendor you should make sure that you can still update the OS on the phone. I would look at a later version of the Samsung 'S' Active line because not only is it software update able but the cameras are so, so much better now. Currently I upgraded to a S7 and love it.
You might of heard of it, but the Intel Compute Stick is a very small PC running an Intel Atom processor (Atom Z3735F). The standard model has 32GB of flash storage and though it costs $150, it comes with Windows 10, which is nice even if you do plan on installing Linux. You can buy one here. I actually use this one.  There are two versions of the Intel Compute Stick. The first has Ubuntu preinstalled, 1GB of ram, and 8GB of on board storage. The other has Windows 8.1 installed, 2GB of ram, and 32GB of on board storage.
I think the best answer to your question is the Intel Compute Stick.  To answer your feature requests:   It is small-scale being in principle a HMDI stick (~100x27x13mm) It has a processor that is good enough (Atom Z3735F) It has 8GB (Ubuntu version) or 32GB (Windows version) of memory which is expandable by the MicroSDXC slot It has 1GB (ubuntu) or 2GB (windows) RAM It has all the usual Wifi standards (802.11b/g/n + Bluetooth 4.0)   If you can wait a few more months / weeks, a new version was announced at IFA 2015.
The Rexel Auto Feed Micro Cut series seems right for you.  It's a series of shredders, ranging from the 100M (which takes 100 sheets at 80gsm) up to the 750M (which takes 750 sheets at 80gsm).  On your requirements:   Any of the series can handle 100 sheets I can't actually tell how big the bins are relative to the load, but they look big enough to take more than one load Doesn't cut diamonds, but does cut each sheet into "2000 2 x 15 mm bits" You can probably put a bag inside the bin and mount the shredder to keep it in place, if that works for you Rexel make good quality stuff; their website doesn't say durability stats but I'd imagine they're pretty high.
It's not pocket sized, but it is portable: NeatReceipts. The scanner is 10.8"W x 1.6"D x 1.3"H and weighs less than a pound, allowing it to scan full sheets of paper.     Other features:    Scans in color, grayscale or black and white Optical Character Recognition (OCR) + Intelligent Text Recognition (ITR) Can scan 3-4 receipts per minute Software runs on OS X and Windows Software can send data to Excel, Turbo Tax, Quickbooks, Outlook, and export to JPG format, PDF and more
The AnkerÂ® Bluetooth Ultra-Slim Keyboard is a very small, cheap, and light Bluetooth keyboard, and it seems to be a good fit for your needs. It has full sized keys, and retails for 16.00. It also comes in both black and white. You can buy one here.   Another slightly more expensive option is the Jelly Comb Universal Back-lit keyboard. It retails for 20$, has all the same features as the AnkerÂ® keyboard, and is backlit. Coincidentally, this keyboard also comes in both white and black. You can buy one here.
It's a bit expensive (listed at $250 on Newegg and $290 on Amazon), but I recommend the Fatal1ty X99M Killer from ASRock. This particular board was reviewed by Tom's Hardware in December 2014. It received "Tomâ€™s Hardware Approved Award"   It has the following specs:   4x288 pin slots for DDR4 memory modules.  Supports up to 64GB of RAM.  2 x PCI Express 3.0 x16 Slots (a third x16 slot is PCI Express 2.0) 10x6Gb/s SATA ports 6 USB 3.0 (2 Front, 4 Rear), 8 USB 2.0 (4 Front, 3 Rear, 1 Fatal1ty Mouse Port) Dual gigabit lan ports UEFI Bios and the ability to enter into Bios automatically on the next restart because:     Restart to UEFI      Fast Boot is so fast that it is impossible for users to enter the UEFI setup utility during POST. Therefore, ASRock Restart to UEFI technology allows users to easily enter the UEFI setup utility automatically when turning on the PC next time. It is designed for those who constantly need to enter the UEFI setup utility.      -  ASRock material on the board    This is a micro ATX board. It'll fit in pretty much any case you can throw at it. The concern with a smaller case (if you stick with the micro ATX) will be how well a large video card fits.
I always initially recommend ASUS motherboards because of their build quality and great support among other things.   The ASUS Q87M-E/CSM ($130) works with i7/i5 CPUs, 6 SATA 6Gb/s ports, micro ATX form factor, and built in features such as ASUS GPU Boost and BIOS EZ mode for easier overclocking. The ASUS A88X-PRO ($120) works with AMD Athlon/A- Series CPUs, supports a wide range of memory frequencies, 64GB max RAM, and lots of helpful ASUS features such as MemOK! and USB BIOS flashback.   I've had many bad experiences with ASRock motherboards in the past as many others have, so I tend to stay away from that brand.
The Planon SS100 is the only truly portable scanner I could find.     You can scan up to 600 images before having to dump them onto your computer via USB Charges over USB Monochrome or color scans Includes software for organization and OCR   One little downfall which you probably won't care about is that it can't scan wide documents like 8.5x11" paper. It's great for receipts, IDs, or other small things.
Consider this logically, RAID controller has to record your config somewhere, if you had RAID-0 or RAID-1 for example. Some do that in own flash memory, others do that on the disk. In the latter case an area on each disk must be allocated to store configuration. There's no guarantee that different manufactures would pick same format. Same goes for checksums for higher-level RAID schemes.  Good news is that RAID-1 is easy to recover in either case -- try whole disk, or if that doesn't work, find an offset and use data starting from that offset.  Your old setup could be:   no raid metadata -- you can simply plug one disk into regular motherboard and boot; This is most likely for onboard RAID controllers, as they can store metadata in BIOS config. disks first partitioned and then partitions are raided with metadata -- you'll have to adjust start of partition in the partition table disks first raided with metadata and then volume is partitioned -- you may have to create new partition table (bios) or may be ok (gpt)   Trying the first costs you nothing.  Wrt. the other two, you can try disk cloning software, your layout may be recognized ;-)
I'm surprised no one has thought to suggest a Skylake based platform. Unfortunately, the CPUs only have 20 lanes of PCI-E, so the second x16 has to come off the PCH, or divide bandwidth in half (PCI-E x8). Not really much of a problem if it's used for GPUs though.  My recommendation is the Gigabyte Z170 Gaming 5. 4 DDR4 DIMM slots, 6 SATA III (6 Gb/s), 3 SATA Express, and 2 M.2 slots as storage interfaces. 3 back panel and 4 headers for USB 3.0, 4 back panel and 2+2 headers for USB 2.0, and two back panel USB 3.1 slots, one is USB A, one is USB C. There are two Gigabit LAN ports.  The motherboard currently costs $160 at superbiiz, and yes, there is a UEFI BIOS.  Here's the spec sheet: http://www.gigabyte.com.au/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5498#sp
Due to the fact that this is novelty on the market, it would be not that easy to find exacly what you want but Elgato Thunderbolt Dock is relatively close. We can expect that they will release similar model with Thunderbolt 3.   Two Thunderbolt 2 ports Built-in HDMI port Built-in Gigabit Ethernet  Three USB 3.0 ports
I've been using the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition for the last few years:          Last for a reasonably long time (measured in weeks with ~1hr/day of medium use) on batteries, I don't want to be feeding it all the time      I've gotten months at a time out of it, but I haven't been able to get a good idea of the real maximum battery life on it because I replace the batteries (4, AAA) before every test that matters.        Have statistical capabilities, I'm TAing an AP Statistics class this year      I used it throughout AP Stats last year, and the curriculum was based on the student having a TI-83/84. This calculator seems to be the standard that they write the books to.         Be usable on an AP exam. I don't want the test trolls to steal my calculator and leave me helpless on the test.      I've used this on every test I've taken, from an AP Stats test to the SAT and ACT.         Be reasonably rugged, meaning I can throw it in my backpack without    worry      That's what I've been doing for the last few years, and it looks brand new.         Be reasonably fast, meaning I'm not sitting there drumming my fingers during a test while it chews on something      This is my main gripe. It's fast... enough. You'll still notice a delay when solving some problems, especially ones involving statistical regression, which really shouldn't be there in 2015.        Be within a budget, ideally < $150. Much less would be appreciated.      Available for ~$140 at various stores, but when I bought it a few years ago I seem to remember getting it at Wal-Mart for ~$110. Shop around a little bit.   Also, there is now a version of the calculator with a color display, the TI-84 CE. I don't have any experience with it, so I can't provide a recommendation.   Relevant:
TI-89  I own a TI-84 (see Undo's answer), but my school provides students with TI-89s (TI-89 Titanium, specifically) for math classes, which I find to be much more useful. I used it throughout my AP Calculus AB and AP Calculus BC classes, as well as for other AP sciences. It's quite handy.     â€¢Last for a reasonably long time (measured in weeks with ~1hr/day of medium use) on batteries, I don't want to be feeding it all the time   I recharged my school-issued TI-89 once over the course of a school year.     â€¢Have statistical capabilities, I'm TAing an AP Statistics class this year   The specifications page quotes the TI-89 as having     Statistics plots including scatter, xy-line, box and modified box plots. Histograms and regression lines are available.   I haven't used these functions myself, but I've heard that they are helpful.     â€¢Be usable on an AP exam. I don't want the test trolls to steal my calculator and leave me helpless on the test.   TI-89s are allowed on the exam.     â€¢Be reasonably rugged, meaning I can throw it in my backpack without worry   I have yet to do an intentional drop test, but my classmates and I have inadvertently done many in the past. The case improves the calculator's resistance to damage.     â€¢Be reasonably fast, meaning I'm not sitting there drumming my fingers during a test while it chews on something   The TI-89 is reasonably fast, so long as you don't throw a complicated integral at it. But even Wolfram Alpha would be hard-pressed to quickly solve something that complicated (I've tried!).     â€¢Be within a budget, ideally < $150. Much less would be appreciated.   TI-89s are expensive, but typically a bit under $150 (see here, for example, at $142.48).     â€¢Have a rechargeable battery, built in or otherwise   I've never used a TI-89 with rechargeable batteries, but I don't know that they won't work.     â€¢Color display, but battery life comes first   The TI-89 does not have a color display.
Acer generally has great home theater projectors with tons of positive ratings on both Amazon and Newegg.  The Acer H6510BD ($590) has pretty much everything you need.   Minimum of 4000 hours of lamp life &mdash; has eco options to extend this 10000:1 contrast ratio to bring out colors and get darker darks 1080p resolution supporting screens from 40-300 inches Two HDMI inputs plus others &mdash; has speakers to utilize HDMI audio if needed Only weighs 4.8 pounds, very small compared to others of its caliber Â±40 degree vertical keystone for mounting on high ceilings And of course an array of useful Acer-only features to improve image quality and performance   This seems to be the best buy for the price. I've seen so many other projectors around this price that perform horribly.  Here's a video reviewing it against a large wall (80"). You can see vibrant colors and excellent brightness.
I have used the FUJITSU Document Scanner ScanSnap iX500 and been very happy with it. It's a higher priced scanner though. It's currently $500 at Staples and $400 on Amazon.     Is not a printer Various paper sizes, including A4 and automatically recognizes the size of the paper.  Duplex capable Windows and OS X drivers. Dimensions: 292 mm x 159 mm x 168 mm (11.5 in. x 6.2 in. x 6.6 in.) Weight: 3.0 kg (6.62 lb.) Can scan wirelessly to a device (PC, Mac, iOS or Android devices) Scans to searchable PDFs It can scan approximately 20 pages per minute, in my experience. The official specs say 25 ppm. I can't recall the last time it jammed on me. Amazon reviews seem to agree:   -EastSide     Improved paper handling mechanism. Regular paper documents rarely jam or misfeed on the S1500. Only if you have stuck, very thin, bended, irregular or wrinkled sheets. I threw in different types of papers and it seems to take them in better! This is a real usability improvement.     -MoonX     Well like I said, I've got about 15,000 documents through this thing and haven't had a single problem with it feeding documents, jamming, or anything. I've used scanners almost twice the price of the iX500 that had more problems.   -GhostFaceReviewer     I had crinkled papers and it would never jam. Even thin receipts from years ago would be detected and never jammed.   Macworld compared this scanner to another product I've used (and would also recommend): NeatDesk. In the review Macworld noted:     Not surprisingly, given these different approaches, the ScanSnap iX500 hardware outshines NeatDesk. The ScanSnap is faster, less prone to jams and produces superior scan quality.    The different approaches being referenced are NeatDesk's "software company with some hardware" vs Fijitsu's "hardware company with some software" approach.
I've been using Logitech G700s for two years and I can recommend it as both ergonomic and reliable.   Ergonomic mouse â€” sure, it is. Rotated angle for hand - not 0Â° or 90Â°, but a mix â€” yes, looks like about 20Â° Low(er) cost â€” usually $100, but today Logitech sells it for $50, making it a low(er) cost mouse. Have no idea of how long the sale will last.  Mouse wheel not with middle finger â€” it's with the index finger. Can be either wired/USB â€” both USB wire (can be unplugged) and wireless (Logitech reciever, not Bluetooth). forward/backward button â€” 8 extra customizable buttons (4 on thumb, 3 on index, 1 for mode switching) and wheel tilt. I actually have a pair of buttons for forward and backward and another pair for scrolling desktops on OS X.
I recommend Clover. Clover is a combination of hardware (PoS terminals, printers, barcode scanners, etc.) and software.   Starting with the hardware, you have three options.    Mini Mobile Station   Each of these can take user credit cards. The Station is your main cashier terminal. It is stationary. The Mini is an "extender" for the Station. These are useful for surges - ie. the yearly festival in your town that causes your business to have lines around the corner for a weekend. They provide much of the functionality of the Station, but you don't need it much of the time. The Mobile is useful for the traveling server. They can carry it to the table and place orders, or during your hypothetical yearly festival, can travel down the line of customers and take their order before they get to the Station.  Along with the base PoS stations, Clover has several accessories. These include barcode scanners, printers (including kitchen printers), weight scales, debit pads (though, the same functionality is available on the PoS terminals themselves) and more.  Next comes the software. Clover has an App Market with a large amount of add on applications. The downside is that many of these are monthly subscription based. I encourage you to look through these apps though. I can see several that look like they'd be useful for a diner (including tip suggestions). There are also things that aren't Point of Sale specific. I see apps for time clocks, inventory management, multi-store management, coupons, analytics of your customers and more.   Lastly, there is a developer API (which the apps in the App Market use). If you find there isn't an app that you need and you have developer experience (or can hire a developer), it appears that there is code and documentation available to help you do it.  Regarding your question about credit cards, Clover provides you with a Merchant account on First Data. If you have a merchant account with someone else, Clover encouages you to talk with them to see if they sell Clover.
E-ink is a solution for your #1 and #2.  Personally, I can recommend Kindle. I've been using my ebook reader for 3 years and it made a big relief for my eyes.  In my case it's Kindle Keyboard but version with touchscreen display is also available on the market:  Kindle, 6" Glare-Free Touchscreen Display for Â£59.99  or  All-New Kindle Paperwhite, 6" with Built-in Light for Â£109.99   You don't have to care that much about storage because popular formats like epub or mobi are really lightweight. 4 GB makes you able to hold thousands of books.   Battery life (from amazon):     A single charge lasts up to four weeks, based on half an hour of   reading per day with wireless off. Battery life will vary based on   wireless usage   This description has much in common with reality. E-ink display consumes power only when the displayed pages change. This is the main difference in comparison to LCD display.   Goodreads integration is possible (Amazon bought this company):      Goodreads on Kindle lets you connect with the Goodreads community,   follow friends and see what they are reading, and share and rate books   on your Kindle. You can also shop for Kindle books and purchase   selected titles directly within Goodreads. Help for Kindle Voyage (7th   Generation), Kindle Paperwhite (7th Generation), Kindle (7th   Generation), and Kindle Paperwhite (6th Generation).       Source: Amazon
The digital board you're upgrading to should have individual monitor volumes. If not, I'd say it's a crappy board. That said, not many high-quality/professional-grade monitoring headphones have dedicated volume control anymore. It's usually all done through the hardware or software you connect them to.  Anyway, the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO ($200) is absolutely amazing for what you're doing. I've had the pleasure of using a pair of these for audio production and they're top-notch.   250 ohms and 5-35,000 Hz range Acoustically closed diffuse-field Extremely comfortable ear pads and headband All parts are replaceable 9.8 feet of coiled cable   I highly recommend these.
A short answer would be a Windows machine.  Why?  Because it is cheaper than a Mac machine, and both the machines offer the same support, and none have any significant advantages over the other when it comes to web dev. or specifically front-end development.  This Reddit thread might also be of some help for you to decide.  So, if money is not a burden, then you can go for either one, without any bias when it comes to ease of development tools.
I strongly suggest a Windows machine. There are a bunch of reasons for this, some more important than others, so here goes:  Pricing Windows machines are usually significantly cheaper than Macs by at least $300. Since you're just doing web dev and probably some slightly heavy multitasking, no need for a big price tag.  Software The big one, Notepad++, isn't available for Mac. This text editor has FTP Sync which allows you to connect to a database and live edit and reupload files &mdash; a huge time-saver. That and the hundreds of other great features it has that make writing things like HTML, CSS, or JS a breeze.  Hardware This is where the biggest feats are. You, of course, have a far larger selection of laptop specs with Windows. Although a Mac might do just fine for you, you still might want less of something you won't need much of (e.g. video capabilities) so you won't have to pay as much.  The other huge thing about Windows machines is the choice of a touch screen and similar technologies. A touch screen is an excellent thing to have at your disposal as a web developer because you'll need to develop for mobile, so all you'll need to do is use your laptop as if it were a big phone or tablet. Without this, mobile development can be a massive pain.  Macbooks are famous for having almost none of the ports people need for everyday activities (as I'll state below, compatibility isn't great). With a Windows machine, you, again, have a wide selection of USB ports, video/audio ports, etc. This may not be a big deal for many, but I personally find it a great benefit.  Other Windows is the most widely used OS in business (which is where web dev falls under) because of it's dependability and compatibility. Very few things are compatible with OSX compared to Windows and that's a big deal when it comes to software availability, workflows, and general productivity in business.    Now, keep in mind that Mac isn't terrible either. It does have some extremely useful straight-out-of-the-box features like an eyedropper and the ability to view every window you have open at the same time (good for organization).
In terms of price it would be better to choose Windows.  Front-end developers often use Macs because of the healthy balance between unix-based system and "working out of the box". There was an option to install Photoshop CS2 on Ubuntu. I wish it could be possible for every version :D. http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/01/photoshop-cs2-available-for-free-works-fine-in-wine   According to @Adam's answer, I can say that using Sublime Text with some Live Reload plugin will do a better job than Notepad++.   In your case the most important part is connected with browser compatibility rather than system itself. The only program that needs better hardware is Photoshop but it also depends on the size of the project.  Console in Windows is not a big problem because you can do a lot of things in the browser's built-in inspector.  Running a server on your localhost is easy too. They are plenty of tools like XAMPP which contain basic software in one package.
I'd say you should choose a Windows platform.  Windows, in general, will give you a more flexible platform to work from.   The vast majority of programs work with Windows (not that I have stats for this - but when looking for software, the most common download type seems to be for Windows) It's dead easy to run a web server off a Windows platform: either Microsoft's IIS, or Apache using a WAMP stack will work fine. I run WampServer on my own computer. If you can, get one with Windows 10. WinX now comes with some of the advanced features that a Mac has; as Adam mentions that you can view all open windows simultaneously, it's worth noting that X can do this too. There is a much higher degree of compatibility with Windows in many areas than there is with Mac OS X. You get flexibility in specification that a Macbook simply can't parallel; there are laptops designed so you can take them apart and change any component inside them. As Adam rightly mentions, Windows is used in 99% of web development in the business world. If you get used to OS X, then you'll have to re-learn where everything is when you get a job.   Of course, everyone mentions that Windows is also the cheaper option - but it's a significant point for students, so it really is worth strong consideration.    If you're looking for a concrete recommendation, I'd recommend my laptop, which is an Acer Aspire E1-572. (NB: the linked page doesn't quite reflect the laptop I have, but it's pretty close.) Quoting the label I've got in front of me:        Intel Core i3-4010U (1.7 GHz, 3 MB L3 cache)   Intel HD Graphics 4400, up to 1792 MB Dynamic Video Memory   15.6" HD LED LCD   8GB DDR3 L Memory   1000 GB HDD   DVD-Super Multi DL drive      Plus a number of other, less relevant specs. It's not a massively powered machine, but it's certainly adequate for front-end development, which is what I use it for regularly. The lower power and spec also serves to reduce the price: I got mine for around Â£300.
The Sennheiser HD range of headphones is one of the most comprehensive ranges on the market, and can suit a number of different needs. It ranges from the HD 203's I use at home (around Â£50, 15-19k Hz) right up to the HD 800's that are professional headphones (Â£1000, 8-50k Hz).  Now, I probably wouldn't recommend either of these extremes - the 203's are good, but they probably don't match your current phones, and the 800's are extremely expensive.  Of the range, I'll recommend you the HD 600's. They:   Are widely compatible. I don't see any issues with using them for P/A FL feeds. Have good passive noise cancelling, thanks to the foam in the ear rests and the hard yet open-backed design. Are fairly expensive, unfortunately. They're Â£370 new ($570), though you can usually find a couple pairs on Amazon or eBay for a couple hundred less. (If that's too much, take a look at the HD 558's, which have marginally reduced specs for a lower price (around $249).) No volume adjustment. This feature is actually pretty rare these days. Though I would expect your new sound desk to have independent volume controls for each PHONE OUT socket. Have 3m (9 and a bit feet) of coiled cable. 260g weight, 300 Î© impedance, 12-39k Hz response, 97dB pressure level, and light wearing contact force at 2.5N.
I agree with Firepower and SEJPM that the Intel Compute Stick is the route to go for around $150 but if you are looking for a cheaper version of that, the MeeGoPad T02 is a great alternative for $79 (The Ubuntu Version) and around $109 (The Windows 8.1 with upgrade to Windows 10 Version)  Both sticks have a Intel Atom Z3735f processor, 2GB's of Ram and 32 GB's of flash storage and connect through HDMI. In addition they have 2 full sized USB 2 ports, Wi-Fi B/G/N and Bluetooth 4.0. Finally they have a micro sd slot with support for up to 32 GB's of extra storage  Ubuntu Version: here  Windows Version: here
The Crosscall Shark V2 seems to fit almost all your requirements. Almost, because with the current exchange rate (Euros to USD) it costs 101$.  It:   floats (water resistant) is IP68 certificated   There are two other phones you may want to look into. The Caterpillar B25 and the newer B30. Here's a comparison of the two.  The only real difference is the battery life. Based on the above linked comparison, the B25 has a bigger battery capacity (1300 mAh vs. 1000 mAh), but the stand-by time is almost 100 hours lower, although the talk time is 3.5 hours higher. Well, on the CAT homepage they seem to have the same talk time. But the B25 has much more detailed specs there than the B30.  Only the (factory) price is a bit high. It's about 157.90$ (140 Euros), but, as you stated in your question, since second-hand items are acceptable you'll find both phones much cheaper online (50-100$), for example on eBay.  Both CAT phones are:   IP67 certificated water resistant up to 1 meter (3.3 feet) for 30 minutes Drop-to-concrete resistant from up to 1.8m (5.9 feet)   I can't make a statement about the call sound quality because I have never held one of those phone in my hand. If you can, check the phones out in a store and compare the sound quality.
The Microsoft Lumia 430 is a nice bet. It was Nokia when I bought it, but it's just the name which has changed and not the specs. I used it for around 2 years, so I can vouch for it.   Price: With the current dollar-rupee exchange rate, it would be around $75 Durability and quality: It is pretty robust, and durable (have used it for 2 years, and now, my Mom uses it). Water resistant too. Battery Life: Pretty decent. Goes on for 2 straight days with around 2 and a half hours of talking everyday.   (1500 mAh) Sound Quality: Bot the sound and call quality are at par with the top android phones in the market. price range: As mentioned, it costs around $75
I'd also recommend a Samson company.  If you don't have a problem with buying second-hand items, you can get a Samson Go Mic for less than $30 or buy a brand new one for $38 from amazon.  Pros:   Portable USB condenser microphone  Plug and Play  Useful clip (you don't have to buy another accessory to keep it in a place)  "Natural" sound (perfect for podcasts) - check this comparison.   This is a very popular model and you can find reliable reviews like this one.
If you want to consolidate remote controls, I always recommend a Logitech Harmony. There are various models that have additional features (ie. touch screens, how many devices it can control at once, quick setup, etc.)  One awesome thing about all models of the Harmony, is that they all use the same database for compatibility. You can search if your devices are available: here. Logitech boasts of compatibility with 250K+ devices across 7K manufacturers. Chances are high that it is compatible by default. If not, you can still program it using a device's original remote.  Personally, I have the Harmony 650.     I use it to control a television, receiver, bluray player and stereo. Set up of each device to use the Harmony takes a little bit of time but once a the Harmony knows the device and the on/off macros I use to get everything on and how I want it when I sit to relax, it's very nice.
I have some potential options that may be helpful.  Option 1: Using an in-between hardware solution  One option would be Screens a product that resides between the screen itself and your inputs. It is in Kickstarter now but allows you to customize a good number of inputs by running its own internal software. Another option that is available now from my understanding is the Cadent.  Option 2: Using software at the source to split the image  The cheapest option would be to use software on the host to do this for you, however I think this may not be an option based on the source of the content (camera or central DVR unit) you have.  Option 3: The continued search for a screen with more than two hardware inputs  Currently, most monitors/or TVs that allow multiple simultaneous input only allow two inputs and are in the expensive price range for example. For example I have the (as cheap as I could find 4k) Samsung LU28D590DS. It has two HDMI inputs that can be run at the same time. However as 4k becomes more mainstream there might be more options for simultaneous inputs.  Edit1: @Aditya Somani found one with four inputs  Edit2: @Nathan Osman Also found a screen that should work.    On a side note, a DVI cable can be converted to HDMI though a cheap adapter. Likewise a Displayport adapters exist however are slightly more dependent on the source of the signal or require an active signal processer.
I recently bought the Logitech G930 ($100) headset for gaming and music and I can honestly say it's the best headset I've ever used.   Circumaural and fits to ear shape (it isn't circular like most headsets &mdash; something that causes a lot of discomfort after an hour or two of wearing it) Dolby 7.1 surround sound that sounds almost just as good as sitting in a room surrounded by a 7.1 setup USB connection1 Programmable keys  and volume directly on the headset that can be set to do anything you could ever want (to interact with Windows further than is allowed, see this SU post) Extremely comfortable ear pads and headband &mdash; the headband is a semi-memory foam and the ear pads are just foam Mic that folds up and down &mdash; auto-mutes when folded up (one of the best features IMO) The companion Logitech software lets you adjust individual EQ frequencies, channel volumes, and talkback volume And of course an excellent sound range: 20Hz-20KHz and 30 Ohms   1 The G930 has a base that connects to the PC via USB, and to charge the headset, a micro USB comes out of the base (a decent length). For the headset to work, a USB wireless receiver can be plugged into the top of the base or directly into the computer. It's a strange setup but it works. Check pictures for more detail.  The connection thing is greatly outweighed by the good features of this headset. You won't notice it after you set it up.
I'm going to recommend the baby brother of Adam's answer: the Logitech G430.    Regular price is around $75.    It fits over the entire ear (and isn't circular). I can wear it for hours at a time with no discomfort.  7.1 surround sound. It works very well in both games and movies.  Noise canceling microphone. Team mates in games mentioned that the clarity is very good (and were appreciative when I started using this headset compared to my cheap previous one). The ear cups fold flat, so you can lay it flat on a desk. USB connection with on cable controls for volume adjustment and ability to mute the microphone. It is a wired headset, but the cable 7.5 feet long. This length has been fine for me. The headset actually has 3.5mm connections that plug into the USB dongle, if you wish to go that route.    Finally, I got my set at QuakeCon 2014 and have nice orange padding vs. the blue that you get at retail.
Whenever I hear "heatsink" I immediately think of the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO (~$30). I, along with tons of other people, will instantly recommend this over anything else. It's actually gained sort of a cult following for how great it is.   Fits LGA 2011 sockets and many others 2x120mm fans (600-2000 RPM) 9-36dB &mdash; 9dB on the lowest setting is insanely quiet, 36dB is still great too Four pipes and the large number of aluminum fins directly remove heat for faster cooling Outstanding performance for pretty much any workload   And of course, temperature management is awesome for the price. This graph shows the 212 EVO's idle and load temperatures compared to others of the same capacity. It isn't the coolest heatsink on the market right now &mdash; you can get unimaginably cool ones now &mdash; but since heatsinks are, after all, all about temperature, price goes way up as temp goes down. The 212 EVO sits at above average in every category.
I recommend Square's card reader. You can get the magstripe reader for free from Square. This should imply to you that most of their service is on the software side. They also advertise a contactless reader for NFC and chip cards as "coming soon", though you can reserve it for free. If you don't care about the "contactless" part, they have a reader that will read the new chip cards already available for $30.    I have had the magstripe reader for a few years. I use it for personal payments. It's supported every Android device I've had since the OS was version 2.0. It also supports my iPad and has run just fine through all OS upgrades in the last few years.  They have additional software related features you may find useful, though I can't vouch for any of those. These include a full PoS system, employee management, a market place and the ability to set up an online store through them.   Importantly, their rates are reasonable (for my limited use):   Per swipe, sale on the Online store or Square Invoices: 2.75%   (Swipe in $100, and you get $97.25) Per manually entered transaction: 3.5% + 15 cents (Enter $100 and you get $96.35)   Both methods accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover and American Express (with the same rates). Deposits go into your bank account within two business days.   As I said above, I use my Square reader for personal things. Usually payments among friends/family. I've also used it when hosting a garage sale. I feel that was very helpful in getting rid of more "stuff", compared to previous years where I didn't use the reader. Square will email a receipt to the customer and Square protects you for a small amount of charge backs (though, I have never used this feature).
I personally use Etymotic HF5, and have used the cheaper ER-6i in the past (though I think they replaced that with the MC5). The Etymotics are in-ear-canal phones, and function as ear plugs, giving over a 35dB reduction in sound levels.  They also play music really well, even at quite low volumes. That 35dB of noise isolation goes a long way to letting you listen at low volumesâ€”you can listen low enough that quietly humming to yourself (not blocked by earplugs because that vibration is not carried via air) will drown out the music.  One tip: The cord carries vibrations like crazy. Not a huge problem sitting in a chair, but moving it is. Greatly improved by having the cord exit the earphone towards the bottom-front of your ear, then wrapping the cord over the top of your earâ€”that stops almost all vibration noises.  BTW: There are cheaper earphones of a similar style. Haven't used them so I can't vouch for them.
I currently use an LG 29UM67 which is a 21:9 monitor which supports the features you are talking about. I was able to get it on Amazon for about 350USD and it supports upto 4 inputs simultaneously, either with different inputs or daisy chaining I believe.  Here is a link to LG's website for the same - http://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-29UM67-P-ultrawide-led-monitor
First of all, a small disclaimer. Bear in mind that whatever external fans you may feasibly buy and install will provide much less efficient cooling than an internal one, mostly due to proximity and heat dissipation efficiency (there's a reason why the fan is usually close to the heatsink, which is in direct contact with the CPU).  Running the computer under these conditions will have a high risk of damage due to overheating.  Now, on to your actual question.  I've had heating issues with previous Dell laptops that I've owned (Vostro, Inspiron), and have used cooling pads/mats to great effect.  In particular, Cooler Master makes good cooling pads, like this slim cooling pad in your price range.  I would definitely recommend something like this for a simple, store-bought solution.  You could also go for a more involved, probably more expensive and DIY solution, like building your own fan assembly with a high-performance fan (such as this one from Noctua, which makes some of the best air coolers for CPUs).  I have no experience with something like this, other than putting together cooling kits, but I would think they may give you better cooling performance.  Then again, they might not.  I would recommend this only if you like the challenge of building it, which might be really fun :).  Best of luck!
You might consider just adding a microphone to your setup (i.e. "convert" your headphones to a headset), like this lapel microphone from Zalman. That's what I've bought to use with my Sennheiser HD558's to great effect, and it costs around $9.    You could also purchase a USB sound system, like this Creative X-Fi external pre-amp and sound system, which you can get for around $90.  I'm not an audiophile (though I enjoy good sound), and I don't think that's audiophile quality - but if you're into good sound without being an audiophile, that's probably a good setup.  The upside is, you don't have to change your current headphones and you will get a better sound than other systems, in my humble opinion.     Best of luck with your search, and have fun!
The answer is simple: yes, switching from HDDs to SSDs is a huge improvement but that depends on the write and read speed of the SSDs themselves.  Personally I gave up a 1TB HDD for a 240GBs SSD and it was the best choice ever. (programming, OS and gaming refference)  The SSD's write and read speeds are different from one SSD to another. Personally I have one with the same write&read speed, about 540MBs/s.  It depends on the manufacturer and also the product itself.
I have a Logitech G930 headset, which I am quite happy with.  On the plus side:   Good quality speakers Good quality microphone Good wireless range Microphone mute button on the headset Microphone automatically mutes when folded up Has a practical base with a long wire for charging with a connector of better quality than most other micro USB chargers.   On the negative side:   If the microphone touches something the noise feeds back through the speakers. (Even if the microphone is muted.) If you temporarily move out of wireless range while microphone is muted it gets un-muted as you move back within range. You will hear an annoying noise if you stay just on the edge of wireless range. The microphone on my first G930 broke after about a year. (But I was happy enough with my experience that I did use the refund I got under the warranty to buy a new G930).   The speakers do cover the ears and keeps out most of the ambient noise as you are asking for. Keeping out ambient noise can be a plus or a minus depending on circumstances, for example you might want to be able to hear a phone or a door bell.
The Logitech MX Master has a configurable scroll wheel which you can customize to either click-by-click or autoscroll.  Quote (emphasis mine):     Speed-adaptive scroll wheel      Scroll through long documents or web pages faster and easier. The precision wheel auto-shifts from click-to-click to hyper-fast scroll.      Logitech Optionsâ„¢ software lets you customize this experience.    The scroll wheel is also the middle mouse button Ergonomic form factor that's not specific to gaming
It depends mainly on the type of NAND the SSD uses, and also somewhat on the controller.  Higher quality SLC NAND stores one bit per cell. This make the cells much faster and longer lived, whereas MLC and TLC (2 bits and 3 bits) degrade more easily and are harder to read and write, especially write. Since the MLC SSDs are more common, most SSDs do have slow writes (compared to their reads)  If you just run out and get the cheapest SSD, you're likely to find yourself something faster than a HDD by only the slightest margins in read speed, like the Kingston SSDVNow. In some circumstances, this SSD will be slower than a HDD.  Larger SSDs are also faster, because they're composed of multiple chips effectively in RAID 0 (it's similar).  OCZ Vertex, Sandisk Extreme and Samsung Pro are all models to look for if you want the fastest performance.   Alternatively, if you're on a budget (who isn't), the Samsung EVO, OCZ ARC (they've renamed their mid range a few times, but I'm pretty sure this is the newest), and the Crucial MX range are easier on the wallet.  Be sure to find some benchmarks before you buy, and remember that the newest isn't always the best. The older SSDs on larger processes are often longer lived, if you're making lots of writes. Also check out the newer SSDs with 3D V-NAND if you're concerned.
In Asia, in particular Thailand and India, there are a lot of cheap and popular dual SIM phones. In fact most people seem to have dual SIM phones - I'm not particularly sure why, but I think multiple boyfriends/girlfriends may be partly the reason.   These are all quite similar to the good old Nokia 3310, that is to say, a physical keyboard, and a small, non-touch, screen. These are often around the $40 mark or less, so well within your price bracket. The Nokia 107, for example:    Some others are the Nokia 206, 208, 215, 220, 222, 225, 301, and 515.  This is by no means the full list, but as you can see there are plenty to choose from. Whether these models are available in your country is another question, as they are obviously targeted towards the emerging nascent mobile phone markets, where lost cost is important. In more affluent countries, these may be considered "throw-away" phones, but they do meet your criteria, and do make for great holiday phones.  Also, because there is no touch screen and a smaller screen, the battery life is longer on these phones in general, and only require a charge every other day, unlike most smart phones.
Given your description of the shortcomings of your current camera, you want a camera with a large sensor (improved low-light performance and less "noise"), a very large optical zoom range, and a very wide wide-angle view.  Measured in degrees, you need an 84Ëš field of view (or larger) for a rainbow, and a 5Ëš field of view (or smaller) for a distant airplane.  Measured in "35mm equivalent focal length", you need a focal length of 19mm (or shorter) for a rainbow, and 500mm focal length (or longer) for a distant airplane.  Zoom factor (numbers like "10x" or "4x") is meaningless without knowing the focal length/field of view of one end of the zoom range.  You need at least a 25x optical zoom range; given that manufacturers usually bias their zoom range towards the telephoto end rather than the wide end, you may need to go much higher -- this will get expensive, and image quality at the extreme ends of the zoom range will be poor.  Pixel count is generally one of the least important criteria when selecting a camera.  One of these two images was created with a 6 MP camera, while the other was created with a 10 MP camera and scaled down.  Which do you think is which?
As said in the comments, if you care about the battery life then look at the number of mAh the replacement battery has. The Samsung original battery for Galaxy S4 Mini is 1900 mAh so you want something higher, e.g. Zerolemon Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini 5100mAh. Beware that some batteries are too thick to fit in the original phone case, so they come with a thicker case. Also, there exist a bunch of applications that help detecting which applications take the most of your battery, you might want to optimize on the software side as well.
If you already have a door you could just add in a new smartphone controlled controller, e.g.  https://garageio.com/  Garageio is the simple and secure way to control and monitor your garage door from anywhere in the world, all without needing to replace your existing opener. The Garageio blackbox can easily be installed in your home garage, allowing control of up to three separate garage doors.  It is wifi enabled.    The one door garageio box costs $199.
Kingston has a few excellent encrypted flash drive solutions. Their flash drives are always high-quality and are known for their reliability.  Kingston DataTraveler Vault Privacy 3.0 Their basic encrypted flash drive.

I would recommend the Anker 10-port USB hub.  It's a little bit on the expensive side, as it is normally listed for just under $80, but there is a sale on Amazon that has it listed for $33. Here are some of the features:   Data Transfer to 5 Gb/s on all 7 available ports.  3 Additional "charging" ports that provide 2.1A so they can easily charge your phones, and your tablets. 4.4 stars from 1100 reviews, I've got to say that's pretty good :)     It looks fairly good as well, not ugly like a lot of other multi hubs. Hope that works out for you :)
With the information given, I would recommend the NZXT Sentry 3 or Sentry 2 fan controller. You can buy one here. The reviews are good, the only cons being that sometimes the controller does not work out of the box and that it is easy to make a mess out of the cables. The LED touch screen is of good quality as well.
Your criteria are impossible to merge together and here is why, ordered by cost.   You need a 10 year reliable storage that can handle more or less industrial quality requirements.   This is a quite high requirement. Industrial quality is gained by using better materials/components and so have an higher cost. You need a technology that is still around 10 years later. This one is also quite difficult to obtain. As you say: you must use only very popular method of archiving witch exclude almost every archiving technology (even tape) because they evolve and, in a 10 year timespan, are not backward compatible.   Those two points come against a cheap method of archiving.  Forgetting your point 3rd here is what I can tell you:   Tape won't resist time under industrial environment. You need to keep them in a dry zone with a constant regular temperature (it does hates humidity and high temperature variation). Ignoring point 2: DVD is still a good way to keep your 10 year. You just need to buy DVD with a high quality. Be warned: lifetime warranty is considered to be 5 years. So be sure that your DVD is 10 years warranty and burned with a low speed (the higher speed the more you put errors witch, in time, will turn into definitive errors due to the time decay of the DVD). Last but not least: you buy a very specific technology (like Iomega Zip at that time) that is native with Linux. you buy various readers/burners and use only one at a time. Linux compatibility will ensure you 10+ years of support of your drive (not the case under Windows). If your device comes down then you replace it with a new one that you buy and if you can't find it you use the one that you kept.   You must consider to make your backup plan over a 5 years cycle and store your backup media in a stabilized normal environment.   5 years is the longest secured timespan of a device. Over those 5 years you automatically take the risk to loose your backup because you have no more warranty of your device.  That means that, for whatever technology you use: you must redo/convert your backup media every 5 years as your platform changes.  There is also another consideration to take that is almost more important than your storage: Where is the possible target of your restore plan? In a 10 years lifespan many of those devices are dead or evolved making your backup useless or at least make your restore plan a nightmare. That is why 5 years cycles are better because you can make live your data with the infrastructure evolution.
External device is per definition not secured...   In a computer it's practically saying that you'll use USB. And USB is not meant to be secure.  However you seem to have a very bad experience with internal ones which seems to be cheap ones and easily cheated.  You need to be sure that they use your veins or infrared. For having a little of security with the USB thing : be sure that it's not a device that only send "Yes/No".  Veins cannot be cheated by collecting the grease of the finger or a photo of the finger... Detection is thermal so an image cannot be presented.  The only way to cheat the detection is making a 3d metal sculpture of the structure of the vein of the good finger, heat it and show it to the system ... We can say that it's quite secure.  However the USB part make the device vulnerable to man in the middle attack (witch is noticed because have an hardware between the usb port and the usb cable) and is also vulnerable to any simulation of the device (this part you can fix it by applying all the methods against brute force method)  For instance: https://solisystems.com/fingervein/index.php?gclid=CM6CuaTjg8gCFUbmwgod5XgOcA
You can use iSCSI to connect your SATA drive over the network. AoE is faster but unsecure. Both technologies use an exclusive link and cannot be shared to more than one computer at a time.  Your Gigabit network is OK. However beware of cheap switches that handles a low number of packets per seconds.  Those are SAN technologies: you share a storage device over the network. That tech is the fastest one.  If you want to share to more than one computer at a time then you need a NAS technology. You share a "folder" which can be the root of your hard drive (c:\ under Windows or / under Unix). However it's a lot slower... like Windows file sharing.  Some NAS have both worlds inside them. For best performance you need a high quality one like Synology for your hard drive part.  On the other side: any modern PC can connect to it in any way possible: Windows XP onwards and recent Linux (and easily versions from 10 years ago).
I personally have the BenQ GL2440 since december 2010 and a GL2450 since august 2014. They are really good monitors, with a good price-performance ratio. I really like them, because they are not too expensive and show the collors pretty good.  Now BenQ has a newer version, the GL2460 which costs only 160â‚¬ currently on amazon Germany. Thus I would recomend buying the newer one. For 200â‚¬ you could also get the GL2760, which is basically the 27 inch version of the 2460.  I worked before with different sized monitors, and I think it's not really necessary to have same sized ones. The only plus of same size monitors is, that you can change the position of the windows, without thinking about window size.  I wouldn't recommend buying 2 monitors in your case (if you don't want to spend more then 200â‚¬), because for gaming across multiple monitors you need at least 3. In that case you would need same size monitors for the best experience.
If you've got a phone, this might work for you.    Moustache recommended, but sold separately.     The camera should be mountable either on a lightweight hat or strapped around the upper chest of a runner   Not sure if it's a hat... It looks more like a... Freaky headband used to brainwash people, and slow your fellow runners.     The price should be under $50 $75   $34.99 on sale for just $18. That's half off :)     The camera mounting system must be able to survive leaps, jumps, turns, etc. The runner with the camera may reach speeds of up to 12 miles per hour while running on trails with hilly terrain, so jostling will be an issue.   I haven't tested that, nor will I ever probably want too. But it's got a case!     A weight under half a pound   It's 90 grams. Is that less than a pound?        A 180 degree viewing angle   1080p resolution   A battery life of four hours      Mobile phone sold separately. Depends on what phone you've got, let's hope it has a fish eye :)
As I am pretty much in the same situation, here are what I look for:   SSD: since you'll likely perform many I/O on large data sets. 1 TB is my bottom line. RAM: since it's often more convenient and much faster to keep data sets (or part of it) in memory. 16 GB is really bottom line. GPU: Nvidia is sometimes preferable over AMD as it tends to be more supported (e.g. for neural network libraries). I had to get a MBP M2014 instead of M2015 because the latter had AMD while the former has Nvidia, and I need to use Theano.  OS: Linux tend to have more libraries (but since it doesn't have any decent speech engine software I personally use Microsoft Windows, using Linux in VM or in server). CPU: hasn't evolved much over the last few years... some i7 3rd or 4th generation is standard.   As it's often cheaper to add SSD and RAM oneself, I tend upgrade mid-spec laptops.  If price isn't an issue, you can have a look at those overpriced Alienwares. For people who are more budget conscious, just check to what extend the laptop is upgradable (e.g. max RAM + number of SSD slots). In the US, I like Xotic PC as the max specs are clearly defined.
I've recommended it previously, but I think it fits here too. I recommend the ASUS RT-AC66U.   It has 4 Ethernet ports (all 1GB/s) Mine covers a 2800+ sqft house from end to end, with it situated in the basement at one end.  It supports several different wireless security standards. Notably, it does NOT support WEP, which means you can't select that very insecure method.   Newegg lists the dimensions as: 207 x 148.8 x 35.5 mm (WxDxH) Supported by dd-wrt Price is currently $150. It's up to you to decide if that's cost effective.   Signal strength is one of the biggest reasons I upgraded to this router. Due to where the internet/cable box enters the house and how the cable is run, I was not able to bring it to a more central location. The opposite end of the house would not be covered under the previous router. This one covers everything. I've had no issues getting a signal anywhere since I purchased this device.
I recommend you the Mobius Action cam.       The camera should be mountable either on a lightweight hat or strapped around the upper chest of a runner   You can buy Magnet Mounting Clip for hats and the most basic package of the camera usually comes with a mounting sleeve with lots of options.     The price should be under $50 $75   It's around $70 on eBay and Banggood.     The camera mounting system must be able to survive leaps, jumps, turns, etc. The runner with the camera may reach speeds of up to 12 miles per hour while running on trails with hilly terrain, so jostling will be an issue.   I bought mine for cycling and I use it in the city and offroad as well without any issue with the velcro hooks on my helmet. I don't have any experience with another mounting systems but I guess usual head straps are good enough for a small and lightweight camera like this.     A weight under half a pound   It's only 37 gramms.     1080p resolution   It's supported, 30 fps.     A 180 degree viewing angle   I don't think that this is currently available in this price range. Mobius (with the new C lens) has 132 degrees.     A battery life of four hours   New versions comes with 820mAh battery which provides more than two hours of recording. I was able to record 140 minutes (1080p, 30fps) with my camera in the first few months. (I have not tested since then.) With a small power bank you can extend the battery life and it might be still below your weight limit.
The classic device for low-power Linux usage is the Raspberry Pi.  Either the model 1 B+ or the model 2 B will meet your needs: 4 USB ports, can run headless just fine, is about the size of a deck of cards, and draws about 3W.
As mentioned in the comments, some Android phones will come close, especially if you root/modify them afterwards.  There is an alternative that has not been mentioned, from the Mozilla organization: Firefox OS.  I have only used one of these phones briefly (for a couple of hours) personally, but I know others have used them successfully and enjoyed the open nature of the phone in particular.  There are a list of supported devices on the Mozilla site.  In terms of ethically manufactured and produced phones, I don't think you will have much luck with the current crop. I know of projects in the formation stage like FairPhone but I haven't seen anything in the wild yet.  I suspect that the people behind such an effort in terms of manufacturing and sourcing will give similar thought to the software that runs on the device, but the intersection of the two desires (fully open, fully ethical) is likely to be quite niche (for now).
Although I have chosen to take a look at Sennheiser Momentum In-Ear phones, I couldn't really buy it for a affordable price from my country.  So I've found the Philips SHE7050BK and it covers the requirements:   Good sound quality - Frequency response of 8Hz - 23kHz Reliability - To be tested  Strong cable - Flat anti-tangle cables Comfortability - Different ear caps for a perfect fit Extras:   Noise isolating ear caps Finely tuned 9mm drivers Rubberized cable relief Price range at $30
During my search for the reader, I have come across Barnes and Noble's Nook; which deserves a mention here, just in case anyone is looking for a budget e-book reader.  About Nook, in the words of Barnes and Nobles:     Our highest resolution E InkÂ® device helps you find your next read   faster and has a new GlowLight that more evenly illuminates the entire   page.   Features:   Memory: Holds a lot of books. So, memory isn't a problem. In fact, worrying about memory for any e-reader Weight: Lighter than the Kindle E-ink: Has Eink. And @belford has explained the advantages of an e-ink reader very nicely. Built in reading light: A wonderful feature for travellers. The reading light is gentle and perfectly aligns/blends with the pages, not making it too flashy.   About the back-light and the battery life:     With GlowLight on at the default brightness setting, a single charge   will last over 1 month with wireless off based on Â½ hour of daily   reading and 1 page refresh per minute. A single charge lasts over 2   months with wireless off and GlowLight off based on Â½ hour of daily   reading time and 1 page refresh per minute. Battery life depends on   device settings, usage, and many other factors.   Price: $99 and free shipping. So, it is cheaper than the Kindle.  There are a lot of reviews of Nook all over the internet, but as I trust Amazon Reviews, I am including the link.
A Raspberry Pi might be an option, esp. considering it's low power consumption, as well as low cost.  WebGL is somewhat experimental, but HTML or Java would work.   The Pi 2 has good specs ($35 gives you 1GB RAM and a quadcore CPU), and additionally it has a large community around it so many things are better documented and better supported. Additionally, Linux is very well supported and works well, in contrast to some other similar devices.  You will need to get a USB WiFi adapter as well as a (micro)SD card for storage.
For under $800 you can get some pretty insane video cards. Ever since the Nvidia GTX 900 series came out, manufacturers have been cramming as much as they can into every product (and that's a good thing).  EVGA GTX 980 Ti FTW (~$680)   Maxwell GPU architecture Supports 4 monitors (max digital resolution: 4096x2160) 6GB 384-bit GDDR5 PCIe 3.0 16x Clocks & cores: 1190MHz core, 1291MHz boost, 2816 CUDA Cores DVI-I, 3x DisplayPort, HDMI   This one will last for quite a long time considering its VRAM, clock speeds, and resolution support. It can play most PC games on very high or ultra settings.  I strongly recommend EVGA's Nvidia cards. These things are monsters and they're all backed by tons and tons of positive ratings. Great build quality, great support, great everything.    Workstation cards are made for rendering, but the problem there is that features are very restricted. For instance, the FirePro W7100 is a decent price and has more VRAM but it only outputs DisplayPort, has a smaller memory interface, and bandwidth is drastically lower. These are a few features that matter with non-workstations, and since you aren't sure if this will be used for rendering, the risk isn't worth it.
The Mediasonic Probox looks like a good option for you. It can be found here It has support for esata and usb 3.0. It has fairly good cooling with a thermal sensor to automatically change the fan speed. It has a power switch and can give you 6 gigabytes per second which is the maximum you are going to find in a sata 3 disk. It also has 4 bay enclosoures and it is not a rackmount solution.
Whilst most people I know have the ubiquitous  Fitbit, I have heard good things about the Microsoft Band. It is meant to have a few more features, although it is, unfortunately, lacking the Leaderboard community aspect. It is however compatible with Android, as is the Fitbit.  If money is no object, then why not go for an Apple Watch, whose features seem superlative? Although, I personally would wait for the Apple Watch 2, as the first version of anything generally has bugs that will be ironed out in the subsequent version. However, having said that it will not be compatible with your Android phone. Although, if money really is no object, you could always get an Apple phone as well.  You might want to take a look at Best Fitness Trackers 2015, from TomsGuide. They have come up with eight "top picks":   Fitbit Charge HR; Jawbone Up Move; Garmin Vivoactive; Withings ActivitÃ© Pop; Garmin Forerunner 225; Garmin Forerunner 15; Microsoft band, and finally; Moov.
OK, so I have used an older version of this product with success, but not had a chance to use their latest version.  My experience was good enough to make a general recommendation.  Icy Dock now offers a 4 disk enclosure, with lots of nice options (including adjustable fan speeds, dust filters, drive trays) called Black Vortex.    You need to have port-multiplier support to use the eSATA interface and that is limited to SATA II speeds (3 GB/s).  I should note that I used USB personally on the Icy Dock, and FireWire 800 on an Drobo rather than eSATA - my experiments with eSATA drives have been poor (might just be my bad luck).    On that point, you will only get one channel's worth of SATA II bandwidth (3GB/s) with this approach. That is significantly less than a well performing USB 3.0 interface, especially when you consider that a single channel SATA II is limited to ~300MB/s thanks to 8b/10b encoding.  USB 3.0 will likely outperform eSATA here, so worth considering.
Personally, I would go with a Mac here, but that is because it is what I am familiar with for development work.  I have been a Windows user since the 90s, and still have a Windows machine, but since 2004 (ish) I have used OS X for professional work (multiple Macbook Pros and Mac Minis) and have never regretted it once the initial adjustment period was over.  I will point something out that has not been mentioned, if you you pick a Macbook Pro you still have the option to legally use Windows in a VM (I have a Windows 10 VM on my MBP) or via Bootcamp.  If you pick a Windows laptop then you no longer have OS X as a (legal, non-hacky) option.  So, ignoring the cost aspect, the Macbook Pro leaves your options open in terms of what OS to use.  Generally, with the stated goal of learning Front End Development, I would recommend that you choose whatever represents the least impediment to your learning.  If you are most comfortable with Windows, then go with that, if you are more comfortable with OS X, then that should be your choice.    Now, with that said, this is a hardware recommendation site so I should tackle the question from that point of view rather than ease of use and the OS options.    First on my list, is build quality. There are some non-Apple models that approach the build quality of a Macbook Pro, but you will need to do some research - consistency between model refreshes can be a problem even for normally reliable brands.  I have used multiple models over multiple years from Apple and they are very, very consistent in this regard.  Perhaps even more telling: I have had 4 Macbook Pros provided for me by my employer, but for about 18 months that was not the case and I had to buy my own laptop.   I evaluated many, many options (several years previously I did the same thing and ended up with a Sony).  In the end, none of the models I evaluated could touch the Mac for build quality.  I purchased the MBP with my own money and can honestly say that I felt no regret at all, I felt I had gotten value - it's a good acid test for anything - when you fork over the money, do you feel ripped off or do you feel satisfaction with your purchase?  Second in my list comes the keyboard and trackpad.  Make sure you use the keyboard and trackpad in person, don't rely on reviews - it's too much of a personal preference in terms of tactile response, feedback etc. - only you know what laptop "feels right" when you are using it.  You are going to do a lot of typing on it, make sure it feels good.  Note: here is where I am mostly "locked in" to Mac laptops now - their keyboards and trackpads are how I expect things to work, anything that fails to hit those same notes just feels wrong.  Next, the screen.  The retina screen tech is very nice and the extra real estate helps if you aren't going to be plugging it into external monitors.  Yes, you can get non-Mac laptops to match the resolutions, but they won't come cheap.  I used to detest glossy screens, but the retinas are nice enough to convince me to give them a shot - so far, so good.  Finally, size and weight.  I am not a small person, and I find the 15" MBP to be the perfect trade off in terms of size versus functionality in a laptop.  I have tried out smaller laptops and found the keyboard and the screen too cramped.  Plus, they keep making it smaller and lighter - my 2015 MBP is a lot better than my 2009 in that regard (I no longer have my 2004 model to compare unfortunately).  That being said - you have to lug this thing around, so make sure you won't be looking enviously at people with 11" ultrabooks when doing so.  It might seem odd that I don't mention memory, CPU or disk.  I don't mention them because if you pick a recent model MBP it won't be a concern for the work you mentioned (maybe for Photoshop), and if you pick something else you will be looking to match or exceed those specifications in any case.  Just make sure you have an SSD - it's just not worth it not to these days.
I can second Kindle as an option (I have used an older model and a paper white) - for reading novels and other easily rendered text-only fare, it is a great product.  The ability to function in direct sunlight as well as darkness without destroying your eyes is a huge advantage over other options.  The Kindle app is available on other platforms too though (Android, iOS, desktop OS) and I have found it extremely useful to have a larger format, color capable reader for a couple of use cases:   Graphic Novels - if you like the format, then you will need more than e-ink Technical reading - diagrams, code samples, text that reacts poorly to being broken up all benefit from the larger format option   I have also used Kindle on my phone (it syncs to the furthest read location on multiple devices) for those times that you forget your reader/tablet or are unexpectedly bored.  Hence my recommendation, if you can afford it, is a multi-device approach for maximum satisfaction.  Whether you go with Kindle or not, make sure that your chosen app and format are usable with several types of devices (syncing is so useful too).    For travel, the phone is probably an easy choice (as long as your screen is reasonably sized).  The tablet is a personal call - you can replace it with a laptop, but I find that awkward in restricted space (planes, trains) - decent tablets can also be loaded up with films/games etc. for the times your onboard entertainment options are poor.  Personally, I leave the tablet at home for travel unless I know that I have a long flight where I need to do tech reading or I know the entertainment options are going to be horrible.
If you are willing to wait, you could get the Logitech Z333 Multimedia Speakers. As this hasn't been released yet, I can only go off of the spec sheet and online reviews, but this looks like it would fit your needs.  This is a 2.1 speaker system that costs $80 USD. The subwoofer is flat-bottomed, has its own independent controller, and has a 5 inch, front facing driver. The sub is rated at 23 Watts while the two satellites are rated at 8 Watts each. While the website doesn't say exactly how big the drivers are for the satellites, the width of the satellites is about 4.25 inches, so I would expect the drivers are in the range of 2.5 - 3.5 inches in diameter. There are four 5 foot cables for this system (plus input cables): one for the power (wall to sub), one for each satellite (sub to satellite), and one volume controller (controller to sub).  This system has both a 3.5 mm auxiliary input and stereo RCA inputs.   With about half of your budget left, you add a Bluetooth Audio Adapter for $40 that allows you to stream music from any Bluetooth enabled audio device. With both of these items, you are still below your $150 budget (excluding shipping).     UPDATE  This appears to have been released. If ordered from Logitech's website, you will get free standard shipping (4-7 business days) on this as the total cost is over $49.
I have two i7-4790 (3.6GHz) Intel processors. One is in a machine I use only for gaming and the other is in my development machine. Using the link that ArtOfCode provided, this processor currently (September 2015) sits in 6th for Single Thread Performance (behind the 4GHz version of the same processor and some Xeon chips).  Newegg lists the price as $310.  This processor has had no problems in new games (Arkham Knight...I was one of the lucky ones that had no issues), older games (Skyrim/Team Fortress 2) or family friendly games (any Lego game). On my development machine it performs like a champ as well.   I highly recommend this one (or the 4GHz one for $40 more).
The main problem with pocket-size projectors is that they mostly rely on wireless connection rather than typical interfaces. What is more, low resolution can make subtitles unreadable.   If we are talking about mini projectors, I can suggest ZeleSouris UC40.   Pros:   suit for home video playing relatively small (20.1 x 15.3 x 6.7 cm; 998 g) affordable price (~Â£60 on Amazon + free shipping) multi-function input (HDMI support) keystone correction many available reviews - check this one   Cons:   text display may be tiring for the eyes after a long time fan is quite noisy short power cable quality of the user manual   This review may be especially helpful:     Maybe just me, but this was a serious faff to get set up. Firstly, you   have to know how you are going to use this kit. I wanted to use my PC.   I thought USB to USB but no, that does not work. HDMI cable is the way   to go. Then once I got my hands on a cable, the picture was horrible!   Then I faffed about some more and found it is the picture ratio that   has to be just right. After all this, I get a decent picture. Better   user manual would be a good idea. I will probably do a youtube video   review/tutorial just to remind myself how to set this thing up.      I put a video onto a thumb stick and it played lovely. Hooked up an   external hard drive that played well too. I also used it to display my   ubuntu desktop. Text display is ok, but I would not like to have to   read alot with it. I have my curtains pulled slightly on a bright day   and it is plenty bright. One slight niggle is the power cable is very   short so you do need an extension lead. The projector does make fan   noise but I tend to mentally block it out once I'm watching a movie. I   would say it is as loud as or slightly louder than my PC. The lense   cover it came with does not stay on, in fact it is not the right cover   for this projector. No problem for me as I'm not travelling with it.   [...]      So to finish, if you have the money go for a high end model. But for   what I paid for this I am very happy.
I would recommend something in the GTX 900 series, or the R9 200 or 300 series.   If you want the most power possible, the R9 390 and the GTX 970 are both incredibly powerful cards, and just about equal in terms of performance. The only downside is they are just above your price range. (a quick search on google shopping shows most of them to be around 300-350) If you can find a good deal on one of these, that is probably your best option. It seems like the 390 is just slightly more powerful, but the 970 is more power-efficient. (I've also heard that the 970 has better overclocking, but I'm not positive on that.  If you're willing to sacrifice a little bit of performance to stay in your budget, your best option is probably the R9 290. (Which just so happens to be my current GPU) It is almost comparable to the GTX 970, but significantly cheaper. (You could probably get one for $250)
I'm going against the tide here: OS X. It can be easier to use for development stuff (especially web, can't vouch for .NET development and other such Microsoft technologies.), and it doesn't cost as much. Stop looking at me funny, there's data to come...  First, here's why I like OS X more:   It has a native UNIX terminal which, in my experience, in most cases works like a standard Linux command line in terms of built in commands (by which I mean most things I find on the Internet can be copy-pasted into my terminal and work fine with minimal modification).  You also have Homebrew, which allows you to easily install things that aren't bundled with OS X - think wget, htop, etc. Because it's UNIX-based, lots of things just work where you would have to fiddle with them in Windows. Also, OS X plays much nicer with Git-type tools, and really any collaboration. I can't count how many times I've had to revert a change from a Windows user that adds strange linebreaks.  These are all things that can be overcome with some tinkering... but it's still tinkering when you could be racking up billable hours. I personally like it better. Things make more sense, but that could be because I haven't used Windows as much as most people.   Now, the price argument: I would argue that OS X does not cost that much more than Windows. I know this is radical, but hear me out. Let's look at resale prices on Windows machines from 2010 - see this eBay search. That's for Windows laptops from 2010, five years ago.   I'm seeing ~$150-200 max unless you have an AlienWare laptop. AlienWare machines are really expensive and you probably won't be buying one for development work.  Now let's look at 2010 MacBook Pros. Outside of the for-parts machines (some of which still are selling for $300), I'm seeing $500 to $700. Even some for-parts MacBooks are selling for more than Windows laptops from the same year.  Note that some of these eBay links have expired, I didn't know eBay did that. I'll be trying to replace them with something firmer in the future.  Going through the first couple laptops on the Windows list:   Dell Latitude E6410 14.1" i7/ 500GB/4GB - sold for $147.50, original price from this period Engadget article was $1750, for the base model. Dell Latitude e6400 Core 2 Duo 2.24Ghz, RAM 4GB, HDD 250GB was from 2008, but sold for $89.99 with an original price of $1100 for the base model. Dell Latitude E4310 Intel Core i5 2.67GHz 2GB 160GB sold for $130 (only one bid), original price ~Â£1,400.00, which was around $2000 in 2010 USD Lenovo IdeaPad Y560P 15.6" Core i7/8GB Ram sold for $110 (18 bids), original price $2100 HP Mini 2140 10.1" Notebook Intel Atom 1.6ghz, 1GB Ram,160GB (from 2009) sold for $69.99, original price $630.  (Skipping for-parts MacBook Air that somehow got in that search) Dell Studio 1745 Laptop With JBL Premium Sound, 17.3" Screen, sold for $175, original price $779 (looks like it's from late 2009)   I could keep going, and you should to make an informed purchase decision, but doing this all manually is a lot of work. From those 6 most recently sold, there's an average drop of $1272 over the five years.  Now we look at the 2010 MacBook Pros. The first 6:   The first one sold for a "best offer price", and I have no idea what that means. Skipping... MacBook Pro 13" CUSTOM ORDER Laptop 2.66GHz-16GB RAM-1TB sold for $705.00, originally base model priced $1199, I'm going to add $500 to that since it looks like he's upgraded the RAM and such. So $1699 originally. He probably has less money into it. 15" MacBook Pro, sold for $400, originally $1799.  2010 Apple MacBook Pro 15.4" Core i5, MC372LL/A Laptop, 12GB RAM, 750 HDD, sold for $512, originally $1799. I'm going to give him another $400 for the RAM and HDD upgrades he made to the machine, so $2199. Apple MacBook Pro 15" 2.53GHz i5, 4GB, 500GB, sold for $790. Looks like a base model version of this, $1999. Apple MacBook Pro A1278 13.3" Laptop - MC374LL/A, sold for $700. Looks like it's a base model of this, $1199.  Apple Macbook Pro 13", 1TB Storage, 4GB RAM, 2.40GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, sold for $500. Looks like one of these ($1199) with a giant hard drive. I'll give him $300 for that hard drive, so $1499 originally.   Adding up those six, I get $1064 average loss over those five years. A couple notes on the data gathering:   I'd give a larger sample size if I thought it wouldn't make me go insane. If you want to do some research and add to the list, please do. I'll accept the edit.  Still, this is a phenomenon I've been observing for years. MacBooks simply hold their value better. I tried to be fairly generous with adding investments to the purchase price for people who upgraded their MacBooks. I didn't do that with Windows machines (didn't even take it into account, I always assumed the base model), and OS X still edged out Windows by a couple hundred dollars. Some of the Windows machines were from 2008/2009. I realize that, but I don't think it messed with the data that much. Resale prices on today's Windows machines may be higher in the future... but I don't think so. That's a decision you have to make.   Overall, the decision you have to make isn't about cost, but how much you want to invest in a machine. There is capital tied up in your laptop, and it's often more with OS X machines. That's a valid point against buying MacBooks.  Another thing: I was assuming you're buying your machine new. Don't do that. I have bought my MacBooks used off Craigslist - a 2009 13" Pro for $500 a few years back, and my current 2012 13" for $800 a few years ago. I could still get at least $500 out of it. Standard disclaimers apply, Craigslist is creepy. Bring a friend and meet in public.  If Craigslist is too creepy for you (don't blame you), buy a refurbished machine directly from Apple. They're better than a new machine and have 10-25% discounts. I've bought a MacBook Air, iPad, and an iPod Touch from there, and haven't had an issue with any of them.
Based on personal experience (3 out of 4 failed, purchased several months apart) I recommend to stay away from the hybrid drives, as I will be in the future.  A limited sample I know, I could have just been unlucky, but at this point I am cutting my losses with that tech.  I think with the cost of SSDs dropping, they will have a limited lifespan as a viable product in any case.    So far, I have not had an SSD fail (out of >10 purchased personally since 2009 in sizes from 75GB up to 512GB so far), though I have had one end up in a less performant state thanks to a faulty SATA cable.  I have owned dozens of HDDs and had a handful fail, but nothing approaching the failure rate I have seen in hybrids so far.  As of writing this, SSDs are coming in the $0.30 to $0.40 per GB range for sizes up to 500GB.   The interesting thing here is that (as an example, plucked from Newegg today) the cost for a 250GB SSD from Samsung is currently $0.40/GB which drops to $0.35/GB for the 500GB model.  At 1TB, that same drive comes in at $0.37/GB and it is on sale.  This is the kind of profile we are used to seeing, however.  Essentially, for the top end of any tech segment (4TB+ HDD, 1TB+ SSD at the moment) you will always pay a premium - same is true for CPU, memory, graphics, motherboards, displays etc.    This is generally how I will do my SSD shopping - pick a couple of manufacturers with good reputation (Intel, Samsung), then decide on your required level of SSD (budget, consumer, enterprise - in Samsung terms EVO, PRO, Enterprise).  Once you have that, look at the cost per GB for each size offered and look for the sweet spot - that will usually be one or two rungs below the top in terms of size.  Actually this method will work for most things - CPU (use to be cost per Ghz but more murky now), RAM (cost per GB too), Graphics cards (depends, but cost per FPS in a highend game I play is how I do it), HDDs (cost per GB).  There is always a sweet spot on the curve, and it will usually be a little below the bleeding edge, and frequently have sales on (so watch for them).  I see from follow up comments that you are looking at HDDs because of price, so let's see where the sweetspot lines up for those.    Edit: Updating analysis for 2.5" drives thanks to comments  Looking at 2.5" drives that would give you a little bit of a speed boost (7200 rpm) and not worrying about the interface (the PS4 is limited to SATA II) one thing that was immediately obvious is that there is not a lot of choice, here is the cost per GB of a selection of Seagate 2.5" 7200 RPM drives:   $0.188/GB - 1TB $0.186/GB - 750GB  $0.129/GB - 500GB   That 500GB model was actually cheaper than the smaller drives, so hardly a surprise that they are the default for the PS4.  It's worth noting that the SSD 1TB prices are "only" 2x the 7200 RPM hard drives in the 2.5" form factor, so it's not as much of a premium as compared to 3.5" drives (see below).  Here is my original comparison, where I mistakenly profiled 3.5" drives.  It's illustrative, so I will leave it here for reference:  I will pick a single brand that I have good experience with (Seagate), go for 7200 rpm drives, and not pay too much attention to other factors (warranty, cache etc.) since this is a rough estimation:   $0.092 per GB - 500GB $0.049 per GB - 1TB $0.0375 per GB - 2TB $0.03 per GB - 3TB $0.038 per GB - 5TB   The particular model I was looking at for convenience did not have 4TB/6TB sizes listed, but you get the idea - it looks like 3TB or 4TB is your likely sweet spot from a cost per GB perspective (as an aside: about one tenth of the SSD prices above), so I would look for well reviewed, reliable drives in that range and buy with confidence (for now).  Just for reference, the 8TB 7200 RPM drives are rare and are coming in at ~$0.7 per GB as of writing this answer.
I tend to splurge a bit on NAS type components (Drobo, Icy Box) so I can't make a personal recommendation when it comes to the cheaper end of the scale, but I can make a general recommendation when it comes to buying the drives you are going to populate your chosen NAS with: don't buy them from the same place.  Do buy the same model, from the same manufacturer, for RAID purposes. But always try to source each drive from a different place (one from Amazon, one from Newegg for example) even if you have to pay a small premium to do so.  Why? Well, when manufacturing defects occur they tend to occur in batches (get detected, potentially fixed in a later batch).  If you get all your drives from the same batch (which is more likely when you order 2 from one place) you may end up with the same flaw in both drives.    That then leads to the "when will my drive fail?" question - if you get different batches you will get slightly different MTBF rates so that unless you are massively unlucky you won't have 2 drives fail at the same time (hopefully giving you time to replace and repair your RAID array in the event of a drive failure).  You can also achieve this by staggering your drive purchases by a few weeks (though be careful of warranty coverage differences), but usually it is relatively easy to find two sellers with similar pricing for a particular model.
I have been using the dual version of the Allcam monitor bracket for a few years now, and I love it - no problems with 2 x 24" flat screens.  The height is a little tricky to adjust but the mobility is good horizontally and tilt is available without an issue.  It supports 3 screens and beyond (it is modular).    It is a desk mounted bracket and it supports weights in excess of 13lbs, so it seems to fit your requirements.    The invoice I dug up tells me that in 2011 I ordered the following from Allcam directly:   2 x Long Arm for Allcam MDM0X series LCD Monitor Desk Mount Bracket 1 x MDM05 Multi Screen Desk Mount Bracket   That came to a total of just over â‚¬100 thanks to high taxes and delivery charges to Ireland, but still not excessive.  You would need 2 of the long arms, one short and MDM06 instead, but it's pretty modular, so it's really up to you.  Here's a link to the Amazon (UK) version of the MDM06 with decent pictures and an idea of price - I would have used Amazon when I ordered but it was not an option.  I have moved twice since I ordered and had to disassemble and reassemble each time - it's a little tricky if space is tight or you have a tight fit with a wall (but you mention you don't) - but otherwise it is solid, and I have never had any concerns about stability.  While searching for a decent shot of the triple set up I spotted that Allcam have a guide up on Youtube showing you how to set up the triple monitor here so you can get a decent idea of what's involved and how it might look.  As an aside: this was one of the best quality of life things I ever did - I highly recommend it if you can manage the fitting and your desk will hold up - it frees up an insane amount of space.
In doing some quick research it would appear that on several DVD players it is possible to make it region free. That would open up your options drastically. However, if you want to go with an easier approach. There are a number of them that are for sale on amazon. You should be able to search for "region free dvd player" and get good results.   Here is one by phillips that appears to meet most of your needs.  From all that I am able to find, there is no DVD player that will allow you to skip through the content that is not meant to be skipped through (anti-piracy, FBI Warning, etc.). If you truly need that experience, your best bet might be to do an HTPC. This will cost quite a bit more potentially, but will allow for what you are asking.  If you get a region free dvd player like the Phillips one it will have upscaling and should remember where you left off. There are some shortcut button combinations to allow DVD items to be skipped, though they may not provide that much benefit.
Lenovo IdeaPad Y50-70-59441231 meets your requirements. A comprehensive review can be found here. I am talking about model with GTX 960M. Price: 1499 Euro.  According to your spec:   NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M has 4096 MB GDDR5 memory - the same memory bandwidth as the previous GTX 860M, it has higher core clock and it leads to a slightly better performance. 960M is almost 10 percent faster and similar to the desktop GTX 750 Ti. Many games of 2014/2015 can be played fluently in FullHD resolution and high detail settings. Memory: up to 16 GB DDR3-1600, dual-channel, two memory banks http://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-960M.138006.0.html Samsung SSD PM851 512 GB MZ7TE512HMHP, 512 GB. It is less than desired, but it can be easily replaced. Take the price into account - SSD are much more expensive.  Display: 15.6 inch 16:9, 3840x2160 pixel, Samsung L FLLTN156FL02L01, IPS (glossy) There are three USB ports on this notebook, whereas two of them are USB 3.0 ports (Source) Numpad: Yes Backlight: Yes.      The side shafts of the island-style keys are made of translucent red   plastic, and the light shines through the actual key bodies, rather   than simply leaking from around the key cutouts, as in other backlit   laptops. Source.   Gaming Performance      Lenovo's Y50 is explicitly aimed at gamers. Thus,   it is not surprising that it can render all current games smoothly. It   is normally possible to select the Full HD resolution and high to very   high quality settings. The resolution and/or quality level has to be   reduced in some games, for example "The Witcher 3". The frame rates   are only slightly higher than that of laptops equipped with a GeForce   GTX 860M graphics core. However, the advantage over 860 models of the   Y50 is greater, like in the 3DMark benchmarks, because the GeForce GTX   860M GPUs in the Y50 models do not clock at their maximum possible   speeds.      The screen's maximum resolution (3840 x 2160 pixels) can only be fully   utilized in rare cases. This option is at most possible in games that   only have moderate hardware requirements. The Y50 only achieves just   below 70 fps in the benchmark of the game "Dirt Rally" in very low   quality settings. The rates drop to 25.3 fps in medium and 22.8 fps in   high settings. Source.

Think about Logitech G105. Price: $39.99 .  According to your spec:   6 programmable G-keys: Configure up to 18 unique functions per game, including single key presses, complex macros or intricate Lua scripts* (*Requires software installation) Long-life blue LED backlighting (Two different brightness levels plus Off) Quick-access media controls: volume, mute, start, stop, pause, forward and back functions. It works with Windows 8 and you don't have to care about W10 compatibility. It's more about marketing rather than specific adjustment. Game/desktop switch: Disables the Windows/Context Menu keys to prevent accidental game interruptions It's a full-size keyboard and seems to be solid     If you want to have an extra USB think about Logitech G710+  The nice thing about G710+ is cable routing underneath the keyboard:   Check also:  Logitech G710+ Mechanical Gaming Keyboard Unboxing & First Look Linus Tech Tips
Note/Update: thanks to comments I now realize that I missed the 16:9 requirement - the below basically applies to a 16:10 monitor.  If that is not an issue for you (I have used both and do not really notice a difference), then read on....  When time came to replace my venerable Iiyama E511S in 2013 (after ~9 years of service) I did a lot of research - I wanted something in the 24" range, widescreen, with crisp text and a decent response rate and I didn't want to get ripped off in terms of price, but wanted an IPS panel.  In the end, after reading a lot of reviews I went with the Dell Ultrasharp U2412M, and the best price I found was on Amazon (not Dell direct).    At the time it cost me ~â‚¬300 but it can be had for around the â‚¬250 mark now.  I know that is a little above your stated price target but that's largely thanks to the crappy Euro exchange rates.  It is sub 200 pound sterling on Amazon UK at the moment and less than $250 in the states, so you may be able to source it a bit cheaper than â‚¬250.  I have this right next to a BenQ G2400W as a second screen and the difference is noticeable, particularly when reading text (much crisper, less tiring on the eyes) or playing something hi-res.  For SD or DVD quality video the BenQ is fine, but 1080P or hi-res games are much, much better on the Dell.  I have been so happy with it that I even wrote a review of my purchase on Amazon, something I rarely do.  One note where this misses your stated requirements: this has DisplayPort and DVI rather than HDMI - was not a concern for me (did not need sound, already had an adapter)
I recommend Siva Cycle's "The Atom".     This product mounts to the rear wheel. Siva has good instructions on how to install it.    Using this, it can charge constantly via USB. I use it to charge my HTC M8 while using it's GPS features. It also has a battery pack, which you can use for power while away from your bicycle.  One very important note: This does not work with disk brakes. You indicated that you have rim brakes. This means you won't have a problem with your current bicycle. It is something to remember, though, when you replace the bicycle.   Siva has the product for sale at $130. Amazon has the same price. It is weather resistant to IP-4 standards. This protects you against splashing water.   I have not noticed any slow down while using this. Installation took me about 5 minutes.
The Globalsat ND100 seems to be what you're looking for.  It's a bit bulky, but it seems to do everything you need it to do.   It's only $35USD Has a thumb-drive-like form factor (Besides it being a bit bulkier than a thumb-drive) It states to have "Very low power consumption" According to this article, any GPS  receiver that advertises NMEA-0183 compliance will work with GPSD; which this receiver does. So it should be compatible (Though I never tested it)   Edit: Looks like this actually uses Micro-USB, not standard USB. But a simple adapter should work (And still be well under your budget)
It doesn't look like theres a consumer version out yet, but Sony SmartEyeglass looks promising.    Has a better design than Google Glass (In my opinion) Has a SDK (Can't comment on whether it's "good" or not, as I never used it) Built-in 3MP camera Not 100% sure about integration with mobile apps, but it does say that it supports devices running Android 4.4 and above
If you're willing to go for a little bit larger screen and no official support for Cyanogen, then you might like the Dell Venue 10 7000 ($499). It has:   10.5" screen (a bit larger than you wanted, but not by too much) Support for Android Lollipop 5.0 Good speakers, better than most Android tablets MicroSD card reader Optional magnetically attachable keyboard, which is also a stand (not included, but can be bought for an additional $160) Carrying case (not included, but can be bought for $20) (not a stand)
tl;dr: arm swing is noise compared to accuracy of GPS       Is there a GPS watch that somehow accounts for this to produce more accurate data?   No, there is not.  The reason is among others that to get that level of accuracy for GPS requires significantly more than the GPS locator can provide.     The U.S. government is committed to providing GPS to the civilian community at the performance levels specified in the GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS) Performance Standard. For example, the GPS signal in space will provide a "worst case" pseudorange accuracy of 7.8 meters at a 95% confidence level. (This is not the same as user accuracy; pseudorange is the distance from a GPS satellite to a receiver.)   It is possible the military, who are allowed multiple GPS channels could account for the noise associated with civilian GPS and create a watch this accurate. They may in fact have one. Probably not one you can purchase, however..  Note that for applications that do need this level of accuracy such as farming or surveying all have some level of supplemental signal (such as RTK). These tools are all several orders of magnitude more than your $90 requirement - most are $1000-$10000 price range. They are also bulky and not likely to be portable. Many still have accuracy that is only in the ~10 inch range, too. If your arm swing is 2 feet their error is still nearly 50% of what you are wanting to account for.  Also observe that not all running watches are created equally. I would suggest looking at this and picking one which has the best criteria.  Now, onto my next point, which is instantaneous pace.     The pace should be accurate to the second - I've noticed that my current watch only does this in multiples of five seconds (e.g. it will rounds 7:03 up to 7:05).   First, keep in mind how pace is calculated.   It is almost assuredly not polling the GPS signal multiple times every second and calculating instantaneous updates every quarter second (or whatever). Because GPS is a battery hog to get lightweight devices it likely is polling at an interval. A friend of mine with a PhD in networking technology indicated that once/second with a GPS intensive app is probably a good rule of thumb. More kills battery life.  So lets say you are running a 7 minute mile.  That's about 10 feet per second. Let's generously say that the accuracy of the GPS error is only +/- 3 meters (remember, 7.9 meters is the published accuracy at 95% confidence). This is a pretty significant improvement - a 7.9 meter circle vs a 3 meter circle. 3 meters is about 10 feet, and so this means that any calculation looks like:   10 real feet traveled +/- 10 feet = 0-20 feet GPS traveled, in 1 second   So clearly a 1-second pace doesn't make sense from a GPS perspective. Let's look at 5 feet:   50 real feet traveled +/- 10 feet = 40-60 feet GPS traveled   Ok, this is better, but still not super accurate, even with a 5 second polling interval. Keep in mind this is assuming that the GPS accuracy is pretty good that meaningful and repeatable.  Let's also consider your arm swing. At worst, your arm swing might be 2 feet linear distance - out of 40-50 feet traveled in the 5 second interval. This is a small error margin, perhaps 2/40 or about 5% maximum error. But the GPS error is still 25% of this scenario.  If we consider the 1 second poll, the GPS error is 100% and arm swing is still only 25%.
Disclaimer: I do not own the following product.  I have found the Dell XPS Ultrabook (Amazon link) that looks like it would fit your needs.  It has a 15.6" touchscreen with a resolution of 3200x1800 pixels. It has a 512GB SSD and 16GB RAM with 2GB GDDR5 RAM dedicated to the Nvidia GeForce GT 750M graphics card. Its battery is rated to last around 11 hours. The laptop weighs in at around 4 pounds. Since this is an Ultrabook, the build quality is going to be top of the line. The keyboard is also backlit. The cost of this device retails at $2,250 on Newegg and $2,300 on Amazon. Currently, you can get it at $2,138 on Newegg and $1,815 on Amazon. (All prices USD).  Since I do not own the device, I do not know some of the details about this device. While the battery is rated at 11 hours of use, a reviewer on Amazon said they were lucky to get 3 hours out of it. I also do not know if the body of the laptop is metal or plastic. The color is Silver Anodized Aluminum, but that doesn't tell you much. I also do not know how the trackpad compares to your MacBook.
I have a BlinkStick Square. They have a large variety of products (including an enclosure for my Square that I just noticed).     The Square has 8 LEDs and each are addressable individually. The Square comes pre-assembled. There are other products that provide you with the parts so that you can build it.   The API supports a number of languages (including Python and Ruby). You can also control it remotely by connecting to the BlinkStick web service.
A general rule of thumb is that a 100% increase in memory speed corresponds to a 5% increase in overall performance.  This is because memory access is slow relative to the CPU, so CPUs and programs are designed to minimize memory access.  My experience with POV-Ray bears this out: overclocking the RAM/FSB of my computer from 266 MHz to 333 MHz resulted in benchmarks taking about 1% less time -- though as you can probably tell from the memory speeds involved, this was ten years ago.
Asus UX501 is a solid 15" laptop that can be compared with Macbook Pro retina 15".        Specs:   15.6 inch, 3840 x 2160 px resolution, IGZO IPS, touchscreen Intel Haswell Core i7-4720HQ CPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M 4GB GDDR5 16 GB DDR3 (8 GB soldered, 1 x 8 GB DIMM) 512 GB PCIe SSD (M.2 PCIe 80 mm)   I'm not sure about the trackpad quality, but it does come with an aluminium case and backlit keyboard.  The Zenbook UX501 is available in the US for $1499.
SDDs are quite conspicuous when it comes to quality and performance. Capacity, read/write times are made very clear so you can buy what you need. Any further optimisation will come down to your OS, and they're usually pretty good. 250 GB is more than I need for programming but if you think you need that then go for it. Depending on the size of the project, read write times are usually less of an issue since your OS will cache it anyway. This prevents constant read writes to your SSD and makes use of faster cache storage eg. RAM. If your project size is larger than the capacity of RAM your OS is dedicating to your project then it can become important. However if you're constantly recompiling entire large projects, you probably don't need to be and should adapt your programming environment.  Both of those SDDs offer 535MB MB/s write and 540MB/s / 370MB/s read which is more than you're asking for.
With these fairly low requirements, any of the mid-range ARM boards would fit, so you might as well go for a Raspberry Pi by default. (Model 2, the earlier models aren't worth the slightly lower price.) The reference price for just the board is $35, plus a power supply gets you    4 USB2 ports (keyboard, mouse, external drive, 1 spare or wifi) 100Â MB Ethernet â€”Â on the USB bus, so not ideal for heavy duty storage server, but ok for downloading stuff over a typical home Internet connection. Jack and HDMI audio output. Lower power consumption than the external hard disk.   The CPU is not nearly as fast as the latest Intel offering, obviously, but it's enough to run ordinary Ruby programs and do C compilations. (I wouldn't do big C++ or Java compilations though, but more than the CPU, the limiting factor is that there's only 1Â GB of RAM).  Since this is well under budget, you might consider a higher-end ARM board. 64-bit ARM boards (ARMv8) within your budget are starting to appear. (Of course, that's if you want 64-bit for some reason, not if you specifically need x86_64.) There's at least HiKey board is attempting to be a reference 64-bit board. It has a 1.2Â GHz Cortex-A53, built-in USB2 and wifi, HDMI, 4Â GB of onboard flash memory. There's also the cheaper Dragonboard 410C, with 8Â GB of onboard flash, 4 USB ports and wifi. Unfortunately both have only 1Â GB of RAM, at which point there are few benefits 64-bit CPU (there can still be benefits from other architectural improvements such as extra registers and cryptographic accelerators). I can't seem to find an affordable 64-bit board with 2Â GB or 4Â GB of RAM. You may want to start out with a 32-bit, 1Â GB board now and use the rest of the price for a 64-bit board in a year or so if you find the need.
An alternative which you should consider is moving to a server-client model for your calculations, performing the calculations on a powerful desktop and accessing the results remotely.   The desktop, being relatively free from the restrictions of cooling and weight, can be configured to be almost an order of magnitude more powerful than the best laptop. Dual Xeon setups with 3 or 4 graphics cards come to mind.   However, in order for remote access to work well, you need to have a reliable internet connection (data or wifi). If you can obtain a high speed internet connection that you can reliably access from any of the places you frequent, you should seriously consider that as an option.   Many 3G/4G operators have data plans which you can use in your laptop either as a built-in or using a USB data modem, and the main stumbling block here is likely to be the coverage of their services.
I'll recommend my laptop: an Acer Aspire E1-572. There are multiple sub-models of this model, with slightly different specs (other processors, etc), but I'll list what mine has:        Intel Core i3-4010U @ 1.7GHz   Intel HD Graphics 4400, ~2GB DVM   15.6" HD LED LCD   8GB DDR3 L RAM   1TB HDD      There's another model that will allow you to upgrade the processor to an i7. Now, your requirements:   Gaming - I use mine to play similar games. It won't stand massively graphics-intensive stuff, but vanilla Minecraft runs at a steady 60fps (Java on max 4GB RAM) Video Editing - can't say I've done a lot of it. Should hold up to get what you need to do done, though - but I probably wouldn't try to do heavy stuff. Surfing - haven't yet found a limit to the number of tabs I can have open and not lag. Speed - 1.7 GHz CPU is OK - if you're compiling stuff like big Java programs it's a little slow, but holds up and does at least do the job. 8 GB RAM is plenty for almost all tasks, too. Looks - follow the link, look at the shiny picture. Also comes in other colours - mine's red. Screen - 15.6" is a little over your requirement, but I carry mine around to school comfortably in a backpack. 1366 x 768. OS - Windows 8.1 by default. I had no problems at all upgrading that to Win X. Price - here's where it falls a little. 400 CAN$ is a tight budget. Mine came new for Â£300 (CAN $600), though you can get a used version online for more like Â£200 (CAN $400), which is a little better for you.
I had a similar set of requirements for a media center box in terms of Bluetooth, WiFi, fanless (and I also wanted IR built-in). I have bought and used the Cubox i series by Solid Run, specifically the i4 Pro personally.  It has been a great little box and performs admirably in terms of rendering video at full HD, the IR works perfectly with my remote and the WiFi worked out of the box with several OS options that I tried (settled on openELEC for my needs).    I will say that I have since switched to wired for better video performance, but I believe that is likely down to poor signal quality to the unit in its current location (which is poor relative to my router).  Other than that this has been running for over a year in its current configuration without an issue.  You can get a decent amount of local storage via the micro SD card, it has HDMI-out for the display, and it will easily come in under your suggested budget.  These systems are also available as bare board SOMs, so you could potentially go that route to get a customised fit for your environment too.  The one thing I can't speak to at present is the latency for displaying the webcam footage.  I use the camera built into my laptop, and do not have a separate unit so I can't easily test using your suggested methodology.
I recommend Corsair's AX760     Has the connectors specified (24 pin ATX and 8 pin CPU) 80 Plus Platinum certification Standard size 760 watts (if you feel that's to close to the estimated 600W pointed out in the comments, you can upgrade to the 860W for $20 more) Cost: $150 (on sale); $200 (full price) It is fully modular Not only does it have a dedicated fan...it's quiet 7 year warranty   My newest machine has this power supply. I've had no problems with it at all and been very pleased with performance. I use it to power very similar hardware to what you've already picked out (including the multiple drives and combination of HDD and SSDs). I selected it because of the good reviews I'd seen, including an Editor's Choice award from TechPowerUp     To sum up, the AX760 is a no brainer if you don't want many bells and whistles (aka digital control), but do want the best that money can buy in this category. You will invest a serious amount of money, that is for sure, but you will enjoy Corsair's support for seven years while your system is being fed by ultra-clean and stable DC outputs.
I'm with Andy on the Corsair PSUs. They're always the best quality on the market and they come with great price tags. I'll recommend something a little different though: the Corsair HX850i is part of the HX gaming series and is built for high performance with low noise output.  Specifications:   840 Watts &ndash; more than enough room for extra graphics cards or overclocking 20+4-pin power (effectively 24 total) Haswell support fully modular 92% efficiency &ndash; amazing performance for gaming over power/under voltage/over temp/short circuit protection Corsair Link to adjust rail voltages (fan speeds) ZeroRPM mode that turns the fan off when there's little to no load 140mm fluid dynamic fan   The warranty on Corsair products is much, much longer than anything else you'll find, however it still doesn't cover the entire lifespan of the PSU because they last so dang long. I highly recommend this.
An Update:  This monitor has a D-Sub input. In this case you just need a VGA-VGA cable. VGA supports 1080p as it is - you won't notice any difference since the cable is of good quality.      As far as I know it it can only recognize either VGA or HDMI. Check this topic. The best thing you can do is to ask on HP forums about drivers - it would be better to do it before making a purchase. Check this part from the linked topic.      I discovered that if you run the install of the Intel HD Graphics 4000   driver version 10.18.010.3464 it will initialize both the VGA and the   HDMI and they will both work until you reboot your machine.    VGA supports 1080p. The quality of the signal begins to drop off above 1920x1080. Is it worth to buy a good quality cable. Similar question on SuperUser. The adapter may be unnecessary if you find appropriate drivers.
I personally use the Plugable UD-3900 USB 3.0 Universal Docking Station, I find it convenient if you have many devices to connect to your laptop. Regarding the graphics:   HDMI port supports resolutions up to 2560x1440* and DVI/VGA port supports display resolutions up to 2048x1152 / 1920x1200; wired Ethernet port supports 10/100/1000Mbps speeds Full support for Windows 10, 8.1, 8, 7, & legacy XP systems. Surface RT, Mac OS X, and Linux/Unix are not supported. Docking station suggested for use with web and productivity software; not recommended for gaming *2560x1440 output only available when using a single HDMI display. If dual displays are connected, each will be limited to a maximum resolution of 1920x1200. 2560x1440 output requires a "High Speed" HDMI cable. 2560x1440 mode operates at a 50Hz refresh rate; all lower modes support 60Hz refresh. 2560x1440 output requires current DisplayLink drivers and attached monitor must natively support 2560x1440 via HDMI input
PSU recommendations are tough because it is a fairly quickly shifting market (not as bad as some, but nonetheless).  I have personally had good experiences with several Corsair models, Enermax, EVGA and a couple of others over the years, so how do you go about picking one again?  My lazy default is probably Corsair, but that is covered in other answers, and I occasionally want to look at other options and do my homework rather than assume that it is still the best choice.  When doing so, I first check out a Power Supply calculator like this one to make sure I am beating my minimum required wattage by at least 20% - this gives me wiggle room should I need to add devices, or up the graphics card later, it also means that I am not over stressing the PSU even at full load.  Next, I will decide if I really want modular or not, because there is usually a bit of a premium there in terms of price.  Then I will filter down to the ones on the list with the best efficiency rating within my wattage and budget range.  This is all a little theoretical, so let's walk through it with actual numbers.  I guessed at a couple of things with your specs as a guideline and came up with a wattage requirement of 580W.  Using my 20% rule above that rounds up to 700W as a minimum and I'll use 800W as a max to keep the resulting list smaller.  Next, I plugged those requirements (along with the platinum 80 plus and modular requirement) into Newegg and got a list of just 8 candidates.    What I am hoping for now is for one (or more) of those candidates to be from brands I know.  If so, then I just do some basic due diligence by reading a couple of reviews, and make my choice.  In this case my results give me two such options:   Corsair AX760 EVGA SuperNova 750 P2   Without a major price difference I would go for the Corsair, but the reviews on the EVGA look good, I've had decent experience with EVGA previously, and right now it is coming in at $40 cheaper than the 760 ($109 vs $149 after rebate) because it is on sale.  That's enough for me, if I was buying the PSU right now, it would be the EVGA.  Without the sale I would plump for the Corsair.
As @ArtOfCode said in a comment, there aren't many mice out there that can connect directly to a device without a receiver. This is because most wireless components (Bluetooth or otherwise) are designed using their own special frequencies, encodings, or some other aspect that, when altered, can restrict freely connecting to any device. Most companies do this as a simple marketing technique.  Now for a recommendation. As always, good ol' Logitech has a product for anything you need. The M557 Bluetooth Mouse (~$40 USD) will hopefully suit you well:   Bluetooth wireless &ndash; no receiver needed to connect to any device 12-month battery life (kind of vague because everyone uses their mouse differently, still amazing though) Logitech software allows you to customize the function of each button 1000 dpi for accurate clicks Scroll wheel can scroll side-to-side Comfortable design &ndash; not nearly as slim as the Magic Mouse, but the shape is similar (see below)
I would go with the ASUS laptop. It supports more memory, which allows you to have more programs open, and believe me, Adobe is horrible about memory management. While the graphics card is better in the ASUS, it doesn't really matter unless you are going to game or do 3D renders with it. According to the spec sheets from the links you gave me, they both use the same processor (the Intel Coreâ„¢ i7-4710HQ processor).   When you are buying a new computer, focus on the things that you cannot fix, things like the processor, graphics, and max RAM. Things you can fix shouldn't count against it as heavily. While the ASUS might have bad audio, you can use headphones or other external speakers. If it doesn't support the memory cards that you want, you can get a USB card reader. The MSI laptop on the other hand doesn't have a CD drive, but as you said, you can get an external one. However, you cannot add more then 16GB of RAM if you need more.   The main difference between these laptops is the RAM, which is arguably the most important competent for graphic designers. That is why I recommend you go with the ASUS laptop.
Maybe two of FiiO-E6? A few dollars over your budget (for two). I have not used them myself, but are recommended reviewed on http://lifehacker.com/five-best-portable-headphone-amplifiers-1722800379  Response to comment: well, they meet your requirements of being    pocket-sized: "1.6 x 0.4 x 1.6 inches ; 0.6 ounces" battery powered: "1 Lithium ion batteries required. (included) [...] Built-in rechargeable battery provides up to 10 hours of normal use. Mini USB charger port can be used with any USB power source."   As for "standard headphone jack input", I'm guessing you want 3.5mm jack. The Amazon page fails to say the jack size, but in this video review you can see it's a 3.5mm jack.  Since you're using two devices, these following requirements    at least 2 standard headphone outputs, preferably 3 separate volume control for each output   are trivially met (2 outputs).  As for price, "$27.99 & FREE Shipping on orders over $35" at Amazon. So if you buy two right now... $56 shipped. (Since you already have one amp, you could just keep that and buy just one other single-output amp [this or another], saving some dough.)  People say (in those reviews) that reliability of FiiO products is mediocre though. The most geeky/in-depth review of it you can find is probably the one by NwAvGuy. His review can probably summarized by quoting this bit:     The E6 is not an especially clean or well behaved amplifier but in light of the very modest $30 price itâ€™s likely acceptable for many applications for those on a budget.    Here comes the stuff you probably don't care about. The opamp (i.e. the chip that determines sound quality) inside this FiiO E6 is an AD8692 ($0.60 list price in 1K quantities). Most the parts cost goes into making this thing run a Li battery. The opamp is a surface mount (SMT) part, so you have to be pretty adept to replace it with something better in your garage, but some have pulled it off without professional SMT equipment.
Asus Xonar DX 7.1 is on sale at Newegg for $75+ $4 shipping - $10MIR = $69.   PCIe x1 interface? Yes. at least 5.1 channels? 7.1 24-bit audio output? Yes at least 96KHz sample rate? 192KHz high SNR (at least 108dB)? claims 116dB   Response: No, I don't have first hand experience with this card, but I do with another Asus (external) sound product, Xonar U7, that's ok. This was the only card that I found meets both your noise level and price requirements. If you relax the noise level a bit, you get much cheaper stuff, for example:  Creative Sound Blaster Audigy FX 5.1 PCIe Sound Card with 600 ohm Headphone Amp   PCIe x1 interface? Yes. at least 5.1 channels? 5.1 24-bit audio output? Yes at least 96KHz sample rate? 192KHz high SNR (at least 108dB)? claims 106dB $32.99 + free shipping   In case you wonder, the "600 ohm Headphone Amp" means it has a separate, relatively powerful headphone amplifier onboard, which can drive "difficult" (that is high-impedance) headphone like Sennheiser HD600 (which cost about 10x what this card does, so it's a bit questionable that you'd want this cheap card for those). This feature doesn't affect/matter for the 5.1 speakers output.  And since you're probably going to ask... no I don't first-hand experience with this card either. The last Creative (proper) card I had was an Audigy 2 (PCI); quality was as advertised. I also have an E-MU 1212M, which is their professional brand basically; outside your price range by a factor of at least 2 and not 5.1 etc.
You need a small dongle that adds Bluetooth capability to your computer. I recommend something small like the AZiO Micro Bluetooth Adapter. This device is under $15 on Newegg.    This device plugs into a USB port and enables Bluetooth communications with various devices via Bluetooth (speakers, printers, keyboards/mice, phones, and more).  After installation of the drivers, you will perform standard Bluetooth device pairing to get your speakers to communicate with the newly enabled dongle.
Unless you go for the "ghetto cooling" option you are not likely to find any after-market cooling options for a lower end card like the 430.  This one supports the 440 but does not list the 430 and I suspect it would not be an improvement in terms of freeing up the neighboring slot.  Do you have any other full size PCI-E slots available (x4 or x8)? If so, your x1 card will work in that slot without any modification and that may solve your issues from a slot perspective.  You could then look for a replacement heatsink from a second hand or broken card to replace the one that has been modified.
Your best bet is likely to be to get either a smartphone with interchangeable batteries and carry multiple ones, or get an external power pack.   A limited sample size survey of a number of smartphones show that for web browsing, the best performer (iPhone 6) drained 35% battery in 150 minutes, which implies a 7.5 hour battery life for web browsing over WiFi. Since data using the cellular radio consumes more battery life than WiFi, it would likely have even lower battery life (which matches the 5 hours you are getting on a full charge). Therefore, it is highly unlikely any existing smartphone has >24h of battery life on mobile data.   A power pack such as this one can provide enough power for continuous web usage. Assuming the same iPhone 6, the 16000mAh model can provide power for over 30 hours straight, or you can reduce the capacity if you want to carry less battery weight around. The battery pack weighs around ~400g on its own, and would not fit inside an average pocket, but if you are on the go (eg on a train/bus without a power socket, or on a bicycle), it would be a good idea.
First of all, it would not be easy to find a monitor with a similar DPI as MacBook between 21" and 23". You must choose between screen size and pixel density. However, it is not very convenient to have a very high resolution on a relatively small display. Take it into consideration.   If you change your mind and want non-Apple product as an alternative to Thunderbolt Monitor (27"), think about Dell Ultra HD 5K Monitor UP2715K 27-Inch.    Based on http://isthisretina.com/:    If you really want something smaller, then I'd recommend Dell P2415Q. It is 23.8" but has an Ultra HD resolution (4K):   Check the gallery here.  Dell P2415Q:   4K LCD monitor (2M:1, 300 cd/m2, 3840 x 2160, 8ms) wide colour coverage at 99% sRGB full adjustability (stand enables tilt 5Â° forward or 21Â° backward) DisplayPort 1.2        If screen size between 21" and 23" is a must-have, then choose Dell P2214H (21.5 inch Widescreen LCD)   Pros:   21.5" - meets your requirements Full HD 1920 x 1080 resolution ultra-wide 178Â°/178Â° viewing angle VESA compatibility monitor stand has full adjustability features easily transition from landscape to portrait orientation
Sony's Xperia Z3 Compact and Xperia Z5 Compact are about the same size as the iPhone 6 (not plus). They also seem to be the only (as of beginning of Oct, 2015) high end Android devices with screens under 5 inches. Sony's Z3 and Z3 compact have some very excellent battery life compared to other Android manufacturers. The Z5 compact is expected to be released in October, and thus has not been reviewed yet. It does use the very hot Snapdragon 810, so it remains to be seen if the extra 100 maH (to 2700 mAh) in the battery is enough to last as long as the Snapdragon 801 and 2600 mAh battery in the Z3 Compact. Both the Z3 Compact and the Z5 compact have non-removable batteries, so if you need more life than they provide, you'll have to use an external solution rather than swapping the internal batteries.  Note that in general, larger phones' battery life will be less affected by radio usage than smaller phones, because more of the power drain shifts to power the display, reducing the relative amount used by the radio.
Belford's answer is probably the way to go.  But, if you search around, you may be able to find a used IBM T220 or T221 or one of the rebrands. These monitors were sold between 2001 and 2005, with a native resolution of 3840Ã—2400 pixels (WQUXGA) on a screen with a diagonal of 22.2 inches  Their pixel density works out to 204 ppi.  Due to their age, they preceded HDMI (mostly) and DisplayPort (entirely), instead relying on multiple DVI connectors, so you will need adaptors.  Also, their maximum refresh rate is 48 Hz, but may be lower depending on exactly how you connect to them. They should be fine for programming, writing, and 24-30 fps video, but they may be too slow for games and some (i.e. 60 fps) video.
There's no difference between "1.3V" and "1.3Vdc": they both refer to RAM that works off of 1.3-volt electricity.  The "dc" bit specifies "direct current", but since everything in a computer is direct current, saying so is a bit redundant.
It doesn't actually make a difference.  "dc", properly capitalized as "DC", refers to direct current. So 1.3 V DC simply means that the required RAM runs using 1.3 volts of direct current. (If you don't know about direct vs. alternating current, you can read about the differences here).  Now, if you look at the power cable that's probably attached to your computer, there'll be a brick somewhere in the middle of it. That brick is the AC transadapter, which is a combination of an adapter and a transformer. It performs the function of transforming the incoming power down to a lower voltage that's safe for the computer (usually 12 V, though it can vary), and then adapting the AC current that comes from the socket outlet and through the transformer into DC current, because that's what computers work on.  That's important because it means that any type of RAM runs on DC. Even if something specified AC for some RAM, the RAM wouldn't get AC because the only power coming into the computer and components is DC. Hence, a RAM package that's specified 1.3 V is no different in terms of power requirements from another that's specified 1.3 V DC.
Any overclockable Intel CPU, if you're willing, or the i7 4790K ($317.99@SuperBiiz) if you're not. Don't just look at clock speed. AMD's FX 9590 has a 5 GHz boost speed, but is slower than Intel's offerings because of a low IPC.  A good budget option for overclockers is the dual core Pentium G3258 ($64.99@NCIX), at a mere U$65. Intel released this unlocked CPU for celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Pentium brand. With decent cooling, it can easily match the frequency, and therefore single core performance (approximately), of the i7 that is U$250 more expensive.  Another option, featuring Intel's new Skylake architecture, is the i5 6600K ($248.95@Amazon), which gives an average overclock of 4.5 GHz on air. Because it uses a newer microarchitecture, it is, clock for clock, about 5% faster than the Haswell CPUs like the 4790K and the G3258.  It also allows you to purchase more, faster RAM, as the Skylake platform supports DDR4. Because of the newer, less mature technology, the total price of the system is likely to be around the same as one with the 4790K.
â€œLess than 2 inchesâ€ and â€œready to use without building a circuitâ€ are difficult requirements to meet, but:     Something like the display on the Apple Watch would be perfect.   Then why not use it?  Pick whichever smartwatch platform looks easiest for you to program for, and write an app that'll display your test images. Or maybe find one that already exists that can do the job (like a slide show or impractically-small-remote-desktop app). You don't need to publish the app, just run it in developer mode.  This doesn't give an external-monitor type connection like you asked for, but hopefully being able to run graphics code on the device does the job.  You can remove the watch band to make it less awkward, and even use the band pins as mounting points to fasten the watch to a test fixture if that's useful.  This will easily fit within your budget unless you decide to use the Apple Watch Edition.    (I also thought to mention Siftables/Sifteo as a tiny-screen product, but it looks like they're not commercially available any more.)
Note that I don't have personal experience with either laptop, but I do have experience with the kinds of information you're using to make your decision.  I would definitely go with the Z50 here. To enumerate the pertinent specs:   The Z50 has a better display than the G50 (1920 x 1080 vs. 1366 x 768). To put that in perspective, my (non-Retina) 13" MacBook Pro has a 1280x800 display, and it's 13". The 15" G50 has a lower vertical resolution than my 13" laptop, and barely beats it horizontally. Not good. The Z50 can actually be cheaper than the G50, from a cursory glance at the prices (Â£449.95 - Â£499.95 vs. Â£499.95) Both have 8GB RAM, which is decent.  The Z50 has an "SSHD", basically a 1TB HDD with an 8GB SSD on top of it. That 8GB SSD, if the software running it is built correctly (it probably is) will store your OS and most frequently used documents, improving performance drastically. The G50 doesn't have this. See a comparison of the processors - the G50's i7 5500U vs. the Z50's AMD FX-7500. In my opinion, the G50 actually wins out here.   However, computers, especially laptops, are almost never limited by their CPU in real-life tasks. You'll see much more benefit from that SSHD than you will from a marginally better CPU. Even as a developer, the only time I max out my processor (2.5 GHz i5) is when I'm transcoding audio with ffmpeg, or, rarely, when compiling code. In other cases, my mechanical hard drive just can't keep up, and the processor has to wait to get data from it.  Also, you mention video editing. The graphics card (AMD Radeon R7 M260DX) in the Z50 will likely win out over the G50's Intel HD 5500. I'm not an expert on graphics cards, though - see this comparison for more information.    Either of these machines would be absolute overkill for Word / Excel / PowerPoint. For video editing, I would expect the Z50 to beat out the G50.
A lot of points listed below are coming from personal experience due to me having a very similar laptop to the one I recommmended. Lenvo z50-70   First of all I think it is very important to have dedicated graphics card for heavy graphics load like video editing and gaming. In this use case the graphics card is the most important part of the laptop. Also Nvidia has very good technology called prime. The model I recommended has this technology, it uses your integrated intel graphics when not needing graphics performance like when browsing the web. If you need your graphics power like when editing video, the nvidia driver automatically kicks in with your powerfull nVidia card to get the performance needed. With this it is possible to save a lot of power (battery life). I personally love this feature and it works without problems on my lenovo with windows 8.1 and various Linux distros next up the display is better than on the i7 model but has the same resolution than the g50. Personally I like the full HD screen, it is very sharp and colors are good as well. A good display is also extremely important in this use case especially video editing. The 256GB SSD makes your whole OS faster and is these days a must. It makes your programs faster and also your editing workflow more fluent. The processor is very decent and good enough for this use case. the nVidia GPU is slightly better than the AMD one (http://gpuboss.com/gpus/Radeon-R7-M260DX-vs-GeForce-840M) and I think prime technology just isn't a big plus. Depending on which OS you want to install nVidia and Intel is the way to go. I personally am not a fan of AMD Hardware because I'm a Linux user, I won't go into detail with this just know AMD can be a giant pain when using Linux. If using Linux, the nVidia drivers work perfectly with ubuntu/debian based distros and are very easy to install. The only minus is the 4 GB of ram that normally should be enough, if not you can easily upgrade to 8GB for about 30â‚¬ (http://www.amazon.de/DDR3L-1600-SO-DIMM-1600Mhz-PC3L-12800S-Voltage/dp/B00IIRSIK6/ref=pd_sim_147_7?ie=UTF8&refRID=1E7S7EWFK87F1EMHJJ1W)   So if you can spend a bit more go with the z50-70 I linked above to get better performance, if not your next best call probably is the AMD model z50. I would not recommend the i7 model g50 because it does not suit your needs at all.  I hope I could help, Tanonic
I use an EasyAcc PB12000 (12,000 mAh) to power my Raspberry Pi.  Given how long the Pi will run on a single charge, it does appear to reach its claimed capacity.  EasyAcc doesn't appear to sell that model any longer, but a pair of these 15000 mAh batteries should meet your criteria:   Total capacity: 30,000 mAh Total cost: $54 Total weight: 1.25 pounds Strap a pair of them to some sort of stiff backing, and you've got your flat form factor.
I would recommend Lenovo Thinkpad W520. As you probably know, Lenovo purchased the IBM personal computer business and the ThinkPad brand in 2005. T43/p & T60 were one of the last IBM-designed units.  Note: I own this laptop and it is just my personal view. I faced with a similar choice - solid workstation that will last for years. I bought it as an off-lease laptop for $400. In my humble opinion, it would be very difficult to get something better for this money. This laptop is 4 years old now. Answer is based on a 4284XXX model.  Specification (for versions: 4284W85, 4284E57, 4284B26, 4284A35):   Processor: Intel i7-2820QM with quad-core Graphics: Nvidia Quadro 2000M, HD 3000 Memory: 8 GB DDR3-1333/PC3-10600 (maximum memory: 32 GB) Maximum Battery Run Time: up to 10.80 hours (9-cell) or up to 21.6 hours (9-cell plus Slice battery) HDD: 320 GB (Serial ATA/300, 7200 RPM) Screen size: 15.6" (Active Matrix TFT Color LCD, 1920x1080, anti-glare display)   What distinguishes this model from the typical consumer laptop:   palm rest does not bend in too easily under pressure  solid hinges  you can open the display up to 180 degrees   Classical Thinkpad keyboard may be a plus for you.

iClever keyboard seems to fit your requirements.  Number row is included. To use with Android you just have to choose Fn + Q.  It is lightweight (0.39lbs =~ 176.9 grams) and tri-folding which makes it perfect for travel (size: 145mm x 95mm x 15mm).  To sum up:   compact size keyboard spacing is not cramped aluminum body rubber feet on the bottom (for anti-skid) bluetooth range: 10 meters iOS, Windows and Android compatibility   Cons:   size & placement of the backspace button (mentioned in the second review linked below).   Check the review here and here:     I have a few bluetooth keyboards and the iClever Tri-folding Magnetic   keyboard is the best for travel. It is the smallest and most compact   keyboard I've seen while maintaining a standard keyboard layout   (roughly an 11" laptop). The backspace key is too small for my   preference so that will take some getting used to. Other than that,   this keyboard is everything I want when I travel. The keyboard spacing   is not too cramped. It is only an inch less in length compared to my   13" laptop (my main laptop). The keyboard unfolds easily and only when   you want it to. Due to the magnets and hinge design, it won't happen   on accident. It tucks into itself so it is very easy to pack for   travel. The keys themselve have good feedback. There are many shortcut   keys that are activated with the typical Fn key (which is full size   and appropriately placed, thank goodness). There are no external   switches or keys to turn the keyboard on/off or enable sync (which is   a great thing. You hit the Fn key and letter C for BT sync shortcut).   As soon as you unfold the keyboard, it will turn on and connect to the   paired device. My devices found the keyboard immediately and connected   reliable throughout my testing.
This looks really great, but remember, it is huge. It's like a mini supercomputer!  http://www.eurocom.com/ec/configure%281,224,0%29ec  I'm not sure what the outside is made of, but I don't think it will break.  It has a 12 core Xeon and Dual GTX 980M which is probably one of the most powerful laptops you can find on the market. The only problem is that it is 17 inches.  So perhaps the Origin EON15-X, which has a desktop CPU (6700k) and a GTX 980M would be good. It is 15 inches and is probably close to the most powerful you can get at 15inches, as far as I know, anyway. I just can't see using a U series low power CPU for professional work such as this (other answer!) If you really need thin, consider the Razerblade 14 or Origin EVO15-S.
I have to recommend my favorite: the Fractal Design Define R5 (~$110 USD). This case is beyond excellent for everything you'd ever want. It's also one of the highest-rated cases for noise reduction (meaning it's very quiet). The specs:   ATX mid Quick-release side panel for easy access Removable ODD and HDD cages, removable fan slot covers, removable optical drive bay covers 8 HDD bays (can fit 2.5" SSDs as well), 2 SSD bays 6+ fan positions and 3+ radiator positions Interior is partly covered in noise-reducing foam Rubber feet to greatly reduce surface vibration Easily removable and cleanable dust filters on the bottom and front Front door hides front dust filter, front fans, and fan voltage switches (the clean, minimal style is amazing) Motherboard mount area provides extra SSD mounts 7 PCI expansion slots Front interface: 2x USB 3.0, 2x USB 2.0, audio jacks 22.69 pounds &ndash; with a full computer, the weight is still easy to carry around 3 color options and an optional side window can add $10 to the cost Bottom-mounted PSU that allows the fan to be mounted facing down   And one of the best things about this case: the included Fractal Design Dynamic GP14 140mm fans. These things are extremely quiet and can be sped up/slowed down via the switch behind the front door. Overall, this case is simply one of the best.
I recommend a Phanteks "Enthoo Pro Series" full ATX case, which is $100 on Newegg.    My main machine rests in this case. It sits behind my desk and the fans are very quiet. As an added benefit, I know it fits the parts I've recommended in the other answers I've provided, plus a full sized video card, optical drive and multiple HDDs and SSDs. It also has:   3 External 5.25" bays  6 Internal bays for HDDs 7 Internal bays for SSDs Front USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports, Mic and Headphone A power button on the top of the machine (instead of on the front, which is nice for it's placement in my office) Dust filters over the fans (yay!) and they are easily removable Has air vents on the bottom for the fan of the PSU   It supports water cooling if you ever wish to go that route. I have not had any issues with heat in this and I only use air cooling.  Wiring, with this case, is one of the easier cases I've dealt with. Both side panels remove and there is a small gap on the "back" (which is 'under' the motherboard, if you lay it on the side) for you to run cables. These cables can be brought back to the front through rubber points along the outside of the motherboard (once mounted to the case). This feature keeps the number of cables that block air flow to a minimum.     Everything in this case is opened with either a standard screw driver, thumbscrews or, in the case of the internal drive bays, a simple latch that locks the bay into place.   The case is a bit heavy - 26 pounds, empty - but I move my computers so rarely that it doesn't bother me.
A Nikon Coolshot 20 6x20 Laser Rangefinder is weatherproof, easily to aim, and works up to 500 meter, for 166.95 USD. Using one of those at each end should allow for communication up to 1 km, provided you can modify them: electronics.stackexchange.com should be able to help.  Cheaper still is Ronja (Reasonable Optical Near Joint Access), at 60 USD + 70 man hours for a 10Mbps optical communication link at distances of up to 1.4km. Lasers instead of LEDs might double that range to 3.0 km, or more if licensed or reckless.  The best and cheapest option would be WokFi:     WokFi antennas are fabricated out of commonly available concave metal   kitchen dishes or dish covers (which need not be perfectly parabolic);   Asian woks are favored because they have shapes closest to parabolic.   A commercial Wi-Fi antenna, usually a USB Wi-Fi dongle, is suspended   in front of the dish, attached by cable to the computer.            WokFi gains are typically 10+ dB, with range boosts, thus can be   16-32 times over a bare USB adapter. Ranges (LoS) are typically 3â€“5   km, although an aligned pair of similar point-to-point transceiver   setups may approach 10 km over a clear path. In addition, certain   improved WokFi antennas, and antennas made using surplus 2-foot to   3-foot diameter round or oval satellite TV dishes, allow even far   greater range, up to 20 km.
We use the HP Z Books at work for Solidworks/Ansys, they perform surprisingly well, we compared them to existing HP Z800 desktops and they were as fast/faster in tests relevant to our work (solve times, rendering, etc).  You're limited to 32GB Ram and 2 512GB SSD's + Blueray/DVD, but depending on your requirements that may be sufficient.  They weight around 3kg so not the most portable, cost is around Â£2500.
To answer the question you asked, and a couple you didn't...     Is it possible?   Yes     Do they exist?   Not to my knowledge - it's a very niche use to have to power from an entirely different source to the data, so nobody bothers making them     Can I make my own?   Sure     Any other alternatives?   A USB-Y connector takes power from two different USB ports, while only connecting data to one. This may or may not help in your specific case.
Generally the performance of brand name SSD's will meet all your criteria and be comparable from an end users perspective, the Samsung 850 EVO has been well received and can be had for Â£67 currently on Amazon.
I ended up asking Streacom (what an idea, eh?) and they confirmed that the FC8 should work fine with Thin-ITX, such as the Asus H81T.  I received my FC8 Alpha and can confirm that it happily accomodates Thin-ITX boards (I'm using an H81T, but Thin-ITX is sufficiently precisely defined that it should work for all Thin-ITX boards).
Since I recently purchased a Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro (now discontinued), I want to recommend the Lenovo Yoga 3 (â‚¬630 and up). Although I haven't used this exact product, I've used its predecessor (the 2 Pro) that is nearly identical to it.  Physical specifications:   Multi-gesture touchpad (scroll, zoom, swipe pages, switch windows, etc.) Full HD 1920x1080 multigesture touchscreen ~9-hour battery life (can actually last longer if you keep the brightness down) Backlit keyboard (Fn+Space toggles it) Only 1.58kg/3.5lbs &ndash; super light and easy to carry with one hand Screen folds all the way around (laptop, tent, and tablet modes) and the display can change orientation (perfect for reading) Very durable with amazing build quality   Tech specifications:   Up to an Intel i7-5500U processor (2.4GHz) GT 940M 2GB graphics card Up to 256GB SSD 720p webcam Bluetooth 4.0, 802.11 A/C WiFi 1x USB 2.0, 2x USB 3.0, 4-in-1 card reader, audio/mic combo jack, Micro-HDMI     The Yoga 3 comes in numerous models, the best of which is only â‚¬870/$980 for all the best components. This laptop (or ultrabook, whatever you want to call it) can be used for so many things. Lenovo has a huge sale on the Yoga series right now with about 30% off, so I recommend looking into this soon.
Probably the i7 6700k. It is very similar to the 4790K as recommended in all of these answers, however has a slight IPC improvement compared to the 4790k and is 14nm.  You can compare these two here:  4790K  6700K  The 6700K is also based on Z170, not Z97, which seems to be practically a dead chipset.
You should look at Sony's MDRV6. Its very clear, very comfortable, long lasting, and has great sound reproduction. I have used it for years and is very easy on the ears and even people sitting next to you cannot hear the music so I have used it on Airplanes and subways surrounded by others.   It is widely used in sound recording studios and is currently available for $79 at Amazon. It comes with a leatherette bag that holds the headphones. The cord has never gotten tangled  but they are long ( I believe 8 feet long).
I ended up using the Aten CM0264, which is a matrix KVM switch targeted at the small-office-home-office market; advanced, but not too pricey.  While the software is rather flaky (don't bother trying to do a firmware upgrade; it doesn't work), luckily the firmware it came installed with works fine and the physical build quality is excellent.  It had 4 device ports, just enough for what I needed (I'm plugging 2 video connectors in for PC1 to allow dual screen, and one connector for each of the other 2 devices).  The ports vary between HDMI and DVI which is a bit odd, but luckily they are basically interchangeable using adapters as long as you only care about video rather than sound, and both use a digital signal (so no nasty analogue stuff like colour bleeding or fuzziness on the screen).  Because it's a matrix KVM, I can independently change which input is being routed to which output console using buttons on the KVM, allowing me to display PC1 in dual screen mode, or just have one PC1 input and one PC2/PC3 input displaying (or even display PC2 and PC3 on the different screens).  I can also independently switch keyboard and mouse inputs between devices by switching the USB routing (I plug the keyboard and mouse into the separate USB slots rather than the ones associated with video console 1, as those get switched along with console 1!)  All in all I'm pretty happy with the solution, though I'd be screwed if I needed to add a fifth video input to the setup!
If you are looking at a single media which you can use for 10-20 years as a backup or storage device, then it will be difficult. All of the current backup solutions require access to a computer and have a shelf life. And a computer generally has a max shelf life of 7-10 years. After 7-10 years getting a new computer which can consume the same media is dicey to say the least.   The best solution is as follows  1)  As of today, i.e. 8-Oct-2015, Keep 3 external, non-Flash non-SSD, drives to backup your data. The quantity 3 has been chosen for having redundancy and if one HDD fails then you have the ability to still access your backup.   2) After 3-4 years or when you buy a new computer in the future, look at the most economically backup at that moment of time and move your data to the new backup. This may also entail modifying the file format from one to another. If when you buy a new computer the most economical backup is still a USB HDD then by all means stick to it. But repeat this every 3-7 years when you buy a new computer.   Please note that it is assumed that    the file format that you are using to backup your data will still be around  you will have applications and a matching OS which can run those applications in the future which can consume those file formats.    If you are comfortable with cloud storage then one can use Google Drive and/or Amazon AWS services too. That will also allow you to have data storage if not for 10-20 years  then for some years in the future. However if your backup size runs into multiple hundreds of GBs then please factor in the cost of bandwidth and the time taken to upload and download the backup files.   What you are looking for, i.e. 10-20 years of backup, is generally required by libraries or Universities or Government departments. Since these are corporate entities or organizational entities they have agreements in place with various companies to provide them this service. So for example IBM or some other company will have a contract which says, that IBM will backup say 100 GB of data every month for say 7-10 years with certain cost escalation. These companies then maintain the hardware and software so that the data can be accessed. If you are part of a corporate entity or an organizational entity then one can approach these companies. However if one is an individual or a simple retail customer then it is not possible to do so.

The GTX 980 Ti as the other answer mentioned would well meet your needs. It's super powerful, probably the most powerful video card on the market for < $1000 and is competing with the GTX Titan X.  Link  And I know it is a common misconception that gaming cards (such as the GTX series) are bad for rendering, but that is simply not true. The workstation cards are only really a benefit if you are doing ONLY rendering and if you are rendering with high poly counts. (> 250,000 or so)  As an alternative, you could consider the R9 Fury X, which is water cooled, has a higher computer power, but has a lower gaming performance than the GTX 980 Ti.  Don't worry, a GTX 980 Ti will dominate modern games on Ultra, above 60fps, maybe with AA as well.  Just as a fact, driving two 1080p displays in an exceedingly simple task. To put just HOW simple into perspective, I'm running dual 1080p displays with a 2year old Asus Vivobook purchased for $400 running Intel HD 4000.

I have not pulled the trigger on this purchase, (because of the relatively high price), so this is not a hands-on recommendation.  When I went looking for an e-reader for reviewing and consuming technical information, I was most tempted by the Icarus Excel.    It is a 9.7" reader and allows for handwritten notes too.  Since I was evaluating for technical learning, this was a big plus.  The Icarus site is not great, but there is a good review, with video, here.  I don't think the market for these larger format readers is particularly mature, and color e-ink may yet disrupt the entire market (small format included).  If the larger format is a must have, and money is not an issue, then the Excel looks like a good option right now.
The laptop I've been given for work seems like it would fit the bill quite nicely. It's a HP EliteBook 850.  Weight (âœ“) = 4.15lb  Display (âœ“) = 15 inch 1080p IPS  Memory (âœ“) = 16GB @ 1600 MHz  CPU (âŒ) = Intel Core i5-4210U (dual core, 4 threads)  OS (âœ“) = Windows 8 (Free upgrade to Windows 10)  Storage (âœ“) = 256GB SSD  GPU (âœ“) = Intel HD 4400  Fingerprint reader (âœ“)  This one comes with separated touchpad keys as well (it even has a little nubbin in the keyboard and separate keys for that, too), and - this is the main feature for me - it has a dock which you can leave connected to a monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc and just plug in to. Honestly, this makes my work life so much easier.  I've been using mine for programming, writing websites and doing general design stuff and it feels really easy to work on - especially with this dock hooking it up to a larger monitor most of the time.  Also, one thing you didn't mention is battery life, but I'd just like to say that this thing will last forever. It'll easily go 6 hours without a charge even with fairly heavy usage.  I'm not sure about the price of this specific model, seeing as it was supplied to me by my workplace, but I've seen results in the $950 to $1,200 range. The dock is sold separately as well and I think they're roughly $160 to $210, depending on where you get them.  Hope this helps :)
I decided on the Logitech G600 Gaming Mouse (~$80 USD) as the replacement. This mouse supports Logitech's Gaming Software. I plugged it into my computer and it recognized the mouse without having to install any drivers, and I still had all my profiles from my old mouse.   The mouse can have 5 DPI settings per mode and there are 3 modes per profile. The DPI range is 200-8200.  This mouse has 20 buttons with 18 of them being customizable (you can change all 20, but you have to have a button for left click and another for right click). There is also a function called "G-Shift", which is like a second page of macros for the profile. This means that you can have 34 macros on this mouse per mode (you must have buttons dedicated for left and right click, plus one button has to have the G-Shift function assigned to it).
The other answers are technically correct, but are IMHO unlikely to help. The benchmark you care the most about is your real-life usage of the processor.  Watch yourself using the processor and watch how the processor is doing in critical times, for instance by using htop or whatever works for you. Find the critical components, compare measures for those. For instance, it's pointless to compare benchmarks before knowing how many cores you need.  So for example I can open top or htop in a meaningful moment of the day (e.g. when the computer feels slow), rule out any memory or I/O issue; watch the CPU usage and find out Skype is consuming 70 % of one core, a chromium-browser thread is consuming 100 % of one core and another program I'm using is also taking all the CPU it can. Based on this, I know that for my web browsing I'd benefit from a faster core and for my multi-tasking I'd need at least 3 cores.  If you have access to the newer machine you want to compare (as in your case), go compare the CPU usage and required time for a specific task which proved stressing, such as opening a particularly heavy web page or searching a mass of emails in your email client or whatever (optionally using /usr/bin/time -v in your time for a specific command in the terminal, works also in OSX and many *NIX OS)

I bolded those which were relatively easy to find. Some close relatives of the Sparkle and Tiger can be found at 80 $ or less; the others are typically around 100-120 $. The Enermax seems definitely not worth its price compared to the Antec and Sea Sonic, but it depends a lot on where you are. Finding the OEM ones would be the real success...

Its more of a general class of systems but chances are you'll want to add your own keyboard, speakers and mic but a "nuc" class system and/or a mini PC of some sort would work well. There's a few considerations here but I'll go through them.  Before I talk about hardware, there's a few additional considerations I have. A Bluetooth dongle is cheap and tiny, and many systems have Bluetooth 4.0 but not older standards. Spend the 5 dollars or less on a Bluetooth  dongle if needed if the system is otherwise perfect.  I have the older bay trail "brix" - which is one variant of a nuc class machine. The current equivalents run Brasswell I believe. They're passively cooled, run Linux fine and have 3 USB ports.  A NUC is essentially a small, super compact PC built off of laptop grade processors. They take laptop ram and are pretty tiny, but you'd need to add your own keyboard, mouse, speakers and such. Mine has Bluetooth 4.0, but you'd need a Bluetooth adapter for older standards I suspect. These have fairly low power use, as is, and you can tailor your system to your needs to an extent.  If you want something even smaller (and cheaper), there's various Chinese mini PCs that might work - the x86 versions are just over a hundred dollars.  I have not actually used one, but if I was building a system for uses like this (or had another excuse to), I'd just pick up one to try. This ainol model was what I was looking at, but there's probably a ton of options   In either case I'd be able to (if needed) add a Bluetooth dongle.
There's chromebook class "windows for bing" boxen that fit most of your needs. I'm pretty happy with my HP stream 11 and there's a new, lighter version coming out soon. Lenovo has a similar system and I seem to remember dell did (tho the smallest screen I can find is 15 inches) and there may be others so most of this talks about the current (2014) and future generations of these. MS is actually pushing this class of systems in competition with chromebooks, and least with mine, the freebies basically covered half the cost of the system, including a year of office 365.  These things are typical for the class.   a low end bay trail celeron 2840. While it is 2 cores at 2.16 GHz to 2.58 GHz (burst), you can expect 6-8 hours of battery life. That said, these things are thin, light, and have something like a 6 hour battery life. Its obviously going to get replaced by brasswell. You might also find one with a quad core atom chip, but those are supposed to be lower end processors. They're fanless and run pretty cool. You can't find any modern sub 1ghz processors, but these things are insanely efficient, and probably give you less heat and battery life than the older atoms. 32gb of storage built in - which is a weakness compared to a proper olderschool netbook. It should be enough for your use though. While a chunk of that is the recovery console, part of your OS is stored there, compressed and read only to save space. This is EMMC and on mine, it benchmarks faster than spinning rust, but slower than a typical SD card. This is what I got on the stream 11      They come with windows for bing (which is essentially exactly the same as windows 8 home. Upgrading to windows 10 is doable, but I had some issues with the touchpad driver.  11 inch screen with a fairly thick bezel. That said, its lighter and thinner than my dad's Dell mini 10 Ram's soldered on I believe. I have 2gb of it on mine, and that's typical for the class   As for the specifics of the stream 11   Its actually got one of the better laptop keyboards I've typed on, and for a chiclet keyboard, very usable. The extra screen size also gets you a less cramped keyboard.      Build quality is solid. I throw it in a pretty cheap, thin sleeve (and for 2 weeks, wrapped it in a cloth shopping bag...), throw it in my backpack, and use it while commuting. Its still in perfect condition. This is surprising considering HP's reputation. You can get it in any colour you want as long as its pink or blue. Its matte plastic, and stickers stick to the outside well (which is an important thing for a hacker system!)      screen's matte and 1366x768. Its not a great screen, but it works well enough. one USB 3.0 port, one USB 2.0 port, HDMI out. Its not a lot, but there's only so much you can cram in a system that small.    I've managed to get fedora running on it without needing to change anything (since it has secure boot enabled, and I was too lazy to turn it off).   Not quite a plug for my blog but the images here, and a more complete review of my stream 11 can be found here.
Taking in to account your desire to charge your laptop, the largest battery I could find within your budget and from what appears to be a reputable seller would be the BiXPower BP-160.   Slightly over $200 at $209+shipping. Capacity of 153Wh, equivalent to 42,500mAh@3.6V.  This is likely 2-3x the capacity of your laptop's internal battery. Not overly small (11"x6"x1.25"), but it is flat and should fit in the bottom of most backpacks. Weighs just under 3lbs. Outputs either 12V or 19V.  Most laptops use 19V or close enough, and most netbooks use 12V.  It also includes a selection of adapter tips which should allow it to work with just about any laptop. Also has a USB port for charging mobile devices. The seller has plenty of positive reviews on both this product and as a seller on Amazon.  They also answer product questions.   They also offer even larger packs (which they don't appear to sell on Amazon) above your budget, like the BP-220 (223 watt-hours, $290) and the CP-300K (300 watt-hours, $400).
I've recommended it before but I'll recommend it again (and no, I swear I'm not an Acer employee): the Acer Aspire E1-572. It's a little over your specs in some ways, but it's a good laptop, especially for the price.   i3/i5 (in newer versions) quad core 1.7 GHz 8 GB DDR3L RAM 1 TB internal HDD Removable/replaceable battery (handy for being away from power sockets)   Mine came with Windows 8 installed. Newer versions may come with Windows 10. Installing Linux is about as easy as it is on any > Win 8 machine - they don't like it, but it can be done.  On programming capability: I use mine for some heavy programming (small games in Java and C#, plus utility Python 2.7 and 3.4), so you're sorted there.  On gaming: again, I use mine for playing games that are more modern that what you'd be playing on it. I usually end up on mid-low graphics settings because of the lack of dedicated graphics card (it has integrated Intel graphics), but again, older games should be better for that.  I don't have an exact figure for price, but it's under $600 - I got it for around Â£300, which was about $470 last time I checked.
I've got the 256gb variant of the Samsung 850 Pro and running a few tests would be quite enlightening. Improving compile time may also depend on processor so... it depends on your options. Likewise with IDE & Git performance. That said, I upgraded from an 840 (which I can't find the benchmarks for, its on my laptop at the moment) and it was a significant improvement. Enough yammering. Science!  BIOS time (boot time) is 15 seconds according to Windows. My system is a bit of a mess and I could probably remove things to speed it up more :)  This is a drive I've been using as a boot drive. Optimised for performance in Samsung Disk Magician, though kept fairly empty, since bulk storage is another drive.   HD Tune benchmarks      I believe these numbers exceed your requirements.  Crystal Disk Mark Benchmarks with what I believe is the default settings.    Few other nice things about this? 10 year warranty, and its MLC rather than TLC, which means better endurance and speed.
I'm not entirely sure about the AMD side of things but I'm running 4K now and I've been using nvidia GPUs and currently have a dell P2715Q.  Connectivity:  Generally DVI and VGA are nearly dead, they're getting phased out. We're in the arkward situation where support for HDMI is significantly better on TVs and entertainment devices, while DP wipes the floor with everything else on PCs. If you must standardise, use DP for PCs. If you decide to connect your console to your monitor (I don't judge!)   On the monitor side:  SST >>> MST. Its simpler, you get the full 60 hz refresh rate, and amusingly,  its better supported by hardware in most cases. You'll need DP 1.1a or better but meh, as you'll see that's not hard  Use mini DP or DP in, not HDMI - the standard for HDMI on PCs is an older standard, monitors may support the same standard and will only do 30 hz. In fact, if you must standardise, DP first, and DP for your best displays.  If you're doing photo editing, getting a properly colour calibrated screen a good idea.   If you can daisy chain, it'll cut your refresh rate in half. Not too recommended.  On the computer side:  I've gotten 4K output on a 660. In some cases I've managed to game badly on 4K, and the output wasn't the bottleneck, the ability to render the game was. I believe the 650 is the minimum GPU from nvidia for 4K (they have a handy list here)  and  anything better than that should handle it fine. 4th and 5th gen (and better) Intel video should be able to handle at least one 4K display. I can't find an equivilent chart or resource for AMD.  Something worth considering is the modern UHD display is only 8 megapixels. While its challenging to render graphics, and you might need power to render video, it should probably be fairly simple to build a system that can handle photo editing
Most video switches will attempt to draw power from the inputs, but if you want them to work in all conditions (e.g., no input providing power to one side) you need a separate power connection.  Your switch probably has a DC power input: just get a corresponding connector and plug it in.
I'd suggest my other dream case - the HAF XB     While it looks like a mini ITX case, its really a full ATX case designed to double as a workbench. Lets see   no smaller than an ATX-Mid case. its arranged a bit oddly but I'll take a full ATX board.  can support all picked out parts (listed and linked below)   I believe so    ASRock Fatal1ty X99M Killer motherboard: Will take a full ATX motherboard so.. yeah, we have room to spare Cooler Master Hyper 12 EVO heatsink: from the specs   CPU cooler height: 180mm/7.1inch Evo's 159 mm EVGA GTX 980 graphics card: People have done this.

My dream case, and I actually own this one. You did say minimum size right? Its a mid tower, but just barely.    The cosair 600T.

I have a full ATX board, 2 hdds, an SSD, a full sized 980TI. I could probably fit a small village of smurfs or a small poodle.  in this case. All your parts will fit with room to grow. It has nearly tool less drive caddies bays (6x 2.5/3.5 inch convertables - 2.5 inch drives need little screws), half of which you can move in case you need to park a dual processor video card of excessive length. Other than those caddies, its minimal tools, and I routinely just pop the sides to do maintainance, with everything accessible.   There's plenty of space to tuck cables behind the motherboard tray. Stock config is 2x 200mm fans (big led lit brutes) and 1 120mm fan (I swapped mine for a noctua 120mm). With the mesh sided model you can park FOUR more 120mm fans on the side. I haven't needed to with my rig.  it has 4 front USB ports, and a single USB 3.0 (which I'll come to in the issues)  Issues? The single USB 3.0 port's connected via a regular USB 3.0 plug - You'll need to patch it into the rear or buy a connector that breaks out the header into a USB 3.0 female pair - I bought something like this and hooked the USB 3.0 hub in my monitor to the second one, snaking it through a water cooling port.  Fan controller for 4 fans exists - you can hook it up to your PSU, hook up your fans and control fan speeds with the dial. I found it wasn't too useful and control my 3 fans via the motherboard.  Its a pain to move. the latches double as handles, but its so heavy.
The xiaomi piston 2.0/2.1 (there's a 3.0 model out at the moment) out but I've never used it before.    The cliff's notes version   Price: 20-30 usd depending. Got mine for 20 singapore dollars. Good sound quality - Good enough. I've tried it on my good gear on a lark and it sounds fine. My phone/whatever google play transcodes it to seems to be the limitation Reliability - I've had mine ~6 months I think. Its built solidly    Strong cable - Kevlar reinforced cables, sleeving on half of it. Joints are protected by the remote.  Comfortability - Has different eartips to suit your needs    That's the model I have anyway.  Reviews are decent and people tend to like it. And yes, they come with a case, rubber winding widget, and other shiny stuff.  The headphones are machined aluminium. Cable has a remote control and the length between the plug and controller's covered in a protective sheath, and are supposed to be kevlar reinforced. The headphones have great strain relief, and I've had mine for quite a while, daily use with no issues. Its built seriously solidly.   You'll get 3 pairs of smooth earbud covers in different sizes and one flanged one, which is supposed to fit tighter.     Sound quality's decent, my phone's more of a limiting factor (I'm an audio snob). They're about as good as you'd get for the price range. It comes with that lovely rubber headphone holder and 'jewel case', and street price is ~30usd.  Remote control is below where the headphone splits. Its got 3 buttons, tho the volume buttons only work on some phones.   That said, there's a lot of fakes of these so caveat emptor. I got mine from xiaomi directly.   Considering I was going with super cheapie headphones since I killed quite a few, and this has surviced me, I'd say these are a hardy pair.
although the answer from @JuanCarlosCoto was already accepted, I still must disagree on one point      ..Bear in mind that whatever external fans you may feasibly buy and   install will provide much less efficient cooling than an internal   one..   An external fan, providing that is is not a blow-fan or fan pad , but an exhaust fan type, can be extremely effective  - in fact much more than an internal one due to a much bigger facet surface and possibility to work in much higher speeds .  Exhaust type fans ( sometimes called Vacuum Air Extracting fans  ) , as opposed to blow-fans or pads, work on a different concept. they are actually sucking heat from the regular exhaust grill , instead of blowing air inside ( or in case of the pads - blowing air on the surfaces of the body ).  Typology examples from google images  ( but searching for the above terms will yield the same for your favorite search engine )  Doing that - they are actually taking advantage of the integral / original aerodynamic and airflow design of the laptop, causing the air to enter and flow over the heat-sink / the processor / GPU in a ,much higher volume / minute capacity ( CMq/sec ) all that through the original air ducts .  Several of my laptops have a desktop CPU combined with metal body and  and are really hot at times , in fact - so hot that I was more than once inflected with a heat burn !   All the cooling pads I have tried were somewhat of a hoax , never had any real influence ( 3-5 degrees Celsius ) - except making noise .  But when I found exhaust fans - the effect was extreme .  In my tests , on an HP 8560p , after activating an exhaust fan the temperature on the integrated CPU sensor dropped 30 degrees in 20 sec ( 70's to 40's ) with immediate effect ( meaning the drop started in 1-2 seconds !! )  The  second drop took some more time ( about a minute ) but it was so efficient , that the fan had to be stopped due to over - cooling now !   The test was made with a 10,000 max RPM external exhaust fan with 2 automatic adjustable speeds and 125.15CFM ( cubic feet / minute ) or 3.54 CCM ( Cubic Meter / minute ) sized 165Ã—80Ã—48MM 1.9W and cost 8$ !!   Another advantage is that these type of fans do not insert dust into your laptop like blow fans, but actually sucking the dust out !   And the best part - they are really cheap, and much more portable than the pads .
Plex suggests a passmark score of >2000, and suggests a core2duo at 2.4ghz as a minimum for a single 1080P stream.  I initially looked at the modern 'atom' architecture celerons but they're a bit too weak. If you didn't need realtime, 1080p transcoding they're excellent.   As such at modern processors a dual core 'pentium' based off a 'core' architecture would be a great option. I'm sure someone would suggest an AMD equivalent, which would likely be price and maybe even performance competitive, but as is, intel makes more efficient processors, and well, I'm familiar with them.  Lets talk about right now. I tend to use the falcon logical increments guides as a starting point for a new build. There's a minimum build based off the intel G3250, and that exceeds the necessary passmark score. Dual cores, and if you drop the add on GPU, the whole build is under 300 dollars.    For near future use, the dual core, dual thread G3470 looks like a good option. It's based off skylake (so you can take advantage of all the lovely new features the newer board will have). The Passmark score for the G3470 is 3,753. While this is a 'next generation' part, for a line that's just trickling into retail, its worth considering this would be a future proof design, which you can upgrade to the next generation, and motherboards may support newfangled things like m.2 and DDR4 optionally. I'd actually have recommended a G3270, if it existed.
The Seasonic Platinum series seems to be good.  The Seasonic site says it has a 92% power efficiency.  It's also fanless, so it's super quiet. However, it is very expensive for a 400W PSU. However this seems to be one of the most efficient, if that is what you are looking for.
I suspect what you will need here is a 'virtual webcam' - i.e. it's not just a media (socket) converter you need here, but a 'box' which the computer, via USB, detects as a webcam.  Consider a normal webcam - it contains a small camera and a set of circuits which get that video from the camera to the computer. The computer recognises these circuits as 'a webcam' and, via appropriate drivers, then knows what to do with it.  What you are looking for is for your digital camera to act as a Webcam. Unless it has this functionality built in (in which case it would have some sort of USB interface and appropriate software/drivers to suit) then you need the actual 'webcam' (set of circuits I described above) to sit in between your camera and your computer.   So, effectively, what you need is a 'webcam' (set of circuits) which instead of taking its picture from a small, on-board camera, takes its picture from an HDMI input socket. The rest of the circuitry, after that point, would be the same as any standard webcam - and the computer would see it as a webcam.  This type of functionality may be more likely to exist as some sort of USB video capture card, rather than an HDMI to USB converter, as most 'HDMI to USB' adapters will be intended for output rather than input - i.e. connecting an external HDMI monitor to a computer by USB.  If such a device exists, I suspect it will cost more than a decent HD webcam. Unless the camera you want to use is 'professional grade', i.e. priced at thousands of pounds/dollars, I suspect you will be better off with a decent, modern webcam. I've personal experience with the Logitech series - we use several models in the Â£50-Â£200 mark in our offices for video conferencing. They also do wide angle models if required.
Since you mentioned EU 230V, I've tried to source from EU suppliers. The first OEM that sprang to mind was Seasonic. Indeed, there's the Seasonic X-400 Fanless 400W, 140,13 euros at Amazon.it. There's also the Titanium rated AX 1500i, but that's less efficent and way too costly.  However, monetarily, is it really worth it? Even a good quality PSU is unlikely to be used for more than 10 years. Let's round that up and assume it's on 24/7 for 88 thousand hours. A 80+ Gold unit is typically significantly cheaper than a Platinum unit of similar rating. For an approximately three watt difference in efficiency, that's about 264 kWh. It depends on your electricity price, but in most places, you won't even recoup your investment, and even if you do, you'd be better off buying a high-yield bond.  So, for cost, I'm going to recommend a 80+ Gold unit, the 350W Super Flower SF-350P14XE Golden Green (59,69 euros). Obviously, there are the environmentalists among us, though, would would be willing to save a few watts regardless of the cost (a commendable motive), for which the Seasonic offering would be the obvious pick.  I've switched over to Amazon.it, the original links form Amazon.de for the Platinum and Gold rated PSUs are here
With every new generation of cards, there will inevitably be a bump to the best available fanless cards (which is as good as it gets in terms of quietness), though it will tend to lag by 6-12 months.  Therefore, generally I would recommend looking for the best options available to you while filtering on fanless cooling, or take a look at the active-but-quiet options on a site like QuietPC.  When you start to whittle things down, be mindful of the release date of the card and do a little due diligence to see when there might be a new passive/quiet bump coming.  Finally, because I have not been in the market for a quiet GPU for a while, I can't currently make a hands-on recommendation. However, with that said, based on your listed requirements, currently the Sapphire AMD R7 250 Ultimate Fanless would seem to be a good candidate:    The TDP of the R7 250 is listed at 65W which is less than the 5770, so you should be fine in terms of power.  Of course, you will need to make sure you have some air flow in your case and enough space for that monster heat sink.  How much you need will depend on usage, ambient temperature etc. so it is hard to definitively say you will be OK - sometimes the only way to tell is to try.  As an aside, I would not discount the Nvidia options - they have great Linux support in terms of drivers, and (like CPUs) the GPUs can often have very different thermal profiles.  That means that you may be able to get a much better bang for your buck from one manufacturer over the other in terms of quiet operation.
Adding more RAM might possibly help with your VM's. You should check task manager when running them to see if you are using most of it.  When gaming, more RAM won't help. You'd need to be running two games, skype and a couple browser tabs to get close to using all that RAM while you're gaming. Your GPU, on the other hand, is a different story. Upgrading to an   R9 390 ($330), or a GTX 980 Ti ($650), would massively boost your performance. Depending on your price range, the GPUs I listed would be a massive upgrade to your current GPU, for blender (when GPU accelerated), and games.  I'd also recommend using your old 760 as a PhysX card, especially if you actually play a game that supports PhysX. You could also just use it as a booster for Blender, as Blender supports rendering across heterogeneous GPUS.
First off, I doubt any active noise reduction (ANR) is going to beat out good passive noise reduction (PNR) in-ear plugs ("stoppers").  ANR headphones will be more comfortable than PNR and may provide better overall noise reduction for part of the audio spectrum, but not for all of it.  If you really need a replacement for a good set of in-ear plugs, you might end up disappointed.   My recommendation are Bose headphones.  I've owned a few of their ANR products* and have used a few competitor products, though not at the consumer level.  I can recommend the Bose QC15 headphones but they are discontinued (but still available) and the current model is the QC25 headphone.  They have   great ANR qualities  comfortable to wear all day no microphone are the around-the-ear variant of the headphones that completely cover the ear headphone audio is great $299 ear pads rotate up-down and side-to-side (to the point they can lay flat) the headphone cord is detachable so they can be just noise cancelling with no audio   They are not rechargeable, but (the QC15) takes a single AAA battery and you can use rechargeable in it.  * I have extensive experience with the Bose QC2, Bose QC15, Bose X, Lightspeed Sierra, and Lightspeed Zulu.  The first two are the same headsets in subsequent produce cycles and the QC25 is the next iteration of those headphones.  I don't have direct experience with the QC25, but I don't have any reason to doubt it.  I can attest to the QC15 being a great product.  The last 3 headsets listed are aviation ANR headsets which I have used in high-noise environments (slow twin propeller and fast twin turbojet airplanes).  I'd be happy wearing the QC15 in those environments and they perform well against those $500-$1000 aviation headsets.
The Dell XPS 13. 13 inch screen in an 11 inch form factor, up to 18 hours of battery life, OpenGL 4.4 support, powerful integrated graphics. 165 ppi screen at minimum configuration, and a free 12 month security software subscription (please don't renew it).  It comes in an ultra thin form factor of 0.3" to 0.6" depending on your configuration.  Starting at $800: Dell XPS 13  EDIT: One problem: the ssd is 128GB.
The choice isn't very wide.  I've been using Hama Roma and it broke down after two months. After this time it was really hard to use the left button. The mouse was missing almost every click...  JSCO Noiseless USB Optical Mouse is quite popular. It has a lot of reviews.  The most important part (source):     Ask yourself "What are you looking for?" If you answer a specific need   to have a quiet mouse to use when you actually need a quiet mouse   (I.E. late nights, libraries, class) and have a normal mouse to use   during all other applications. Then maybe you can splurge and get   this. But if your a gamer, playing a high intensity clicking game like   LoL or DoTA then either this mouse is not for you or you can expect   this mouse to last only months   This thread may be helpful also:      This is   the mouse I have been using for years now. The first one lasted around   4 years of intense gaming and I am using a second one now. I tried   several other but this one seems the best. Pro : Clic feedback on   finger, Nearly 0 sound (my gf doesn't complain anymore to the   clicking) Good balance although pretty light. Cheap. Found it at least   twice quitier than the G400. Con : The wheel still makes a little bit   of noise sometime, I solved it by adding oil to the mechanism. Not one   of those very well branded mouse with tons of feature, it's a mouse, 5   buttons, no macro and stuff.   The Nexus company has also several models:  https://nexustek.us/mice
This seems like a really cool product. Projects a laser keyboard and uses infrared to detect where your fingers are. You could actually fit it in your pocket. Only problem is the price, $90, which may be slightly over your price range.  You can buy it here.
I don't see a price range (and its a little pricy) but the microsoft universa1 foldable keyboard meets many of your requirements.      Responsive keyboard. I.e. soft keys aren't going to suit.   Its chicklet style, and the same sort of switches as the MS surface typing keyboard. Tested has a mini review that suggests it has a decent amount of travel   Full/large sized. I have large hands, and I need to be able to touch type. 80% full sized keys, though there's a split inbetween That said, as small as possible. A standard desktop keyboard sized keyboard isn't going to suit.   Its flat but wide. It should fold up to a pretty small size    Numpad, F-keys etc, aren't needed. Just letters, number row, shift, space and enter.   Yup 10keyless  Additional neat stuff?    It can pair with more than one device, and is compatible with the big 2 phone OSes, and windows and OS X. Not sure if its linux compatible water resistant  BT 4.0 based so you wouldn't need another dongle with many modern devices.  RRP is ~99usd, tho you might be able to get it for ~70 usd according to tested.
Apple's Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad are awesome, super silent.  It's connected via wireless. In my experience, it has worked for two years without failing.
To put it simply, the newer chipset you'll get with the GTX 960 won't really matter at all in comparison to the severe bottlenecking you'll experience with its memory bus size.  Explanation On the video card itself, the memory bus connects the GPU to the VRAM. Think of it as a pipeline carrying water between two points. If you have a lot of VRAM (the water) and a small bus size to go with it (a very narrow pipe), all that water won't be able to cram into the small pipeline to get to the GPU &mdash; you need a bigger bus to account for more memory.  So, memory bus size should scale with the amount of VRAM to some extent. The exceptions to this concept come when you introduce faster clock speeds (which, in terms of this example, push the water through the pipeline faster) and overclocking (in which you manually speed up the water flow).  The cards Now to look at the two video cards you're choosing from. The 760, while having an older chipset, has a bus size twice as large as the other card to account for the 4GB of VRAM. This bus size is still somewhat lacking, but it will do a much better job than the 128-bit bus. To get ideal processing power out of the 760, you'll need to overclock it just a bit, but to get ideal processing power out of the 960, you'll need to overclock it a ton (which ends up being more dangerous than ideal).    As for my recommendation if I have to choose between these two cards, I would definitely go with the GTX 760. But if you have enough money to upgrade even more, I'd go for anything with a large memory bus size and at least 2GB of VRAM.
Sandisk Extreme is a good mix of budget and speed.  smaller size is better performance on these devices Sandisk Extreme  USB Benchmark Links Like This are fairly reliable sources for your consumer research purposes
Yes, I agree that you should be in doubt about updating to a GTX 980. The card is not much different than the 970, and it is a lot more expensive.  GTX 970 vs. GTX 980:  Cores: 1664 vs. 2048 Base Clock: 1050Mhz vs. 1126Mhz Texture Fill Rate: 109GT/s vs. 144GT/s VRAM: 3.5GB vs. 4GB  EDIT: And to answer your questions:  Q: Will the 980 behave just like the 970 (only that the 980 will have issues at 4GB instead of at 3.5GB)?  A: Yes. However, it does have a few more CUDA cores. This will result in a greater overall performance.    Q: Will the game just crash if it tries to use more than 4GB of VRAM?  A: I suppose so. Most games will try to regulate the amount of VRAM they use in accordance to how much you have. The reason the 3.5GB is an issue on the 970 is the fact that games think they can use all 4GB, and when they dip into that 'defective' 0.5GB, everything slows down.    Q: Will performance degrade in a more progressive way (slowing progressively, or just losing details from the textures)?  A: I don't really understand the question. If you play at 4k and use high res textures, the game will start lagging and your fps will go down, because they game does not have enough VRAM to hold all the information.
Buy a tablet.   In fact the amazon fire looks like a great option here. In fact, its cheaper than a 7 inch tablet with similar specs from my favoured crapgadget vendor   Its a cheap, bog standard tablet (running fireos) , has a 7 inch ips screen and considering a raspi is 35 usd and this is 50 usd... its probably a pretty sensible option for what you have in mind. Maybe throw in a case and mount the case to the pumpkin, and protect the tablet from pumpkin guts and  throw in a 7 inch matte screen protector (for better daylight use), and its about as good as it gets.   If you're american? 2 day shipping with prime. Need more than one? They have 6 packs for the price of 5. Who'd have thunk.
Although this is a lot more powerful than you have asked for, for $195 you can pick up a used Lenovo X220 with a dual core 2.5Ghz i5-2520m off Ebay    Specs:   12" 1366x768 display Windows 7 Pro OEM licence No optical drive 4GB DDR3 RAM, mine only had one slot used too MSATA SSD support 250GB standard HDD Quite easy to find one with ~6h battery life   I got one a few months ago to take to college with me, and it can quite happily handle anything you would ever want to throw at an ultraportable (hell, video editing is even doable if you are patient).  Also, they are near enough bullet proof, in true ThinkPad style. Mine has fallen out of my bag straight onto tarmac on its corner from ~1m, granted you can see some of the black matte coating has worn off so you can see the shiny metal, but it still works just fine.   The trackpoint is fantastic on an ultraportable, the matte screen is great as is the trademark ThinkPad keyboard. More ports than you know what to do with: 3 USB 2.0, SD slot, VGA, DisplayPort, ExpressCard (!?), fingerprint and an easily replaceable battery unlike some new laptops.  I have Windows 10 and Linux dual booting on mine (have put an SSD in it) and it really flies.  Certainly worth having a look at EBay.
If you just want a display, adafruit has a very nice 7" display for about 70usd. DX has screens that are considerably cheaper, slightly dubious build quality compared to what the adafruit screens seem to have, and somewhat variable shipping time (tho its currently a MVP product and they promise fast shipping . The controller board's the same on both I believe.  On my 10.1 inch screen from DX, and the 7 inch version you need a 12V power supply - I just grabbed a wallwart from an old router and it works fine. Any 12V supply would do.    Amusingly, even the 'cheaper' dx screen's almost the same price as the fire tablet in my other answer.
Yup. Its standard as long as its the same from factor. For that matter 7mm and 9mm 2.5 inch drives, and 3.5 inch drives like that all share the same connector.   Just make sure its the right form factor to fit in the bay, but you should be fine otherwise.   If its a desktop, 2.5 inch (most SSDs are that!) would work with standard cables, though you may need an adaptor to fit it in a bay, or 3.5 inch drives would work.  For a laptop, thickness matters. A 7mm drive can replace a 9 mm drive with an optional shim, but not vice versa.  The connectors are identical.

What you need is called a demodulator.  Due to the digital switchover, they are becoming more and more difficult to find, but can still be found if you know what to look for.  It is essentially an NTSC TV tuner, sometimes with only a channel 3/4 tuner, that outputs some other standard output signal such as VGA, composite, Y-Pr-Pb, etc.  Such devices used to sell for less than $20, but are rare enough now that the prices have gone up dramatically.  There are also several on eBay such as this one.
From a cost perspective, your best bet is something used off eBay.  If you want something new, it will likely be way overkill.  Hauppauge has always had solid capture devices, and the HVR 1955 appears to have Linux support if you get the right one, as do many of their products.  This one happens to support HD as well (I doubt you'll find one with Linux support without it), but also has composite capture.  NTSC and composite capture are quickly disappearing, as no modern device use those outputs.  I've been doing capture for about 20 years now and I don't recall ever seeing a device with just screenshot capabilities, probably because the electronics for full video capture has been so cheap that it might as well be included in any supportable product (it's cheaper than packaging and shipping, so there's no point in not including video capture too).  EDIT: I missed the PAL requirement, for that you'd instead need the HDPVR. Linux support may be limited to MythTV (that's all they reference on the site), but that should be enough to get video and you can grab stills from that.  I have an HDPVR--it was pretty popular as it was the first reasonably priced HD Y-Pr-Pb capture device for PCs. It appears to be the cheapest external capture device they sell with PAL support.  There's also this one on Amazon, which reviewers claim works with Linux.  It's much cheaper, but I can't find it on their main website, so it must be a European-only product or something.  You'd think I worked for Hauppauge, but I'm just a happy customer.  I had 12 TV tuners at one point and 8 of the were Hauppage.  They always worked really well for a reasonable price.  The other brand I had and liked was SiliconDust, which makes network tuners, but I don't think they have anything with composite or PAL capture.
If having physical controls on the front of your PC isn't hugely important to you and you are running Windows on your PC, how about a USB fan controller like the NZXT Grid Plus v2?    Up to 6 fans, uses the temperature sensors already inside your components so you won't need to wire your own in, multiple profiles, custom temperature curves, up to 6 fans, and it all runs off a box that you can just sit somewhere hidden in your case. Also, it's only around $30.  As for the CAM software which you use to control the GRID, I have been using it with my NZXT Kraken x61 cooler, and it seems stable, albeit a little bit bloated with ~100MB RAM usage.  I know this isn't what you specifically asked for, but it may be worth exploring?
Personally I prefer the mini-ITX form factor, so I ended up choosing a mini-ITX A88X motherboard, with the A8-7600 AMD APU (65 W TDP).  Consequently, I chose the Antec ISK110 VESA case, with 90 W power adapter. Antec claims an efficiency up to 92 %. Given the case cost some 80 â‚¬, it's really impossible to beat on the cost side; as for efficiency, the Gold unit suggested by Alpha3031 is around 89 % so it's probably comparable. There is also a case with 150 W PSU but it makes no efficiency claims.  I've not found tests for such adapters, but Antec typically scores well enough in 80plus tests (see my other answer) so I don't think it would lie. The adapter is AcBel ADB002 and its external temperature is around 38 Â°C after several hours of (light) work.  This solution addresses the use case provided by my question, but arguably not the specific question I made, because it's for 90 W power and not 100 W. It's also not suitable for A10-7850K and other 95 TDP APUs without downclocking. So I guess Alpha3031's answer is the most reasonable for the general case and I'll accept it in few days unless you suggest me otherwise. :)
I was assuming you're pretty much going to have to get a TV at that price, and you might be running at a lower refresh rate.  I instead picked up a Crossover 289K, sight unseen. Its an interesting series of compromises that seem to add up to something I'd recommend). I've been running it for over a year now, and its been fine so far.  I paid ~ USD 350 with shipping and prices from ebay and prices seem to vary a few dollars from week to week    (To the left, the crossover, to the right, my dell. Sorry for the potato quality photos)  Its a bit short, so its on a crate. If it worked for kylie...   While you can never trust the pictures sellers use, the 'official' beauty shot shows off the industrial design pretty well    Has Displayport, most modern conveniences including an OSD (which many of these don't have) and a adjustable stand. This particular model doesn't seem to have a perfect pixel guarantee which may or may not be an issue for you.  Mine was perfect.  Looks like all the HDMI ports do 4k60, which wasn't documented anywehre.  Box contents for me were a manual, a french style power connector, an entirely standard 12V PSU (so, if yours dies, you can replace it with a suitable standard unit). The PSU was nestled into the packaging so some digging was needed. You also get a fairly solid DP cable (which despite some reports about such monitors does 2160p60 quite happily). That strange triangle is a screwdriver used to screw the base in.   The base itself is a slab of what feels like tempered glass with 3 holes in it, which screw into a bit of extruded aluminium screwed into the back of the monitor. I found it easier to unscrew the 4 screws connecting the monitor to the aluminium, screwing in the base and screwing it on. You might also choose to ditch that for the entirely standard VESA mount.  The monitor has a pretty impressive set of inputs/outputs. One DP, 3 x HDMI 2.0 (one of which does MHL) , one VGA (1080p only) and a USB port for use with a basic onboard media player. It also supports HCDP 2.0 though there's no way for me to check.    This model has a remote control as an option. Get it.    Considering the lovely, large, very well labelled buttons are behind the screen, it is probably handy.    They are lovely, large buttons and labelled through the front.  Its beautifully sharp, though its TN and not as good, colourwise as my IPS. Still, its a great, sharp monitor for not much money. Colour caliberation went a long way.  Like many of these cheap screens, it seems to have some degree of backlight bleed, but this is primarily obvious in perfect darkness and I'm planning on experimenting with bias lighting to see if it helps. Would still totally recommend this as a second monitor.
I've had excellent luck with the razer goliathus, assuming you want a 'soft' mousepad.  I've had a few others but this has a few features that make it a decent choice.  The edges are stitched, so it won't split. This is a critical feature in terms of long term use. I've had lesser gaming mousepads have their top surface peel off.   You have two options for surfaces - If you're a twitch gamer, go for the slick surface of the speed varient, if you want more control (and I'm guessing from the relatively low DPI, you're a precision player) there's the control version.  I've got both (on different systems) and I'm relatively happy with both.  There's multiple sizes (I went with large on the speed pad, small on the control version) to suit your playing style as well.
Thinkpads are pretty much your best choice here. I'd go for a basic, mainstream series like T series (over the X series or the W series), since they're a bit more reasonably priced. I'd go with a model without nvida graphics, simply cause a simpler model has less things to fail. I've run R series (the old 'cheaper' version of the T series) for years, and the build quality's generally been fine. Avoid the E series, they don't have many of the awesome features a proper thinkpad has.   I've got 3, one old one, one even older one that I essentially inherited, and one more that's relatively recent, and all run fine. I do believe I also have one that's certainly over 10 years that ought to be usable up if the HDD isn't dead.   A 10 year laptop isn't going to be without minor issues. You're probably going to want the option to upgrade it, and/or replace parts over time. Thinkpads are essentially designed such that many/most parts that could fail over the lifetime of the system are replaceable easily.  Thinkpads are about the most maintainable latops on the market.   My R61's almost at 10 years Its pretty much stock, though I'm pondering replacing the drive with a SSD. With a thinkpad, you can upgrade or replace ram as needed without tearing the whole box apart. (my r61 could use a little more ram, I've only got 1gb.). I've upgraded it from XP to windows 7 to windows 10, and it runs fine, and very usably (I'm just spoiled by my newer systems). The old girl has legs  There's a few parts however that might be tricky. Batteries last about 2-3 years. Lenovo seems to use fairly standard external battery packs and a quick check on google suggests they're available online. If your laptop's a desktop diva its another story. The yellow charging ports on pre USB 3.0 models tended to break for me. I ended up supergluing it back on and its been fine since. The usb 3.0 models ought to be fine, since they replace the charging port with a USB 3.0 port, and they don't use the crappy plastic of d00m.   No matter what you get, a proper thinkpad's going to be a mechanically solid, troublefree unit.
JVC XX In-ear headphones all the way! Had 2 pairs so far because I lost the first one. Highly recommended!   Dirt cheap Ok sound Good noise cancelling Heavy bass Very durable
Skroutz is your friend :-P    Intel i5 5200U 2.2GHz CPU 15.6" LED LCD screen 4GB DDR3 RAM HD Graphics 5500 1TB HDD   http://www.skroutz.gr/s/6738402/Lenovo-G50-80-i5-5200U-4GB-1TB-W8.html
I recommend a 15" Macbook pro w/retina!  It has all of the specs you desire because it is exactly the same hardware.  Apple hardware is completely capable of running Windows and using bootcamp you can install and boot directly into it.  There is a cost to this, because you will need install media of Windows 8 or later and a corresponding license to complete the windows install.  This is probably a trivial cost though, as when I was in school, I recall MS practically giving away windows licenses (and in some cases just charging a few dollars for the installation media).    I don't suggest this as a joke.  The build quality, battery life, and trackpad are going to be hard to rival and if you don't need fancy extras like a touchscreen the hardware you already have is a great option for running Windows.    I realize a Macbook Pro isn't sold as a "windows laptop", and might not exactly fit your request, but the only difference in that regard is that the laptop is not bundled with a pre-installed, licensed, copy of windows.
The xiaomi piston 2.0/2.1 (there's a 3.0 model out at the moment) out but I've never used it before. I know folks have ordered a pair into australia, and ordered it off ibuygou. OP's mentioned this model which seems to be a plastic varient of the 3.0 (the 2.0/2.1 had these too), but I'll talk about the ones I do have. Xiaomi's headphones do typically punch above their weight pricewise so, its worth considering. Outside the "its metal" and possibily how it sounds like, many of these features are common across the product line.     The cliff's notes version   Price: 20-30 usd depending. Got mine for 20 singapore dollars. Good sound quality - Good enough. I've tried it on my good gear on a lark and it sounds fine. My phone/whatever google play transcodes it to seems to be the limitation Reliability - I've had mine ~6 months I think. Its built solidly    Durability - Kevlar reinforced cables, sleeving on half of it. Place where the cable splits is protected by the remote. Earbuds and most of the fittings are milled aluminum. Jack looks solid too.   Comfort - Has different eartips to suit your needs. Isolation - Its decent, though the level of isolation would depend on the tips. I can wear them all day (but I don't!). In some ways good passive isolation (which works at any range) is better than ANR (which   That's the model I have anyway.  Reviews are decent and people tend to like it. And yes, they come with a case, rubber winding widget, and other shiny stuff.  The headphones are machined aluminium. Cable has a remote control and the length between the plug and controller's covered in a protective sheath, and are supposed to be kevlar reinforced. The headphones have great strain relief, and I've had mine for quite a while, daily use with no issues. Its built seriously solidly.   You'll get 3 pairs of smooth earbud covers in different sizes and one flanged one, which is supposed to fit tighter.     Sound quality's decent, my phone's more of a limiting factor (I'm an audio snob). They're about as good as you'd get for the price range. It comes with that lovely rubber headphone holder and 'jewel case', and street price is ~30usd.  Remote control is below where the headphone splits. Its got 3 buttons, tho the volume buttons only work on some phones.   That said, there's a lot of fakes of these so caveat emptor. I got mine from xiaomi directly.   Considering I was going with super cheapie headphones since I killed quite a few, and this has surviced me, I'd say these are a hardy pair.
Bit of an odd set of parts here, and you'd need to build it but... the  X10SDV-8C+-LN2F would be a good start. Street prices seem to be around the 1000 usd range for the board. The xeon-d in general seems to be a great choice for this kind of workload, and this specific model seems best suited to stick inside a 'regular' desktop case since it has a cooler with a fan, as opposed to the passive cooling that the other models have.  You're like "what is this witchcraft?"   This is a motherboard that's specifically designed for low power virtualisation. It uses a SOC varient of the xeon processor sssentially you're getting a stripped down, low end xeon motherboard and processor  Its DDR4 based, and will take 64 gb of normal and 128gb of RDIMMs ram - and you need ram for VMs and that many chrome tabs. You could also stick a regular video card into this.  However while being a server board, you get shiny things like m2. You also get dual gigabit ethernet slots and out of band management through IPMI.  So why this over a regular motherboard?   Corecount - It's probably pretty hard to get this many cores at this price point. Its also cheaper than the enthusiast models I believe Its mini itx, but has a load of sata ports, but not much else. If you need tons of expanston, go somewhere else. You can throw this into a mini itx box with decent cooling and have a ton of power for not much space. IPMI support can be useful   Drawbacks?  Wierd formfactor, not much room for upgrading, and availability isn't great, no analog audio out or HDMI  If I was building a system for the most bang for my buck, this is where I'd start.  I'd note if I do end up doing this, I'd probably look at whether there's a skylake based varient out on the xeon D. At the moment tho, this looks like what I'd go with.
If you don't need the physical keys to change (and well, a keycap puller and maybe spare keys would fix that), you could get a remappable mechanical keyboard.  I've got an old school Razer BlackWidow - now sold as the BlackWidow Classic, but many keyboards of this sort would have similar features.   Has proper switches. Because of this, you can just pull and move most keys around You can buy replacement keycaps, even as a set. Backlight optional, there's models without it. You won't be a membrane-key-using plebeian. You can disable, enable and remap keys to your heart's content You aren't spending several thousand dollars for reconfiguring a keyboard. My key puller costs three dollars.
One important question you need to ask yourself is if you need industrial build quality and long term hardware support, or a research/prototype platform.  If you need an industrial PC, I don't have any <100 dollar options for you, but you might spend 100-200 dollars on a Compulab product. I have pretty good experiences with them, the hardware design seems good and support works as well.  Considering you mentioned RasPi, you might want to get an Odroid XU4, which not only gives you best bang for a buck, but also enables to use a (questionably) more secure eMMC storage that is attached right on the board.  But after all, any computer is not secure unless you either encrypt your data or make a case that you attach to something and lock.
I've been using a Plantronics Savi 700 Series for the past few years.    It:   Is way over budget at $400. I got this as a gift through a fortunate series of events. I'm definitely open to other recommendations of cheaper products. Connects to my MacBook through USB (the cord goes from the base to the laptop) The headset itself is wireless, and has range allowing me to walk around my neighborhood block with minor degradation of sound quality Comes with a box full of different ways to affix it to your head - right now I'm using a springy headphone-type holder.  Has a pretty decent microphone, with decent response time Has all-day battery life, if you remember to charge it at night.   My only gripe with it is that sometimes, if I leave it connected for more than a few hours, it starts to 'echo' - slowly turning into a high-pitched whine. I have no idea what this is, but it's easily fixed by turning it off/on again with the buttons on the base.
You may be able to use the video-transcoding capabilities of the Intel integrated graphics, but with no video port on the board, you won't be able to use it to drive a monitor.  If all you need out of a video card is the ability to play movies and show desktop graphics (ie. no gaming), any low-end card will do.  $30 will get you something like the XFX One Radeon HD 5450 ON-XFX1-PLS2 or the EVGA GeForce 8400 GS 01G-P3-1303-KR.
LGA 2011 processors typically don't have built in graphics like lesser models. That said nearly any modern card will quite handle video at up to 60hz at common resolutions. 4K might be tricky, but at worst you need a mid range card.   That said, I disagree on the suggestion of a super cheap, old card.  There's a few reasons. The specific nvidia line that mark mentioned on his answer's a bit problematic, and has a high failure rate. Its also roughly 7-8 years old, and its a little like putting a bike tyre on a bugatti veyron.  Depending on your needs a gforce 700 or 900 series, preferably midrange (a 960 upwards, but I paired my 'regular' core i7 3rd generation with a top of the line card, and its really good). If you have really have basic needs (and what you do does!) go with a lower end card, but preferably within the current or previous generations. The oldest I'd go is the 600 series.  What should you be looking for? HDMI's what you'd connect a TV with, and is standard. DP is the standard for computer monitors. Make sure your card has both.  Why get a better card over an old one?   They often have better gpgpu capabilities and video playback acceleration. You can often use your GPU to play back video. You also are more likely to have warranty coverage.
In the meantime, someone answered me at Network Engineering SE  It seems like the Intel 82580 network controller supports this. It is e.g. contained in the Intel I340 server adapter family.
Here's one possible way:   Akasa Euler S (~$120) Some Thin-ITX board (~$150) 90W power brick, same as used for HP/Dell laptops (~$20)   Add whichever screen, CPU, RAM, and SSD you like; attach the Akasa case behind the monitor and you're done.
This cannot exist.  If it's connected via USB, then it's connected via USB, no matter what it looks like and only software could provide the illusion of a "physical port".  Actually, I think I missed an important pat of your question: The old software runs in a virtual machine, so all you need is for your virtual machine to expose the USB-connected ports as physical ports of the virtual machine.  So the answer is still that "this is a software problem", but at least one that should be easy to solve.  I have no idea which virtual machine software you're using, but at least Qemu on GNU/Linux provides options like -parallel dev:   redirect the parallel port to char device 'dev' to do exactly what you're asking for.
It's expensive, at $300, but I recommend the Astro A50.    The manual for this headset is online, for you to browse prior to purchase. It includes set up instructions    The headset has 7.1 surround sound and works on both my Xbox One and PS4. The Astro page says it also works on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. I haven't tried it on any of those systems. The battery usually lasts about 6.5-7 hours.  I've had no problems with sound or voice quality on the XBox.
In 2005, Intel was running into severe heat problems with the NetBurst-architecture CPUs.  A gaming system would likely be AMD-based, running a high-end Venice-series Athlon 64.  For homebuilt systems, a popular option was an Opteron 144 overclocked to almost twice the stock speed.  Incompatibility with a dual-core CPU would be quite believable, since the first consumer-level dual-core CPUs only came out in the middle of that year.  Most mainboards required a BIOS update to recognize the second core, and Windows only supported the second core if you were running one of the business/server editions.  For a gaming system, 2GB or even 4GB of RAM would be more likely than 1GB.  If you've got an Antec case from that timeframe, you're probably using an Antec power supply of around 400-500 watts.  In the 2004-2005 time frame, a popular choice for a budget gaming card was the GeForce 6 6600GT with one of the best price/performance ratios ever, while an unrestricted-budget system would be running either the 6800 Ultra Extreme or the newly-released GeForce 7 7800 GTX.  If you're building a 2005-vintage PC, there's a reasonable chance you'll need a dedicated 100Mbps network card.  Generic-branded $20 cards with a RealTek chipset were nearly ubiquitous at the time.  As for OS, if you're into gaming, you wouldn't have been running Linux unless you were running strictly older games, or the very few games where the developer worked on WINE support.  Gaming was almost universally done using Windows XP.
In 2005, the most powerful single-core CPUs on the market (and the wet dream of every gamer) was AMD FX-55 and later FX-57. For such a machine, 2 GB of RAM would not be unheard of, even in 2005.  If you want something with more bang per buck that an ordinary gamer would be likely to have, an Opteron 144 mentioned in the other post would be a good choice (although it was introduced rather late in 2005). During that time, DFI LanParty motherboards with an nVidia nForce 4 chipset were quite popular for AMD rigs.  As for the GPU, the nVidia GeForce 6600 GT was generally a popular choice during that time. Alternatively, you could go with an ATI Radeon X800 XL which was rougly on par with a GeForce 6800 GT (the "Ultra" version someone mentioned was made mostly for the press and availability was very scarce).  As for the operating system - you definitely would not run any kind of Linux if you wanted to play games on your PC. But if your story is such that the guy re-purposes the PC for other stuff than games, then I guess it's OK. In addition to Debian, Ubuntu existed (from 2004) and some popular distributions were Mandriva (from Red Hat), Fedora and openSUSE.  Hope it helps!
I have the Canon MX340 Series Printer.    I've been using ths printer for roughly 3-4 years and it's been consistently reliable. According to this review, it comes for only $99, which is incredibly cheap. Ink is also really cheap: a two-cartridge pack comes for around $60.   The printer is accessible over USB, as well as Wi-Fi It has Copy/Scan capabilities And if I have one in Canada, it's probably available in Canada   Here's a few extras:   The UI on the printer is sleek, and easy to use. No fiddle of buttons that make you curse at a printer It also has fax capabilities The resolution for photo prints is really good, coming under 4800x600 dpi.   This is an excellent printer that has served me well, and is reliable - I've used this countless times, and have made hundreds of jobs through it. I highly recommend it.
I've been using an Apple Magic Trackpad 2 for the past week or so:     It looks great on a desk, the poorly-lit Wikipedia picture doesn't do it justice. On a light wood desk, in warm light, it looks right at home. It also lines up well with a Magic Keyboard. As as programmer, I click things a lot. Being able to adjust the click sensitivity is wonderful - I have it turned all the way down, which puts ever so much less stress on my hands:    Note that 'silent clicking' option there - this thing somehow can make noise when you click it beyond the noise generated by the Haptic Feedback thing - I don't know how they managed to hide a speaker in it (I've looked for it), but it's very realistic, rivaling the sound made by my MacBook's physical trackpad.  I have it off because I don't like noise, but it's a neat thing to have. The rechargeable battery is great, I haven't had to recharge it in the week or so I've had it. It also comes with its own Lightning cable, which you can steal and use to charge other iOS devices.  I don't know what they finished this with, but it feels better than my MacBook trackpad. It seems even less sticky - it might just be that I've worn some of the finish off my older trackpad, but this one definitely feels better. Doesn't require, or support, a stylus that isn't designed to work with capacitive surfaces, just like an iPhone.   $130 is a little steep, but for using it all day, it's completely worth it. Also comes with a standard 1 year warranty, and, in my experience, Apple means warranty when they say warranty. I've never had trouble getting them to honor one. That said, there's nothing in this to break - something electrical would have to go wrong, as there are no real moving parts. That in itself is a huge plus for me.
It's not quite just a keyboard, but the Logitech MK220 is probably the smallest big keyboard I've ever used (comes with a mouse). Battery life is measured in years and standard batteries allround.  Its full sized, just dosen't waste any space at all, nice clear non-backlit keys. Works with Windows and Linux, and over wireless via a dongle.   I think I paid SGD 35 for the bundle, though, of course, local prices vary.
From your comments on the other answer, and my own experiences, (and much to my own suprise)... dude, get a dell.  Or specifically the l1100/SK-8115.  I'm a keyboard snob. I have a backlit mechanical keyboard that over the years has mellowed down to a very comfortable piece of equipment, which some day I will hand over to my nephew. Its a elegant weapon for a more civilised time.  Sometimes though, you just need a damned, basic, mass produced blaster that shoots straight. You need a chinese made hammer, not a tool worthy of the gods themselves, meant to create works of wonder.  Its a dell. Its designed to be used by stormtroopers your average office worker. I've never seen a stormtrooper's rifle misfire, and I've never seen one of these dead. My last place had a box of them, and supposedly you can get these dirt cheap. and they survived sysadmins and artists alike. Wipe em down every so often and they're good. They have a decent feel for a prolitarian membrane keyboard.  Yes, typically they are used, refurbished, or old new stock, but this keyboard is one of the few mere mortal ones that might, just might pass the lethality test.      Full sized keys. extra large spacebar. Used it at my last job, and it ain't half bad.
You should look into the Logitech K120 Keyboard. This keyboard meets all of your requirements, but none of your preferences. It costs $15 USD + shipping. It has a large font printed on the keys for maximum visibility. Every Logitech product that I have owned has lasted over 5 years. My mouse that just died made it almost to 7.     Requirements:  âœ” Price should be < $25. Preferable < $20 âœ” Must connect through USB âœ” Must last a long time (more than 2 years) âœ” Must be full size. (Includes all normal keys, F1 - F12, and a number pad) âœ” Must be QWERTY âœ” Should have arrow keys that are the same size (for gaming), so that the â†‘ and â†“ arrow keys are not smaller than the â† and â†’. âœ” Must be available in the US.  Preferences:  X A backlight (multi-colored?) X Wireless (If wireless, it should last more than 6 months on battery) X Bluetooth connection X If it has a backlight, it must be visible without the backlight being on.
If your are into flat keyboards, I recommend the Cherry Stream. They just released a new revision with the 3.0. I'm using this keyboard for years and already bought it twice. I can't recall how long the first one lasted but it was at last 5 years with intensive use.  I'm not sure how much it is in the US but in Germany you can get it for less than 20â‚¬, which would be like 22$.  It doesn't match any of your preferences but all your requirements. As others already said, your preferences don't really match the price your are willing to pay. If you are not willing to pay a lot more I suggest you settle for a good corded unlit keyboard.     EDIT  After discussion in the comments it seems that it is a little hard to obtain the keyboard in the US. The 3.0 was just introduced a few days ago. The predecessor is the Stream XT which I'm actually using and which is available here for 35$. Didn't think about Cherry being a German manufacturer.
Wellll, this site is kinda quiet. Found a thread on spiceworks which is much more active. Found a couple of useful paths:   Dell X4012 is a 12port, 10GB managed, for $1239. Netgear 12-Port ProSafe 10 Gigabit Smart Switch XS712T // Netgear has unmanaged option for sub $900, and managed optio for ~$1400
The best webcam I have used are the various models of Microsoft lifecam. With the lifecam, I have had good success with:   HD quality Great color balance (the best I have had with any cam) Very good low light operation and color balance -- best I have experienced.   The Lifecam Studio, which is a notch above the lifecam model I have used, looks to meet all your specs:  https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/webcams/lifecam-studio/q2f-00013
I've helped to install an Amcrest system in the past. I can't remember if it was the 8-Channel or 16-Channel one, as both come with 8 cameras.  We installed 3 cameras outside1 and 5 inside. The outside ones have withstood two mid-western United States winters.   Installation of the cameras took time, but there wasn't much that was difficult about it. You need to keep track of what camera (and associated wires) you have plugged in. It'll make your life easier during set up.  The system I installed had 4 TB of space. The specs say this is good for 6 days of continuous monitoring. However, we set up this system to record based on motion and scheduled times when the system doesn't need to be recording, so there is more than 6 days of footage. Plus...do you really want to stare at 8 hours of night vision where nothing moves when you are looking for something that occurred?  The system has an Android app. It works well on both a phone and a tablet. You can use either to view live footage or archived footage. (Caution...watching video over the cell network will eat through a data plan quickly)    1If you go with this system, figure out where you are going to put the DVR and the cameras prior to purchasing the system. Then, measure how much cable you are going to need. What came with the system wasn't long enough for a few of the cameras we installed initially.
As a starting point, I'd recommend the Haswell-E i7 5820K. 6 cores on the X99 platform, similar to the Xeon E5 16xx v3s but cheaper, unlocked and without certain server features, it can currently be purchased at U$320 if you live near a microcenter, and U$390 if you don't. The clock speed can be increased, through you shouldn't expect much above 4.5 GHz.  Haswell-E does not pack a stock cooler, and it's recommend to spend a bit to get a big, tower air cooler. The Cryorig R1 Ultimate is U$90 at newegg, and is a decent performing 140mm cooler.  If you want a mid range motherboard and don't need any special features, the ASUS X99-A/USB 3.1 has a combo deal with the 5820K. Take a kit of CORSAIR Vengeance LPX 32GB (4 x 8GB), fairly low latency, and you can later drop another kit in for 64 GB.  The 2 TB Seagate Barracuda is a good low cost HDD for mass storage, and if you want, you can also get a SSD for fast boot times. I'd recommend the OCZ ARC 100, 240 GB if you just put the main OS (Hypervisor if type I) on it, 480 GB if you want your VMs' VHDs on it as well. The ARC 100 is a MLC SSD with decent performance for the price, though it is a bit slower than the 850 EVO, it's also cheaper, and the difference will likely be only around 4-5 seconds in boot time.  Since there isn't a big power hungry graphics card, a 550W PSU should be fine. My suggestion is the Fractal Design Edison M 550W. It's a Seasonic made, semi-modular, 80+ Gold PSU, with mostly Japanese capacitors. It is out of stock at the moment though.  Finally, the case, I'd recommend the Fractal Design Define R5, a reasonably spacy ATX Mid-Tower, that has good airflow while still being super quiet. You can get the windowed version for $10 extra, if you want to see inside your computer.  Total is about $1400 USD, from newegg.com, which is about the same price as the Motherboard (incl SoC) + RAM for the option by Journeyman Geek. The Haswell-E 6 core should be more than enough to keep all your VMs happy. If you want to overclock, 4 GHz isn't hard to achieve. Note that Broadwell-E should be out soon, and you can get that if you aren't in a hurry.
A Team Fortress 2 server uses about 500MB of ram for a 24 person server, with SourceMod and a few basic plugins running. The storage space you have is more than sufficient for 3 servers, as long as you aren't loading a ton of giant, uncompressed maps. The 8000GB of bandwidth will be fine for 3 servers. (I've run 14 servers on a 10000GB line, with a fast download server and never gotten close to 8000GB in a month). Compress your maps. You'll keep your bandwidth usage down and your players happy - downloading a 10 MB map is much faster than a 70 MB map.  The problem you may have is that you only have 2 cores. If you are running vanilla servers, you'll be fine. If you are running heavily modified game modes, you may experience issues.   It's also worth noting that MvM is very processor intensive. If you are running a MvM server, you will not be able to run 3 servers with only two cores.     I'd recommend the package you are considering, provided that:   You are not running an MvM server You are not running a mod like dodgeball and a lot of projectiles. A single or double projectile game should be fine You know how to compress that maps to save bandwidth
In almost any case, with a proper, modern compiler, compilation speed will increase near linearly with the number of hardware threads on your system. In the case of Microsoft compilers, even running with 8GB will be plenty fine, as they are fairly stingy with memory allocation. However, on *nix, I have capped out even 16GB with parallel make and GCC.  Modern CPU architectures are approaching peak performance, so even three year old top-of-their-class CPUs will still perform quite adequately compared to top-of-their-class modern CPUs. On the other hand, more RAM will always have an obvious and linear benefit.  To address your specific issues, however:  Of the two CPUs you specified, the difference in benchmarks is fairly marginal, with the only real big difference being the power consumption, as the i7 is rated to use about 2/3 the power. RAM, on the other hand, can be very useful, especially in the case of Java where the JVM just loves to gobble the stuff up.  To give you an idea (Source):   The i7-6700 is the same speed as the i5-6600k in single-threaded applications (or at least within statistical error).   The i7-6700 is 10-15% faster in full multithreaded workloads than the i5-6600k.   The i7-6700 has slightly better memory access times than the i5-6600k.   Personally, I would just go i5 and 16GB, but if you must upgrade one or the other, go for the RAM.
You'll find that you are more limited by RAM than CPU - especially with 16 cores. A 100 Mbit line will not be a limiting factor either.  So, going by your RAM, you'll have roughly 16-17GB that you can dedicate to Minecraft after the OS takes the portion it needs.   Experience has shown that you can get roughly 10 players per GB of RAM. In this case, you should be able to handle 160 players.    A few things to consider with the above estimate:   World edit is a very RAM intensive plugin. You mentioned you were going to remove it. This is a good idea. Setting a maximum map size may help as well. If players can't continuously expand the map, the server has less that it needs to generate as players explore.  Your hard drive is very likely a spinning disk, if you are generating a lot of chunks at a time (ie. players running out in a circle in all directions), this will be an area that causes some lag as the new chunks are written to disk. If you allow automated, AFK farms, those can eat into CPU and RAM. Be aware of those and consider plugins that limit entities and mobs per chunk to prevent someone from sitting at a farm for hours or days. Some plugins require a database (grief prevent ones, for example). Adding a database will take up some of your memory. However, this could very easily fall into the 2GB I allocated to your OS.
From what other people have told me, the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 is one of the best keyboards that they have bought. This is a full sized keyboard, so it has a number pad and will not be as portable as a smaller keyboard. It does have media keys (play/pause, next, previous, and mute) as well.   There are a few additional features that this keyboard offers. There is a Zoom Slider in the middle of the keyboard. It also has customizable buttons that you can program to do tasks "like opening documents and replying to email messages".   I am sure that I have missed something about this keyboard as I do not own one. I do know however that this is a great keyboard. I have worked at a few different places in the tech industry and this is a popular keyboard among my co-workers.
If you are willing to try a new keyboard layout Truly Ergonomic makes a mechanical keyboard that is structured oddly. It is suppose to be better for you than the standard keyboards (during long term use) and they have different key switch options. It should also be noted that this keyboard does not have a keypad, if you find yourself using the keypad a lot then it may not be a good choice. (Personally I did away with my keypad years ago, never used it in my development work and wasted desktop space).    Switch (key) types:  SOFT TACTILE     These switches are quiet and provide a gentle tactile feedback   that helps you feel when each key registers, allowing you to use minimal force.   CLICK TACTILE     These switches provide a lightâ€‘clickâ€‘sound feedback and a   gentle tactile feedback that helps you feel and hear when each key registers.   FIRM TACTILE     These switches are quiet and provide a firm tactile feedback   that helps you feel when each key registers. If you have used Soft Tactile mechanical switches and find them too soft, these switches would be best.   MEMBRANE     On membrane keyboards, the key passes through a plastic layer with electrical contacts and then through a hole to a second layer that interrupts a circuit to register the stroke. Pressing through these layers makes typing on a membrane feel like tapping your fingers on old, stale Jell-O.   (Membrane is standard keyboard feel and the quote is a bit exaggerated but does explain it well. These keys are soft and have not tactical feedback.)  References:   Mechanical Membrane   Note: There lots of different types I have listed some of the common types. Also if you are thinking about a mechanical keyboard please remember your coworkers and that typing can be quite loud with some switches (notably the click ones). Maybe ask them first if they are ok with a noisy keyboard.
GPU is usually faster, but I cannot find GPU benchmarks for Handbrake, so I'll recommend a CPU. Keep in mind that using the CPU I recommend, you need a new motherboard.  I'd recommend an AMD FX-8320E. The 8320 because it's practically AMD's top of the line, and the 'E' because that basically means it's better binned, and they are both the same price at the moment.  Other popular AMD CPUs such as the 8350, 8370, 9370, and 9590 are basically overclocked versions of this, but I can't bother to provide a link, so you'll have to search it up or not believe me.  I recommend AMD, also, because of better price/performance ratio. As you can see in this anandtech benchmark, the overclocked FX-8320E ($125) is on par with the non-overclocked i5 4690 ($200). Overclocking Intel CPUs would probably surpass performance, but not by anything worth $200, which is already at your budget, so you wouldn't be able to buy a new motherboard.  I know that some people are going to point out that it is hard to upgrade an FX-8320E to anything, due to an outdated chipset, but I don't think that 'dark fang' is going to be upgrading any time in the near future.  Unfortunately, when using an AMD CPU, you are going to have the disadvantage of not having a built it GPU. You can either get a motherboard with on-board video, or a cheap dedicated GPU.  I'd recommend a motherboard with a built-in GPU, which I know everyone thinks is terrible, but looked at his current iGPU. A nice, overclocking motherboard such as this, would be ideal for getting the most performance out of your CPU as well as getting an integrated GPU, but a more budget-friendly option could be this instead. I know option #2 isn't the greatest, but it is cheap. If anyone else has a motherboard suggestion, comment and I'll edit into my answer.
We had the same problem and found a somewhat creative solution by reactivating our old android-phones. We installed "TeamSpeak" on each of them and placed them in the childrens rooms. They connect via wlan to an old pc where TeamSpeak-Server runs.  My wife and I also have TeamSpeak-clients on our cells - so wherever we are in the house - we can always hear them.  When I'm sitting at the computer I always have a TeamSpeak-Window at the 2nd monitor, so I can even see from where the noise is coming from.
I'll recommend a Gigabyte BRIX, specifically the model with the i5 4570R, a 2.7-3.2 GHz Quad core i5. The iGP is a Iris Pro 5200, with the 128 MB of L4 cache  For RAM, I'd recommend a 1866 MT/s 2x8 GB kit, just for a bit of extra speed. It's about $20 more than a 1600 MT/s kit though, so if you want to save a bit of money, it shouldn't matter too much. Price is $94 at amazon, or $81 at newegg.  The BRIX takes a 2.5" SATA III HDD, one with 1 TB capacity would set you back about $73. There's also a mSATA slot, which allows you to add SSD, a mid range 250 GB version costs about $108.  You'll also need the OS, though I'm presuming you plan on using Linux?  Total price is slightly less than $700 USD.  Now, what features does this thing have?  The processor is a desktop part, with a 65 W TDP, meaning it's likely to turbo more than its power limited mobile counterparts. It also has 4 cores, and Iris Pro graphics, making the GPU quite responsive too.  The computer has 4 USB 3.0 ports, 1 mini DisplayPort and 1 HDMI port for a total of 2 external monitor ports. There's Gigabit ethernet, a headphone port, 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac Wifi and Bluetooth 4.0.
The i3-2120 is likely to be a bottleneck to the system if you were to only upgrade your graphics card to a GTX 970. The i3-2120 is only a dual-core CPU (with 4 threads), while the i5-3470 is quad-core; many modern games benefit from multiple CPU cores (and some even require a four-core CPU, such as Fallout 4).  The i5-3470 is much more efficient and newer than the i3-2120 (with a newer manufacturing process).  It really depends on what games you plan on playing with your upgrade, for example Grand Theft Auto V will benefit from the i5-3470's performance, far more than a game focusing on graphical elements will.    For Star Citizen I, its system requirements seem to focus on the CPU rather than the GPU, therefore you'd definitely be better-off with the i5-3470 & the 960.  Your motherboard has three PCI-E slots, so you might benefit in using both the 960 & 550Ti, with the 550Ti dedicated to PhysX. The amount of RAM you have is fine for gaming.    If you do not mind purchasing used parts, I'd recommend you get a 290X (eBay has tons of them) as you get more graphical power for less (in the UK, used 290X GPUs sell for around Â£160 while new 970s sell for around Â£200, making a used 290X Â£40 cheaper).  Ensure your power-supply is able to power a 290X- you should have at least a 550W PSU, with the recommended wattage being 600W. Bear in mind that if you do go down this route you won't be able to support the 290X with your current 550Ti.  You might also be able to get the i5-3470 (or an even better CPU) used as well, along with the 290X. It really depends how much you're willing to spend on upgrading.
I am not 100% sure about this particular model but this is very close:  Planar Helium PCT2785 27" Widescreen Multi-Touch Monitor  Take a look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMuxpMk3gow&t=0m38s  Other examples:   Dell 21.5-inches Multi-Touch Monitor with IPS S2240T Acer FT200HQL bmjj 19.5-Inch HD+ 1600 x 900 Touchscreen Monitor Dell S2240T 21.5-Inch Touch Screen LED-lit Monitor Planar PXL2430MW 24" Widescreen Multi-Touch LED Monitor
You could get better gaming mice for a 100 bucks but if you want all your technology running on one software I'd tell you to go for the G602. It's wireless but has a pretty huge battery life and about 11 programmable buttons, and it costs the same as the G600.
If you really want an android app you should look at certain brands. But if you don't need an app from the router manufacturer, basically any router with a USB and FTP-support should work. To answer your last question: There are routers that come with their own app, but usually you don't have to use that app (especially if FTP is supported).  I personally have pretty much the setup you're looking for. I have a FRITZ!Box with a 5TB USB 3.0 HDD attached to it. So I can recommend a FRITZ!Box for this purpose but I'm sure there are other manufacturers providing routers with a similar service.  All I had to do, was to set it up as a FTP server. Now I can access it locally in the network or from outside with my email and password.  Now, to back up the data of my phone, I use FolderSync. Again, this is just what I use and can recommend, because I tested it. You can use any backup/sync tool that supports FTP.  I just had to add my server and login to it and set up which folders I want to sync and where to sync them.  The difficulty to set something up like this is depending on the manufacturer and what they provide. For me it was fairly easy.  Summarized, I wouldn't look for just a USB port. Look at the functions it has and if it supports something like a "home cloud". I also strongly recommend googling the product name and read some reviews before buying. You may also find instructions to set it up as a FTP for your specific model.
There are a variety of notebooks that are capable of running Linux, and some even have it pre-installed by the manufacturer:    Dell XPS 13- Developer edition  A lightweight notebook, but its 13.3" screen size may be too large for you. It does however come with Ubuntu 14.04 pre-installed, so hardware support for Linux is 100%. It's a bit on the pricey side though, but probably the laptop with the highest compatibility for Linux in this answer.  It also uses the previous (but no less worthy- Intel 5th Generation Core i5 CPU) generation hardware, but however it is the smallest XPS 13    Asus 1015E  This netbook has a 10.1" screen, so it's within your specification. It is Windows-centred, but however an Ubuntu edition is available; this suggests that one pre-installed with Windows can be wiped & installed with Ubuntu instead without hardware incompatibility.  However it does use outdated hardware (the Celeron 847 it uses was first released in 2011), so you might find issues running NO$SNS & multitasking.    Mobile Broadband  If you have a smartphone with a data plan (and it's an extensive data plan with a significant data allowance/unlimited data), you can tether it to your netbook via a cable or WiFi. PAYG (Pay as You Go [prepay]) plans sometimes offer great deals for mobile data (my own for example, offers a week's worth of free unlimited data when I top-up), so it might be worth having a brief look at PAYG plans too.    Anti-Theft  Why not purchase a larger laptop & get a bag-pack? Most reasonably-sized bags will fit a 15.6" laptop, and is not a 'traditional laptop bag' so it is less likely to be a target for thieves (as its contents are far less obvious). Doing so would dramatically open up your options for your new laptop, plus it will last far longer.
It comes down to what type of DVI cable you need; it seems that DVI male-to-male cables mostly do not have ferrite beads, but DVI male-to-female cables do.  --  DVI Male-to-Male  Are readily available without ferrite beads on eBay. Are mainly used for connecting monitors to graphic cards.  DVI Male-to-Female  Are very hard to find without ferrite beads, in fact I couldn't find any at all without ferrite beads. However, you can get a DVI male-to-male lead and then use this adapter (or similar) to make it a DVI male-to-female cable.
The second VPS server has the most resources available to it, therefore it would be the better option. However none of the servers you listed will be able to run all three servers properly.    Insufficient CPU  It should be noted that you might run into problems with only two CPU cores. Try to go for one CPU core per server (so at least three CPU cores).  VPSes are virtual servers, and thus you share resources. You will share resources with other virtual servers running on the physical machine, some providers guarantee a full CPU core (such as in one of the VPSes you listed), but not all do.    Server Slots  You'd be okay with 16 slots to each server on the second VPS, but any higher than that and you'd need more RAM; 4GB would be the limit for the servers you want to host. Although the VPS will look like you have 6GB RAM (in the hardware specifications within the operating system), the extra 2GB RAM will only be available to you if the physical machine hosting the VPS has the resources to do so.    Operating System  You almost certainly want Linux, and most providers of VPSes will only support the use of Linux and not Windows, due to the virtualizer not supporting it. It is best to pick a popular Linux flavour, I personally use Ubuntu 14.04 on my own VPS.    I host a Minecraft server on a Platinum X8 server from Server4You; it is cheap but the service is very good.  The server has:   16 CPU cores; 18GB RAM (30GB Burst); 800GB HDD; 100Mbit connection   They also offer good deals on lower-specification VPSes.
Looks like you've got some interference somewhere. This can happen for a variety of reasons.    Bad placement of router  Radio waves cannot easily travel through granite and other certain materials walls are made of, and your WiFi signal could suffer from degradation if your walls are made of one of these materials. A solution to this would be one (or more) of the following:   Purchase a couple of signal boosters, and place them where WiFi signal is low; Use a home-plug (aka, powerline adapter)- get a dual-pack so you can plug-in both your Xbox & PC. This works by sending the Ethernet connection via your home's wiring- be sure to get a Gigabit set. Could simply be that you need a new router. This is often the case where the router is supplied by the ISP, as these are mostly low-quality routers that are not able to properly handle 'serious' Internet   So yes a pair of powerline adapters (I assume that's what 'PLC' refers to) may do the trick, but then it may not (see below).    Your router is too close to other appliances  This links to the previous point, but a router could be suitably placed but be too near other appliances, for example a microwave. If your router is too close to another appliance, move it to a location where there are no appliances nearby.    Your router & another router are sharing the same WiFi channel  To fix, change the WiFi channel by logging into your router's web interface & changing it appropriately. If you know how to use WiFi analyser programs, you can see which channel is free (if any) and then change the channel to that.  Routers on the same WiFi channel create digital noise (dBA), and will cause problems with speed, packet loss, etc.    It might not be your WiFi at all  Connect your desktop or Xbox directly to the router via Ethernet, and then run a connection speed test (ensure WiFi is switched off on the Xbox so the Xbox doesn't connect to the router via WiFi!). If it is much faster than WiFi, then you've got a problem with the wireless environment or the router itself (see above). If it is the same speed as WiFi, you've got a problem with the router or your ISP.
I ended up going with the VPS with 512MB RAM, single CPU core, 1TB bandwidth, and 30GB SSD.  This is because:   It was the cheapest option (even cheaper than purchasing a paid VPN service!); It has a Gigabit connection, whereas the dedicated server does not; VPN does not use much in the way of resources, besides Internet (it wouldn't have made sense to go for the dedicated server). This meant that some resources were left to run a small website on the VPS.   I couldn't find a provider that would co-locate a Raspberry Pi unfortunately, and co-locating it wouldn't have made financial sense as co-location costs ~Â£60/month (for a 1U server) and for that money I could've rented the dedicated server for over a year.  There was also the option of switching ISP to one that told me (when I queried about the problem) their Internet connections are recognised as coming from the United Kingdom (incorrectly). However this would've meant I would spend a total of Â£70 simply moving ISP (plus another Â£40/month for rental).    Raspberry Pi  Small, but efficient. Would easily be able to run a VPN service with room to spare for running a (very) small website. High co-location cost.    VPS  Cheap, but good reviews of the company behind it. Would run a VPN service & a small website, but would have trouble running anything else. Would be solid & dependable.     Dedicated Server  Looks cheap, but is actually the average price for such a server when setup & other costs are added. Would run a VPN service like a knife going through butter, and any other programs I would've liked to have run (even a small gameserver). However if only used for VPN, its specifications could be too much on the beefy side. Company itself also has mixed reviews.
I've a fair amount of experience with homeplug - I'm not going to recommend specific models since I have no clue if the sinoji plugs I use are available elsewhere or are the best option outside my current market. Wirecutter seems to like zyxel at the moment and are a good place for up to date reviews.  I'd suggest getting homeplug 500 or better gear if you want 100mbps. Typically the advertised speed is for the whole network, and you never ever get line speed over homeplug. I have homeplug 1800 gear at the moment. Its got better noise rejection and reliability, even if realworld speeds are ~300mbps. They do work fantastically for me though.   Stuff to look for? homeplug units must be plugged directly into a socket, no powerstrips. Get passthrough models, and plug a powerstrip to that instead. Passthrough models also filter noise. Wallwarts and other SMPS devices produce some noise that may affect signal quality, so plug them into a passthrough or a powerstrip on an extension cord.   If you get cutouts - it might be due to a powerful motor like a washing machine. Move the homeplug unit.  As for wifi, I currently have a 2 AP setup. If I was doing it again, I'd pick up "professional" grade APs - we used to have ubiquity APs in my last workplace and they were fantastic, with easy management. Ars technica has an in depth review of the current models here. They are 'pure' APs so you can hook them into your current router. I'd probably end up with a 3pack, hooked into more homeplug units or directly into a (better) router.   Features like heatmaps and the way they handle clients are far ahead of most consumer routers. At a certain level of complexity, these give you more options and information to optimise your network.
The perfect system here's impossible (and I'd be glad to be proven wrong).     The HP microserver gen 8 however would be a fairly decent simple replacement that'll meet many of your needs, though not all.    Size: 23.24x 23 x 24.5 cm Taller than your space, but this is about as small as it gets.  4-16gb of ram (I'd get the base model, and add ram myself)   4 3.5 inch drive bays (this is the tricky thing here)   Supposedly fairly quiet (I've not owned one myself).  You might be able to replace the slimline optical drive on top with an ssd or a 2.5 inch drive.   Standard flexATX for power.  iLO for full access to the system offline.  You also have an SD card slot/internal USB port if you arn't running windows and want to boot off either. You could probably use that for a recovery environment.   Processor options are low power, and I'd go with a pentium based model here.  If I needed more bays I'd pair this up with a comparable sized NAS.
I don't recommend fanless or water cooling. Instead, I recommend Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO (which is a newer version of the 212 Plus I have).    This is a very quiet fan. The specs say it's between 9-36 dBA. For me, it's quieter than the noise my video card generates. It keeps the CPU cool too. I don't have a "before" comparison, as it was installed when I built the machine, but I have had no issues with the temperature of the CPU. This is despite very processor intensive tests and real world work.  Newegg is selling this for $30, which Google is telling me is about Â£20.
The question was edited with a budget after I posted this answer.    If you are looking for something more fancy, something a bit quieter, and a lot colder, I recommend you check out the NZXT Kraken x61. I do not believe it fails very often, as it's been around for awhile and it's relatively popular, plus there are no negative reviews about the pump failing, so I'd say it's pretty safe. It is available for $140 USD on the official NZXT website.   You can get is from a 3rd party retailer $20 cheaper here.  Pros:   Variable pump speed (quiet when it needs to be) A lot colder, good for overclocking and heavy load Nicer looking (if you care)   Cons   More expensive than the other option Has the possibility to leak, though unlikely   I say it all depends on your paranoia and budget.
This is a slightly more budget friendly option, which is according to the budget which was just edited in, the Noctua NH-D14.  This CPU cooler keeps temps pretty low, about 5*C higher on an i7-4770k than the NZXT Kraken x61 I mentioned above.  The NH-D14 is an air cooler available here, for 56 pounds.  Pros   Is an air cooler, and therefore does not have the probability to leak Is within the budget Is colder than the 212 evo   Cons   Not as cold as the Kraken x61 Looks ugly as heck Is only 4 pounds lower than the budget.
As an alternative to @rubyjunk, there is a similar water cooler made by corsair that includes usb control for only $100: the H100i.  I have personally had a H100i on an overclocked FX-8350 (125w TDP), and the maximum temperature I've seen has been 40 degrees.   I did have the 212 Evo previously, but I found that it got unreasonably hot on my rig.
I don't own one of these, so I can't say how I feel about it, but it seems interesting.  This is a laser keyboard which is said to be "fast and accurate".  Pros   Supports everything, from iOS, to Android, to Windows XP - 10, and Mac OSX Is said to be "accurate" on Amazon page. Has bluetooth Supports USB Only weighs 5.6 ounces   Cons   Only registers ~7 chars/second. If you can type that fast, this is a con. Quoting an amazon review      must be used on a flat surface that is non-reflective and uniform in color.  Quoting the same review     laser keyboard is more difficult to see during the day than is a normal keyboard. It's bright enough to see, but in strong light, the edges are a bit hazy and when the product is new to you, this will slow you down.
Since streaming is a decently multithreaded application, I'm going to go ahead and suggest an AMD equivalent, the Athlon 860K, based off the Steamroller architecture. It is an unlocked CPU, dual-module, 4 CMT cores, with a passmark score of 5617, it shouldn't be much more expensive than the Pentiums. If you want a iGP, the A8-7670K is my recommendation, priced about $20 more. Note the CPU would be slower because it has to share TDP with the graphics. Otherwise, you can purchase a discrete GPU.  I'd suggest a cooler to go with the CPU as well, something like the Cryorig H7, to move the 95 W of heat away. You may even overclock a bit.  The Athlon and A8 both use DDR3 RAM. If you choose the A8, be sure to get fast RAM, because the iGP would perform significantly faster.  Overall, the AMD should be slightly more expensive, and also slightly faster.
I'm going to recommend the Be Quiet Shadow Rock Top Flow SR1 (Â£43). Be Quiet, like Noctua, specialises in making very, very quiet CPU coolers. The advantage of this particular cooler is that it also helps keep the motherboard components cool. Pulling air down greatly improves airflow around the motherboard. It's also more compact than the D14.  All three air coolers should be more quiet than the water coolers: The need for a pump in addition to fans negates the advantage of slower spinning fans. The amount of sound insulation in your case probably makes the difference negligible though.
13 million rows is 500GB?!  You must have HUGE tables--that's 38KB/row!  You must mean 13 Billion rows or 500MB?  I've been running a database that has grown from 500GB a few years ago to 1.5TB+ now.  If your server has plenty of RAM, any popular brand of SATA SSD with sufficient capacity should be plenty for your use case (if your cache hit ratio is less than 99% what you really need is more RAM, not more raw disk performance).  In a properly configured database server, the data drive spend most of their time writing, not reading (because reads can be cached--writes cannot).  If you have the money and time spent replacing bad drives is more important than cost, just get the one with the best warranty (though to be honest, I've used both cheap desktop and mid-range enterprise SSDs and had very similar failure rates).  You most likely want to use a mirrored set for redundancy (this would have applied to HDDs as well), and possibly database mirroring as well (depending on your desired disaster recovery point and time).  Depending on how hard you hit them, you may also want separate volumes for the tempdb and for log files (HDDs are usually fine for logs, though, as they do very little random access).  When you need even faster performance, adding more drives to a RAID 10 volume will give it to you, up to the limit of what will fit in your case and attach to your controller(s).  When you exceed that, you can switch to Fusion IO or similar ultra-high performance caching, or to external massive SAN RAID systems, which can also use SSDs and scale pretty much as far as you have money for.
Depends on your servers and your needs.  Now, there's a few options with different levels of, well practicality. I'm suggesting samsung drives here since I've had decent experiences with them but your milage may vary - see this specific kernel bug related issue, and their TLC line seems to have had issues. The flagship pro line is solid tho  You could go with the newer NVMe drives - they fit into m2 slots, but by happy circumstances they are electrically x4 cards. There's also native PCIe cards they're relatively exotic. Of course, you need m2 or spare pcie slots of the same size.  Puget system has a nice review on what seems to be the fastest m4 drive available Samsung 950 Pro 512GB. in this specific case, a good solution would be to get a converter to install it to a x4 slot, and use one of two of them would give you pretty amazing speeds.   If you wanted something a little less exotic and newfangled, the 850 pro is about as fast as sata gets.
Some hardware RAID devices like this have internal RAM cache of about 1 Gb in size (faster than any SSD and no care about wear), use supercapacitor to flush this cache to the non volatile memory in case of power loss and also can use connected SSD as additional cache.   Such cards may be a good solution if your database has grown to multiple terrabytes in size so it is too expensive to place it completely on SSD with the required RAID redundancy.
I've been using a pair of Sennheiser HD215 headphones for a good few years now, and they're great! They are in your price range ($69, as of 02/03/2016) and meet all your requirements. They are over-ear headphones and are padded. They provide an extremely good fit and are adjustable:      The Cable  Admittedly the cable supplied is great, but it is very long (3 metres). If you want to, you can replace the cable (the cable itself is detachable) with a standard 3.5" (1/8) audio cable. It's like an old-style landline phone cable, and I've found that it can often get tangled if you aren't careful.  It's also fairly thick, and can be quite stiff to begin with.    Build Quality  The overall build quality of the headphones is excellent, but however is quite flimsy around the headband to the point that if you wanted to snap them in half, it would be an easy task to complete. I've not had other headphones of this quality before so I don't know how this compares to similar headphones.  Apart from this, other parts of the headphones are very sturdy. It's unlikely that I'll be having to buy a new pair for a long while yet.    Sound Quality  The HD215s produce very high-quality sound, and the reviews for them prove that (see the link at the top of my answer). I've found them very good for classical music, but also dance & electronic genres. The bass output is quite soft, but I find that it outputs just the right amount of bass for the sound output (so, a good thing).    Volume & Distortion  No distortion whatsoever at any volume level, and these headphones are very loud. Obviously, the volume does not impact on sound quality. The cable does not have any type of remote/volume control on it, although you might be able to get hold of a 3.5" passthrough cable that does.    Replacement Parts  The foam padding & the cable are the only replaceable parts of the headphones. I've never had to replace the foam padding on mine, so the foam padding has a fairly long life, the same can be said for the cable. That's almost nine years without having to replace anything on the headphones.    Accessories  The 215s come with a large synthetic leather pouch (which I lost a while ago so unfortunately I'm unable to give my view on it). It can fit the headphones & cables while disconnected from each other.  No other accessories are included.
Honestly it won't make much of a difference.  While they are clocked differently, all of the core M chips (and indeed, all modern CPUs) are designed to throttle down when not in use.  The exact voltage and frequency depends on binning, so the higher tier chips could have a slight advantage, but it's negligible compared to usage by screen.  If you really wanted to optimise for battery life, you can always try lowering the voltage. The stock settings are usually too high. Note that this may void your warranty though, so be sure to ask the OEM.
The CL (CAS, or Column Access Strobe Latency) will be upclocked if it is too low. This means that even if you bought ultra fast RAM, your Macbook will slow it down so it can use the RAM.    Speed  According to Apple's Macbook Pro 13 configuration page for your model (MD101LL), your Macbook Pro can officially take a maximum of 1600MHz RAM. Sure, you can put in even faster RAM, but it will be downclocked to 1600MHz.  I've found nothing that states it is able to use faster RAM. Still, 1600MHz is pretty fast and you generally won't notice the difference even if the Macbook was able to use faster RAM.  The laptop can only use CL11 RAM (there's literally no relevant results when searching Google for CL10 RAM for this Macbook model). This isn't surprising; this model isn't designed to be a workhorse; it can be compared to Â£300 Windows laptops- if you want something faster, you'll have to upgrade to a more expensive model.    Type & Capacity  Apple officially states that your machine can take a maximum of 8GB worth of DD3L modules, but however many vendors have found that the maximum RAM the machine can take is 16GB DDR3L.  No, it does not support 32GB.    Module Suggestions  There'll be absolutely no point in using RAM faster than 1600MHz or greater than 2x 8GB DDR3L modules.  The modules that Crucial suggested are the correct ones to use, and the fastest your model will be able to support. If the Crucial Memory Scanner is available for OSX (I'm unsure if it is), then any RAM modules that it suggests to you are guaranteed to be compatible.
For that price you won't be able to get anything too great, but there are a few options still. I'll recommend the same mic I recommended to @JonasCz here a while back: the Tonor USB Condenser Mic. For being a small, cheap mic, it has great quality.  Specifications   Sensitivity: -55dB to 2dB Frequency response: 50Hz to 16KHz Sound-noise ratio: >36dB Cord length: ~2m Voltage: 1.5V     I've used this as a temporary mic and it easily gets the job done. But as @JourneymanGeek says, investing in a better mic (most people choose the SM57 as their first quality mic) and a small interface will be worth it assuming you'll be making use of this enough to warrant an upgrade.
This could help you find your answer.  As you can see for photo editing the 6700k is pretty good but not the best  As you can see here, the 5960x does beat it quite often then not but it's also 3 times the price  So between the 6700k and 5820k multicore: 5820k is about 25% faster. singlecore the 6700k is 23% faster. these are from benchmark scores  You cannot go wrong with either, noticeable advantages the 5820k has over 6700k is the memory bandwith which seriously quite high (Double actually) and the 2 cores (4threads) So after reconsideration on my behalf, the 5820k might actually be the better choice since photo editing softwares are all 64bit and multicore nowdays. You can even overclock the 5820k more easily than the 6700k. But then in gaming the 6700k takes the large, not by much but still noticable since it's single core performamce are pretty high. the 6700k is also power efficient and suports usb 3.1 natively (future proof)  5820k would be my choice, with a setup than doesn't bottleneck it's performances. Atleast for the next 4-5years you're good to go.
I have never used this, and I have never heard of this brand. However, this came up as one of the first results via a quick search on Google, so here it is:  The IOGEAR GUS402, a USB 2.0 switch for connecting up to 4 usb devices to 2 different computers.   MSRP: $50 Available on Amazon for $28   The IOGEAR GUS404, a USB 2.0 switch for connecting up to 4 usb devices to up to 4 different computers.   MSRP: $60 Available on Amazon for $40
And, more searching on Google has brought up this  The SIIG JU-SW0012-S1, a USB 3.0 switch that allows 2 computers to be connected to 1 USB device.   MSRP: $50 Amazon: $31
I'm going to recommend something slightly similar to the other answer.  Take a look at the Sennheiser HD 229 headphones (link).  They have great sound quality, and appear to match most of your criteria:   Over ear design Durable, I've had them for some time. No batteries needed, no noise cancelling. Insulated against sound Yes, it goes without saying In your price range.
I have a low end Radeon card in one of my closet machines. If you are getting a new one, I'd recommend the Radeon HD 5450. It is $30.    It has support for HDMI, DVI and HDMI output. It also has 1 GB of memory and has a PCI Express interface. It is also fanless.  It's not going to run high end video or play the newest games at max settings, but it will run a high definition monitor without a problem.    Update: For next generation (6xxx) of the same graphics adapter, go with Radeon HD 6450.
A USB graphics adapter would hit lower power levels (USB2 generally tops out at 5W per port, 3 can go significantly higher but doesn't have to); but the USB2 versions don't perform well with video or rapidly changing interfaces due to low bandwidth.  USB3 ones are supposed to be better in that regard; but if your computer is old enough that the IGP only does 2 displays (the last few generations of Intel CPUs have supported 3 displays) I'm guessing you probably don't have any USB3 ports.  I don't think you're going to find what you're looking for.  The margins in $40 cards are already so low as to be nearly non-existent, so there's no compelling reason for OEMs to go lower.    Also, unless you're using either a really old OS or a version of linux with a very light weight windows manager, I think you're also underestimating how low you can go on vram.  To improve performance modern OSes (eg Windows from Vista forward) generally cache copies of every open window even if it's currently hidden (so that if you bring it forward it displays instantly instead of having to wait for a redraw first).  IIRC this data is stored in VRAM, so you'd need more than just enough for double buffering.
I can recommend an application called Synergy http://synergy-project.org/     You can have a bunch of disparate computers connect to a single master over your local ethernet, and that master's keyboard and mouse signals go back the other way.  I think the limit is three rows of 5, so 15 computers.  Each can have multimonitors of their own.  Essentially you can have a "Single console" with Windows, Macintosh and Linux computers working seamlessly.  Naturally you can't drag windows between computers, but you can copy and paste text fine.  The benefits...  I get to use linux locally in my windows workplace, bu putting a linux laptop on my desk.  At home I have an older imac and linux side by side.  I have no connection with synergy, other than being a paid-up user.  There's a "free" version and one-time donation gets you a bit more.  This is a good use for an older laptop or a tablet too.
If you like the NUC then stay with it.  A NUC or other small hardware can run pfsense well with one NIC, provided you have a managed ethernet switch, and you're prepared to have full duplex 500 Mbit through your firewall rather than full duplex gigabit.  I had a small shuttle board/case with one onboard NIC, and no provision to add anything else.   USB was not a good solution either, due to CPU usage and general messiness.  So I simply set vlan10 on my procurve 2520 switch, and connected my pfsense box to a single trunk switchport that was configured to carry vlan1 untagged (the LAN) and vlan10 (the internet, tagged)  I swapped that box out for a 3 port APU, and it still runs on just one port.  If you have several NUCs for various purposes, then consistency helps later on if you want to swap and change them around.   Flexibility and reuse are important.
Mini PCIe gigabit ethernet is a thing it seems.     Some hacking needed (and warranty voiding maybe?) or maybe a 3d printed lid if its a proper NUC. I'd tradeoff wifi, I suppose, but there's reasonable workarounds for that.  It might also work with my current brix, though I need to work out how to cable it though
I specifically recommend you consider specifically a PC Engines APU. http://www.pcengines.ch/apu.htm  They come with 2 or 3 gig interfaces, and have internal mini PCIe slots too.  You can choose between the 2GB or 4GB ram models, unfortunately it is soldered onto the board.  The mSATA cards listed are confirmed to work with pfsense.  They use a serial console rather than VGA, and are proven to run pfsense fine. Added bonus, they're only a dozen watts of power draw and are passively cooled.  The cases are larger than a NUC but a lot slimmer too.    I own one, it works perfectly in pfsense, specifically addresses the OP's question.
You're going to end up getting something older. Pricerange though... hard to match.  I can think of something that would tick off most of the boxes - a Matrox P690 (I was thinking the G550, but no WDDM drivers)    PCIe x1 (hey, you don't need more than that)  list price is about usd $250 (yeah, not easy) but you can get it significantly cheaper. Lowest I've seen is 70 usd. Its a niche card. Did I say economies of scale? That isn't helping here at all. Its an uncommon, specialised card.   128mb of ram, 2 DVI ports, handles somewhat better than 1080p. Out of your price range, somewhat unless you find a fantastic deal. Runs on anything vaguely modern.
Which monitors that fit these parameters can you recommend?   Unfortunately I cannot answer this to your satisfaction, as I was going to recommend the Asus PA248Q which is a 24" 16:10 monitor.  Personally, I like the additional vertical real estate but you have your own preference.  Still, you might look for a 16:9 variant from Asus since this model has a lot of nice features such as a built-in USB 3.0 hub, IPS panel, and some graphic design overlays via the control panel (e.g., grid overlays in inches or cm, and various photo sizes like 4"x6", IIRC).     To everyone who has worked with multiple monitors before: Do you think it is important that both monitors are the same size? Is it confusing if one is bigger than the other one (or bad for the eyes or something like that)?   Yes, absolutely--in fact, I'd even go further and recommend that you have 2 monitors of the same exact model. Having 2 different models all but guarantees that you will have color shifts as you move a window from one monitor to the other.  Yes, it is possible to do some calibration of different models, but if they are not using the same panels you won't get them to match.  Another issue is that, in my experience, it does cause some eye strain to switch between two monitors with different ppi and/or different resolution.  It's also slightly annoying when dragging a window from one screen to the other and the mouse cursor gets snagged on a "corner" when you're moving from the larger monitor to the smaller monitor.
V-Moda Crossfade headphones...   circumaural (around-ear) closed-back for some noise isolation durable with replaceable parts (bonus: includes protective hard case) detachable cord in case it gets damaged no batteries stereo (yes, goes without saying) ~$100 ($80 on sale occasionally) decent sound quality (I'm no audiophile but they're definitely better than any sub-$100 sets I've owned, yet fall short of more expensive headphones, obviously)
I recommend the IPS ASUS VX239H, â‚¬179 at Amazon.de. It has an IPS panel, which has better colour accuracy and viewing angles. It's quite slim, and consumes less than 22 W, according to ASUS. The brightness is 250 nits, not stellar, but it should be sufficient indoors. It does have internal speakers though. The 5 ms response time is good for IPS monitors, and you shouldn't notice nay ghosting when gaming  Here's the ASUS's product page, if you want to know anything else. I'm fairly sure it meets all your requirements. Different sized monitors could be confusing, but you should get used to it after a while, if you use your computer a lot.
Project Fi works with the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P.  Here is what the official site (FAQ) say:     When will Project Fi support other smartphones?      The Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X and Nexus 6 are the first smartphones that supports Project Fi's network of networks. During Project Fi's Early Access Program we plan to only support these devices.
The difference between 16gig (i'm assuming that's what you're going for in gaming) of DDR3 and DDR4 is of about 40bucks (in france) so I think you could go with the 6700k, since you're not into overcloking that much. The 5820k would have been the better choice if you're gonna buy more memory (for editing stuff) than that (it has double the bandwidth). But for gaming that's waaaay more than you need. And the 6700k has native USB 3.1 support so a little more future proof.  And you can probably find good deals on the 6700k in those upgrade kits. And lastly the 4790k actually does better than the 5820k in gaming in a few tests so if the price difference matters go for that one.
Have I missed something? Is there anything more basic than this around? Like a low power1 $20 card you can attach a single HD monitor to?   Yes.  As Dan has pointed out in his answer, a USB video adaptor fits all of your needs exactly.  For instance, let's compare the Flashmen USB 3.0 to HDMI 1080P Video Adaptor to your requirements:     I recently needed to start using a third screen on my desktop   Adapters like this will run a third monitor.     I barely ever used this card because it was very noisy   They have no fans or moving parts, should not produce any detectable noise.     I don't need this screen for much -- no 3D, no video playback, mostly just generic GUI content such as viewing documentation.   They don't usually have much hardware acceleration, but the drivers do typically support video playback at 30 frames per second full screen. Some of the better USB adapters support minimal 3D using the computer's processor for the hard work.  This is important because you might be surprised how many programs, such as CAD or even web browsers and document viewers use 3D.     I have an HD monitor attached, so I do want 1920x1080 resolution   These HDMI adapters will almost always support 1080p.     One of my concerns about these cards is power consumption. ... Less than 5 watts would be great; less than 15 is okay.   These are under 5W.     it can't be a purely integrated chipset   They don't use computer memory as video memory, and are not "integrated".     a low power1 $20 card you can attach a single HD monitor to?   The one I listed at the top is often for sale right around $20.  It's not a great piece of hardware, but if you have a price limit of $20 and are ok with the requirements (windows 7, 8, or 10) and fiddling around a little with the drivers, then it exactly fits your requirements.  If you need something more specialized, then of course you're going to have to compromise some of your requirements, but at the moment it appears to meet your needs.
Please read this entire site which should quickly disabuse you of the notion that the technology is simple.   The reality is that high speed laser communication (ie, slow by today's standards 10mbps) is not at all trivial, and particularly over the distances you need. There are so many tradeoffs involved in the optical path alone that you could spend months or years trying to design something that would connect at all, nevermind provide a reliable link.  For instance, do you select a lower divergence, which gets more power to the end point, but means that if either end moves more than a micrometer then the connection is lost, or do you have a larger divergence which makes aiming less critical, but delivers such low power you have a hard time receiving?  That's just one of many, many trade offs and losses in the optical path engineering, and doesn't even touch the necessary low noise amplifiers and electronics, nor the physical layer interface to the network(s) or computer(s) involved in the communications. This also ignores the regulations of laser emissions in a city.  At any rate, if your requirements are   Laser communications Up to 5km distance Home budget size   Then the answer to your question, "Do they exist?" is no.
Wi-Fi/LAN capabilities, able play music, Netflix, all that stuff. I don't really want any of that.   The bluray specification requires that the player firmware is easily updated over time (mostly for copy protection features) and that bluray players include minimum functionality for internet coupled movie features. This is a simplification, you may be able to find older first generation players without networking, but I expect you'll also find they have a hard time playing some of today's newer movies and you may not be able to get updates for them.  As such you won't find cheap bluray players that don't include networking features.  Your best bet is to search ebay and craiglist for older used bluray players in your price range.  Try to find something only a few years old, again, the much older players will probably have problems playing newer discs without some effort on your part.     If I decide to bite the bullet and buy a $70+ Blu-ray player with all the bells and whistles, how easy is it to stream a Blu-ray movie over a network?   The bluray specification does not permit streaming over the network.  You will not be able to find a bluray player that does this for you.  If you need something like this, you will need to set up a computer and use it to read the discs, handle the decryption, and stream the movie.
Using 3 I/O, you can only charlieplex 6 LEDs.  The board would require an I/O expander, which would take up space limiting the area you could place LEDs.  However, a very functional, full color matrix LED board is available at a reasonable price from Adafruit: the Adafruit NeoPixel Shield. It's listed for under $30 right now, and requires only one digital pin.  If you plan on using all the LEDs at full brightness you'll need a fairly powerful power supply - 5V at 3A or more should do it.  Further, the libraries are already made and included, so the interface is easy.
I reccomend the Intel i5 4690k.  It costs $240 USD, and is significantly more powerful than your current CPU. It has 4 cores, (no hyperthreading) with a base-clock of 3.5 GHz, but is unlocked and could be OC'ed to 3.9 GHz. 6 MB of cache, and the TDP is 88W (which I believe is actually lower than your current CPU).  It meets or exceeds the system requirements of every game you listed.   BF4 recommends any quadcore intel CPU. Star Wars battlefront recommends an i5 6600, which has nearly identical specs, except for the lower base clock speed. Evolve recommends an i7 920, which has twice the number of threads, but a significantly lower clock speed (2.66 GHz). I'm not sure how well Evolve utilizes the extra multi-threading capabilities, but it's probably safe to assume it will run well. (At least, as well as it can run. It's still very buggy from what I have heard).   Given that all of these games are far more CPU-intensive, it should also easily handle Photoshop, unity, music streaming, movies and browsing.
When it comes to gaming CPU recommendations, take a look at Tom's Hardware's Best CPUs for the Money which provides well-founded recommendations for all price ranges. In your case, the Core i5-6500 is a good bet if you aren't interested in overclocking, or the Core i5-6600K if you are. They're both based on Skylake, the latest architecture from Intel, and drops into the LGA 1151-socket, so is it as modern as it gets today. Core i5-4690K is based on Haswell, it has similar specs but uses the older LGA-1150 platform which is being phased out in favor of LGA-1151 and Skylake.
I would not use wireless because wireless will be too erratic performance for your need.  Instead, use a couple of POE cameras, two long cat5 cables, two POE injectors and a switch or a POE switch, and a laptop to do the recording.  All of this would run off a 150W inverter which can run off a car battery.    Camera $100 NZ/each http://www.cdlnz.com/index.html?do=viewproduct&p=LAN080&code=NFC31-IR   These are 720p HD, so the footage is 1280x720 and is just under 1 megapixel.  Webcams tend to be 640x480 at 0.3 megapixel.  POE switch $60 NZ http://www.trademe.co.nz/975329444  you'll find something on ebay to do this. EDIT: Netgear has a cheap 5 port swith model GS205 which is POE, $35 NZ  http://www.trademe.co.nz/977028525  Cable, stranded cat5, 30c/metre or $100/roll of 1000 feet.  http://www.cdlnz.com/index.html?do=viewproduct&p=NC105&code=C-C5E-ST%20R   Ethernet is up to 100 metres from the switch, but you can push to 120 metres or so.  If you cut it too long, just trim off 5 metres and use that for making flyleads later.  Crimps for the ends $10 NZ   The tools cost a bit more.  Inverter to give mains power from a 12V source  $40 NZ  http://www.cdlnz.com/index.html?do=viewproduct&p=UPS600&code=IPS-250  Fully charged car battery - Best to bring a spare, or use one in your car.  Depending on condition and load you may get anything up to an hour before its too flat to start your car.  You can leave the engine idling, but this will use fuel.  All up thats about $410, but you have a lot of parts that can be reused or onsold.   You might be able to borrow some of it too.  I can't see how you'd do it for $50.  You'd be limited to two cheap USB webcams attached to a laptop, and you would have a maximum of 10 metres between them even using active USB booster cables.  Third option might be to use two action cameras, set them up and record on both, then stand in the middle and use a big clapper board to make a sound spike for synchronisation.  No matter what you do you'll need to find some software to combine the imagery, and something like google cardboard video player to screen it.
Since you are planning to play a game that require 4 cores, and also have a severely limited budget, I'm going to recommend a AMD CPU, on the FM2+ socket.  The Athlon X4 860K is a Steamroller based 4 core, 2 module CMT design. It has no iGPU, meaning its TDP is not shared. The newer Steamroller cores are quite a bit faster than the old K10 based Phenoms, though the CMT will mean float applications using the full 4 cores will not improve as much.  Why the 860K? It's relatively new, but uses a established platform with cheap DDR3 RAM. You can get a motherboard with all the bells and whistles with Skylake, but I suspect that won't matter as much to you when you can't actually play the game on a dual core.  How fast a processor is used to depend mostly on clock speed. This is not the case any more, however, because clock speeds have effectively hit a brick wall, and each new generation more or less sticks to the 3-5 GHz range. Core count, while important, can only be used in multi threaded applications. What modern day CPUs depend on is the IPC and instruction set.  The IPC is the number of instructions it can execute per clock cycle. With the advent of Superscalar and MIMD processors, this number has exceeded 1. AMD's current architectures only have around 60% of Intel's Haswell, which is why you see the higher clocks to compensate.  The instruction sets matter as well, but it ins't really something you can choose. Windows only works on x86-64. What you need to look for are instruction set extensions, such as SSE and AVX, that are relevant to the things you do. ARM CPUs have far higher IPC, but because they use a RISC ISA, rather than the CISC x86-64, the real world performance is lower. Really though, in desktop gaming, all you're going to use is the x86-64, and the instruction set extensions won't matter that much.
How about the Sony Walkman NWZ-F886 (German link, can't find it on international homepage)? It is a full Android device minus the phone function.  Itâ€™s a low- to mid-range Android device. It has 32 GB of space and should be good for playing music and videos. One bad thing about itâ€¦ it has a rather low screen resolution (854 Ã— 480 pixels).  I looked up the price of the device, which is quite high (around 300â‚¬). To be honest, I would recommend a phone in airplane mode over this, but if you just want a device without phone functionality, this is one of your options.
There is quite a list actually, not popular since mp3 player's market is going down, even the latest iPod was at a competitive price (according to apple standards). I'd go with the samsung galaxy player 5, has a better batery life and more functionalities (needed or not) and a microSD extension slot. next would be walkman Z series, much shorter battery life, but the walkman sound quality.  source: http://www.geckoandfly.com/10095/ipod-touch-alternatives-sony-walkman-vs-samsung-galazy-vs-philips-gogear/  Nevertheless it'd be better to get a good phone and ignore the sim fonctions.
I will answer my own question.  I ended up buying a SanDisk extreme plus micro SDHC 16 GB (20â‚¬). OSMC runs more than smoothly on it.  16 GB seems to be a good size. OSMC takes less than 300 MB but the metadata, thumbnails, artworks and add-ons are also stored on the SD card. I'm able to play my heaviest movies (20 GB) through NFS without issue.  Any card with the same R/W speed should do the trick.
I am currently using the Asus Maximus Ranger vii motherboard.     It is great for the price and has alot of overclocking features which are very easy to use. I am also running this with the Intel i5 4690K, as @Niklas Holm mentions there will be a very low chance of another LGA 1150 CPU being released.  However, some investigation has been carried out on the performance differences between the Haswell CPUs and Skylake, and they show minimal increase in performance. So I definately think that for the next 3 years at least this set up will do you fine.  This Mobo is priced at around $150-$200, usually towards the upper end.(Being replaced by Ranger viii for Z170 so prices will drop)  Another choice is the [Asus Z97 - PRO Gamer][3] which is another solid choice, however with less overclocking features. This is priced at $150 on amazon.
I own Dell 5548 and it has a Full HD touchscreen, a very good quality screen, I'm very pleased with it as a Web Designer and as a Developer. Of course, its color reproduction is not perfect, but quite decent.  The only negative issue I can point out is the bad battery life with Windows 10 (4 hours instead of 6 with Win 8.1). Ah and if you carry around the laptop with the lid closed in the backpack you would have the marks from the keyboard on the display.
I recommend the Gigabyte F2A88XM-D3H, which is an A88X motherboard, which should offer most of the modern features, with 4 RAM slots, which means an upgrade path to 32 GB of DDR3, and 4+2 phases which makes for decent overclocking headroom. The more expensive Gigabyte G1.SNIPER or Asrock Extreme6 bring only limited benefit, except more bells and whistles.  I must admit the budget isn't nearly as restrictive as I initially thought, since you intend to reuse your GPU, which is the most expensive part of a gaming system, and you would likely have money to spare for extras like a Windows licence or a SSD. You don't quite have enough for an i5 though, which is the next step up on the intel side, and I hesitate to recommend the AM3+ platform, so if you have any leftover budget, I suggest you save it up for your GPU, or get a better cooler.  The motherboard supports the Athlon 860K, though if it ships with a old revision of the BIOS , you may have to send it back to get it flashed with a F6 or later. Be sure to communicate with the store to see if they'll do it for you.  Motherboards these days don't generally come with integrated graphics. If you want one, you'll have to spend â‚¬20-40 pounds extra for an APU. Those will perform worse because of the shared TDP, but with DX12, they may be able to help out a bit.
Your usage should be around 380-390W actually. Technically speaking the 400W PSU should be enough but you'd better have more headroom a PSU of 450W at the least and 550W to be futur proof.
As others have pointed out, most touchscreen Android MP3 players have been discontinued due to the vast majority of people owning smartphones. However, there are a few you can find.    This is marketed as a "tablet", but it only has a 4.3" screen - smaller than most modern cell phones. It runs Android 4.0, and has an SD slot to upgrade the capacity (it looks like to 32GB). However, it has fairly slow internals, and does not come with the Google play store, just the Amazon App Store. There are a handful of similar "tablets" avaliable on Amazon as well. There are a couple of Android Sony Walkmans out there, but they are very expensive,  because they are aimed at more audiophiles than regular users. There is an  older version for sale as well, but it appears to have never been sold in the US and is only avaliable post-import.   I would have to go along with the others and recommend a phone inactivated. You should be able to get an older "flagship" model (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S3/4, LG G2/3,etc) for a couple hundred dollars, or go for a lower-end android for about $100ish. With the decrease in demand for phone-sized  Android MP3 players, the options are just not much to choose from.
As you seem like a developer, a perfect fit for you would be any flavor of an Arduino. It is an easily programmable development controller with a massive backing of the maker community. This would allow you to take many inputs (skin sensors) and measure the voltage from 0-5v in 1024 steps, giving you 0.005v precision. This may not be precise enough, but a simple transistor can be used to amplify that signal (only a transistor and arduino is needed, no other circuitry unless you really want to go all out). Arduinos can be as small as your thumb or smaller and can even communicate over wifi using a shield. Cost is very cheap and the possibilities are endless. Because arduinos run simple code, you can set thresholds for flex strength, variables, and conditions that would not only allow you to click, but you can move your mouse precisely. This is much more powerful than the Makey Makey. You could probably get an official EEG, but that wouldn't give you the flexibility or functionality you need.
I would suggest to go with Lenovo Thinkpad (previously known as the IBM Thinkpad). It's worth with the price as its durable. I have one friend who's a developer and he used it for a long time even with less configuration than what you have described above.  I bought my MacBook Pro in 2010 and works fine so far. No issues at all. I am using it to develop websites and a couple of personal projects. I use almost the same applications as what you're using except the Android thing. Use GIT, Netbeans, Adobe suite, FTP, etc. If I want to buy a new laptop at this stage, I would definitely go with the Thinkpad.  My brother and good friend of mine had a Dell Inspiron, and they got f'ed up within a year.  Good luck with your search and purchase.
Apparently the solution is one of two possible options.  There is a DisplayPort standard called Multi-Stream Transport (MST) that was introduced with DisplayPort 1.2 (Wikipedia, n.d.).  The other option is a display with a VGA in/out configuration.  LG makes a series of monitors that provides this function, the N225WU-BN Cloud monitor, which is designed for use with Microsoft Multipoint Server 2011, but serves the purpose for this application (N225WU-BN, n.d.).   I wanted to thank SSumner for the DisplayPort research direction.  References   DisplayPort. (n.d.).

The only difference between the two machines you have listed is a dedicated video card in the first one. Unless you are doing something that requires a video card (games come to mind, but there are other areas that would require it too), I'd go with the second.  An i7 CPU with 8 GB of RAM should be sufficient for your needs. The 1TB hard drive will give you plenty of space to work with as well. The 15.6" screen will put the machine on the large side for a laptop, but if you know that ahead of time you won't be surprised. This isn't going to be a light machine to carry around though.  The biggest difference - not hardware-wise - is the after purchase support of the machines. You'll need to compare warranties and how much you are willing to spend on a warranty between the two retailers.  Leaving out the warranty cost though, if you are not in need of a dedicated video card, go with the Dell.
I would recommend the Arduino.   Arduino chips are absolutely the way to go! The Arduino MEGA uses the ATmega16U2 chip and meets all of your requirements. It can easily run on USB power or less.

No, I wouldn't buy either of those laptops, because the displays are too low-resolution for me to be able to work productively.  My minimum recommended specs for software development would be as follows:   Minimum $800 price point, preferably $1200 or more--I've bought a lot of laptops, and if you go any cheaper the manufacturers seriously have to start cutting corners and it really shows. Full HD or better resolution (1920x1080) 256 GB or larger SSD 16 Gb RAM (or 8 GB upgradeable to 16 GB) good keyboard, preferably with a numpad good battery life excellent touchpad (Macbook one is the best, maybe some PC touchpads have gotten better)   If you don't get an SSD right off the bat, budget to upgrade within a few months. The performance difference is unbelievable and you'll be able to be much more productive with an SSD.  I'd even suggest upgrading to an SSD before upgrading your RAM to 16 GB.  I cannot recommend a specific model, but I can make a few general recommendations...  DO NOT BUY:   Toshiba Anything less than $800 on sale   DO CONSIDER:   Macbook/Macbook Pro Samsung Dell Asus Lenovo Thinkpad Preferably something $1200 or up   For software development, pretty much any modern graphics chip will be more than adequate.  Your resistance to buying a Macbook is understandable, but as a die-hard Windows power user since 1995, I have to grudgingly admit that the Mac touchpad is best-in-class, and the gestures and swiping left and right between full-screen apps is a huge productivity booster.
I'm not sure about dedicated MP3 players but you can buy any cheap prepaid Android phone and use the app of your preference.  I really like DoggCatcher, but there are many other podcast apps to choose from.  I recently bought a $15 LG something-or-other prepaid Verizon phone and use it exclusively for podcasts and using email over WiFi.  Some headphones have additional controls which can control your media player app.

Purpose-built Linux distros have gotten very user-friendly in recent years.  You can use a Raspberry Pi with HiFi audio running RuneAudio.  No coding or even any Linux command-line required.  If your friend doesn't want to do the small amount of tinkering to assemble the hardware and install the OS, maybe it's something you would have fun doing, and perhaps your friend would be interested in helping or watching.
I use OpenELEC on a dedicated computer, and have also set it up for a friend on a Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi 2 is highly recommended as the extra processing ability makes a big difference). It is a distribution based around Kodi, a home theatre software system.  It is designed to "just work", and doesn't require any knowledge of Linux or coding to use. It isn't even particularly obvious that it is running on Linux, as it boots straight into Kodi. Installation is simply a matter of downloading the correct image and writing it onto a SD card which you then insert in the Raspberry Pi. You will have to do some tinkering of the settings within Kodi to get it to operate how you want it, but this would be the case with any solution, unless you are happy with the defaults.  In addition to playing movies and TV shows, it also handles music quite nicely. You will have to make sure that your audio files are tagged correctly if you want all the bells and whistles (as with any player), but you can also choose to play from files directly. If you do put in the tagging effort, then it will automatically display pictures and descriptions of the bands and album covers.  I have mine hooked up to a projector (for movies/TV), as well as a monitor (for music), and a range of different control devices to suit my mood (wireless keyboard, mouse, remote).  Additionally, I have an app called Yatse on my Android phone from which I can control everything over WiFi if I don't want to have any of the above devices turned on. It even lets me save multiple Kodi instances so I can control my friend's system when I'm at his house.  I personally don't have any Apple products, but this app or this one look like viable alternatives to Yatse for an iPad.
I will first focus on compatability. On the Newegg Page for the MOBO:     1 x ATX 24-pin power connector      1 x ATX 4-pin 12V CPU power connector   These are standard ATX PSU Connectors that can be found on every ATX-Compatible Power Supply. However, the power supply that you chose is considered not that good in the PC Building Community. At that same price-point ($45), I would recommend the SeaSonic M12II 520 as it is made by a manufacturer with a good reputation and even though it is more expensive, it will be able to put out a full 500W which the Corsair unit would not be able to.
You might consider looking for a used point of sale system.  I've played with PARs, Microses, and Alohas and have never had any trouble with Debian.  Even the touchscreens generally work with out of the box installations. Certainly not as fuel efficient as a Pi (though POSes do still use processors designed for efficiency rather than performance), but definitely a little more robust. They also depreciate VERY quickly.  You can get one with decent processing power for cheap on the ebay, and parts for the more popular models are usually plentiful.
You want a KVM over IP device.   Something similar to TRIPP LITE B055-001, would work (assuming, in this case, the server has PS/2 ports for the keyboard and mouse). This model is about $120.    There are USB enabled ones as well, such as the StarTech SV5USBM, which has only one USB connection. Adding on more connectors raises the price from about $100 to almost $320  Note: I've not used these specific devices. They appear to be marketed toward consumers, directly, versus the KVMIP devices I've used in a data center that cost between $2-3K each.
A brief calculation from a power calculator puts that build at needing around 600W of power (I made some assumptions about memory type and number of fans, as well as optical drives).   In that case, I recommend Corsair's AX760, again. This is above what should be required, giving you room to expand your components at a later date.    It also is 80 Plus Platinum certified It is fully modular (only use cables you need) It is quiet It has a 7 year warranty  If the 760W is to close to the 600W you will need, it has a larger 860W version available for just a bit more.   It retails for $190, but is on sale on Newegg for $150 right now.
First of all, I would make sure that you aren't circumventing any policies by using hardware rather than software, but I'll assume that the powers that be simply don't want you installing things on those laptops. It sounds like you are looking for an IP KVM or KVM over IP.  The cost of such hardware may be more than you are hoping, but I think these available options are worth mentioning anyway.    Since you have to pay so much for two of the below-mentioned "Lantronix Spiders", I will start with an 8-port option such as TRIPP LITE 8-Port Steel Rackmount IP KVM Switch with On-Screen Display (B022-U08-IP), which is currently just over $600 at Amazon.  It comes with cables to connect two devices, and, unlike some other 8-port products, the IP capabilities are built in, so you don't have to buy two pieces of hardware.  On similar products, I have found that the software leaves a little to be desired, but it gets the job done.  Like the Lantronix, this device is transparent to the machine you connect it to, so there is no need to install software there.  I would recommend this device above the Lantronix if you have the space and cash because:   It remotely supports resolutions up to 1600 x 1200 You can add more devices if needed (extra cables are usually available for ~$12 each new) Included cables are 6ft long, so you may be able to hide the 1U device under a desk. Although you may never use this, the device can also be used as a local KVM switch (supporting up to 2048 x 1536). speculation:This box may still have some resell value in a few years.   One caveat for this device (or any other KVM that functions this way) is that, since you are accessing a laptop, you will need VGA out on the laptop, and you will probably want to close the lid or set the laptop to mirror or exclusively use the external "VGA monitor" (the KVM switch) in order to make this work properly.  Otherwise, you won't see everything the laptop is displaying, if you see anything at all.  With any of the options I am recommending, you must connect the network port to the network, not the laptop.  Additionally, in order to access any of these devices from outside of the local network, you will need either a VPN or port forwarding.    For your purposes, I would also recommend you consider something like the Lantronix Spider SLS200USB0-01, currently available at Newegg for USD278.99.     This device is transparent to the machine you connect it to, so there is no need to install software there. It has a built in two-port switch, so you can daisy-chain two of these together with only one network drop Only supports resolutions of up to 1280 x 1024 Less expensive than some other options   The same display/VGA and networking caveats apply to this device, though, because there is a 2-port switch built in, if you only have one network drop in the room, you can plug it into this device and pass through to another device if needed.  Also, since you have two laptops you need to reach, you will need two of these.  I should also mention that I have not personally used this product.    Since other options are pricy, I think it is worth mentioning that my first instinct was to recommend the StarTech.com IPUSB2VGA (StarTech Product Page). As of this writing, it is available on Amazon for $117.93; the MSRP is USD181.99. While my experiences with StarTech products have been good, and the price for this device is not bad, I can't recommend this to you because:   This device seems to require software to function properly, so it may not fit your purpose for that reason, depending upon the specifics of the policies you are dealing with. Due to limitations in the client software, you cannot access this device from another subnet, which means it won't work for you if you need to access it from the Internet (though it might be possible through a VPN, depending upon the configuration).   Having said that, this device might be attractive in certain cases because:   It's inexpensive. It acts as a video and audio adapter and doesn't require VGA out. Supports up to 1920 x 1080   I have not personally used this particular device, but it will send your USB, video, and audio signals over the network, allowing you to access them from a remote PC.  I would recommend using a gigabit connection for best results, though this won't matter as much if you can get it to work over WAN (through the Internet, probably using a VPN).
FWIW I run the following config in my living room:   Case: RAIDMAX Element ATX-101BG Mobo: some mini-itx board, AsRock maybe? CPU: i5-4690 GPU: GTX 970 Reference SSD: 240GB Corsair GS HDD: Western Digital Black 2TB Fans: stock CPU fan, large fan at top of case Memory: 16GB @ 1866 PSU: CORSAIR CX series CX500M   Using Kill-A-Watt meter, if my memory serves me right then I peaked around 350 watts when I tortured it with Prime95 and FurMark at the same time.  CPU: 90Â°C, GPU 80Â°C  I play Witcher 3 on max settings with hairworks set to 2xAA for hours on end.  CPU: 70Â°C, GPU 80Â°C  If I have a larger case then there would definitely be room for better cooling but I never intend to OC and Prime95 is a highly edge-case temperature scenario.  Idle temps, cool as a cucumber:  CPU: 35Â°C, GPU: 35Â°C
The minimum requrment for Fallout 4 is a i5-2300 and the recommended is a i7-4970k. The current recomendation on PC Building Communities is to go with either the i5-4690k or the i5-6600k. These two are almost equal in gaming performance, but the 6600K is newer and runs on a new socket and technology.   The best recommendation is a 6600K on the Z170 platform for overclocking. Just be sure to get a CPU Cooler as the 6600K doesn't include one. Also be sure to get DDR4 Ram.   If you are upgrading and already have a LGA1150 Processor, just go with the i5-4690K on the Z97 Platform, which uses DDR3.
I went to my Guitar Center and talked with one of the drum techs and decided on the Alesis Crimson Mesh Kit based on the level of customization provided at the price given. This kit gives me the feel of an acoustic drum set with the added ability to make my own sounds while having room to expand. I noticed that it also has both USB and MIDI outputs so this will help out with either editing my live drum sessions on the computer or plug this setup into an adapter for Rock Band.
Most home/consumer gateway devices (commonly called routers) will not be able to handle this volume of traffic.  One alternative to consider is products from Ubiquiti Networks as they have several that should fit your need and the prices compare with consumer type products (there are others besides what I list, check their site if you want more detail).   EdgeRouter Lite - I have used these at several non-profit sites, they work well and at about $100 you can't go too far wrong. EdgeRouter X - a bit lower performance (still up to 1Gbps with 1518 byte packets) at about half the cost as the above. I haven't used these personally, but I understand the underlying software is a bit different. Unifi Security Gateway - similar performance specs to the EdgeRouter Lite, but managed through their Unifi controller software (provided free but meant to run on a computer/server). I haven't used this Unifi product, but have deployed access points from the line.   None of these products have wireless built in, for that you would need to look at alternatives such as turning your current router into an access point or buying access points.  All of them may have more features and be more complex than your typical home or consumer device, so the learning curve may be new if you aren't familiar with networking.  Speaking for the EdgeRouter Lite which I have used, it does have a GUI and some wizards for basic configuration, but to unlock all the possible features/configuration you many need to delve into the command line interface (CLI). This has become less true over the life of the product as they continue to develop it, but will always likely be true for some features.  In the plus column, Ubiquiti has a very active user community that is very helpful if you have questions or problems.
I would recommend a resistive touch screen for outdoor/rugged devices. Resistive touch screens uses two sheets of non conductive material with conductive material in between the two sheets. When the sheet is pressed, a current is allowed through and a touch is registered. Unlike capacitive touch screens (found on most smartphones/tablets these days) it is more durable and can be used with gloved hands. The downside to this is that it is not super precise and will need calibration from time to time.
I would say to get a Intel Pentium G3258 and a Mini ITX motherboard with the LGA 1150 socket. 8GB of the cheapest DDR3 RAM would work.
Integrated GPU's will never be as good as a dedicated graphics card because of the space constraint: when the GPU is integrated with the CPU, there is far less space for the GPU to fit into, so not as much graphics processing power can fit in it.  I believe the HD 4600 is two generations above what I have in my laptop, the HD 4400. My graphics card is suitable for playing old games (~7 years) on high settings, or for playing games that aren't graphics-intensive on OK settings. It will not play modern games like Fallout 4, Just Cause 3 or GTA V.  If you're looking into building a dedicated gaming platform, I would highly recommend that you get a dedicated graphics card. If you want to future-proof your system, get something top of the range. If you want a balance between future proofing and cost, I'd recommend something like the Nvidia GTX 970 or the AMD R9-280.
The answer is "it depends".  The Tomshardware graphics hierarchy places your 9600 GT seven steps above a HD 4600, where three steps is the minimum worthwhile upgrade.  However, the hierarchy is strictly about pixel-pushing ability.  Your 9600 GT only supports DirectX 10 and OpenGL 2.1, and doesn't support OpenCL at all.  In contrast, the integrated GPU supports DirectX 12, OpenGL 4.3, and OpenCL 1.2.  If you're doing things that require the new functionality (say, playing newly-released games), it doesn't matter that the 9600 is much faster than the 4600: the 9600 is simply unable to do what's needed of it.
The Arduino is probably one of the best options out there. Another board that you might find interesting is the SimpleLink Wi-FI CC3200 Launchpad. You can program the board via two ways, which are Code Composer Studio (CCS) by TI and Energia (which is basically an Arduino IDE fork). There is a MOD version of this board, but the only major difference is that some of the passives are integrated into a module (helpful if you plan to spin a PCB based on this MCU at a later stage).  Both of them are free to use, and depending on your background in embedded systems, you might find CCS rather helpful in fine tuning it to what you want. As for the sleep modes, I think you have 4 power modes to work with, so low power should not be a problem.  Links:  http://www.ti.com/tool/cc3200-launchxl  http://www.ti.com/product/cc3200  EDIT:  Sorry for not being more detailed on the MCU. Here are some of the highlights of this MCU:  ARM Cortex-M4 Core at 80 MHz   - Embedded Memory Options   Integrated Serial RAM (up to 256KB) Peripheral Drivers in ROM Hardware Crypto Engine for Advanced Hardware Security Including AES, DES, and 3DES SHA and MD5 CRC and Checksum 8-Bit, Fast, Parallel Camera Interface 1 Multichannel Audio Serial Port (McASP)   Interface With Support for I2S Format  â€“ 1 SD (MMC) Interface  â€“ 32-Channel Micro Direct Memory Access (Î¼DMA)  â€“ 2 Universal Asynchronous Receivers/Transmitters (UARTs)  â€“ 2 Serial Peripheral Interfaces (SPIs)  â€“ 1 Inter-integrated Circuit (I2C)  â€“ 4 General-Purpose Timers (GPTs)  â€“ 16-Bit Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) Mode  â€“ 1 Watchdog Timer Module  â€“ 4-Channel 12-Bit Analog-to-Digital Converters  (ADCs)  â€“ Up to 25 Individually Programmable GPIO Pins  It is a 32 bit ARM processor, but it can definitely do pretty low power stuff. This is the datasheet for the CC3200MOD. http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cc3200mod.pdf  Current consumption numbers are on page 27.
I recommend the Dell Inspiron 15 5000  Specs   Quad-core AMD A8-7410 CPU Windows 10 Home 64 bit 6GB RAM 128GB SSD No dGPU, uses an APU 768p screen
The only professional tool I know of that somewhat fits this need is the Fluke Networks LinkSprinter. The general operation is that they provide the results to the cloud service (and/or email), but you can can connect to them wirelessly and view the results in a web browser. The 200 and 300 models also have an Android application.  Now, I will say that these are not certification testers, so if you need to certify cable results these won't suffice. They provide testing that is essentially a client test, connectivity and ability to get DHCP and ping devices.  However they do go a bit further as they can test PoE, provide information based on CDP/LLDP/EDP, and (in the case of the 300 model) detect link fault (open or short).  They also only do copper, so no capability to test fiber.  While probably not a perfect replacement for their current testers, if the majority of the work the techs do is validation of connectivity over copper these might work with the need to use a larger/more expensive tester necessary only on rare occasions.  These are also sold in 5 and 10 packs to help lower costs.
They will both work perfectly for you since you're focused on developping.  the i7 4th gen is a bit of an overkill for your needs. It'd be suitable if you intend to do photo/video editing and other cpu heavy stuff. the i5 of 4th gen and onwards will be more than enough for you needs. the only thing to look out for is "chrome with a lots of tabs open", you're gonna need a lot of memory for that. 8gb recommended if you're the type to get more than 20tabs at the same time while using visual studios
I would go with the HAVITÂ® HV-MS672 Ergonomic LED Stress-ease Wired Mouse from Amazon.  $10 (+) Normal mouse (+) Wired (+) Great for mousepads (smooth back surface) (+) Ergonomic (according to HAVIT ) (+)    Some bonuses: 6 led lights (warning:  cannot change to specific color )  (+) Back/foward button (+)  DPI button (ideal for gaming with 4 options) (+)   I'm ordering this mouse tomorrow so I may update soon.
Recommendations  There are many different mesh networks I have seen being set up with the Arduino. Here I name just a few of the common ones.   Pinoccio   According to the website,      Field Scouts talk to each other using a mesh network (called a Troop), using an extremely low-power radio. This makes them 14 times more efficient than standard WiFi devices. Slap a WiFi backpack on a Scout to make it the Lead Scout, and connect your entire Troop to the web!   This allows the data to be shared onto the Internet.  The Radio of the Field Scout is over 2.4GHz using 802.15.4. I am pretty sure it will work in an open room. However the problem is you might have to redo all of the Arduino setup on the Pinoccio, but it is Arduino-compatible.   RF24Mesh   It seems to be an easy to use library for Arduino, which you use when you attach a nRF24L01 to each of the Arduinos. However, there isn't much documentation.
Nowadays, many tablets have the same, or more, performance than laptops.The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 is a very good option for portability and performance. It has a beautiful screen, a powerful processor and a generally well built device.
I would recommend the Razer Deathadder. It is slightly expensive ($60) but it has a very comfy design, a well built software with 2 fully programmable macro buttons and a strong build quality. This is the mouse I'm using right now as my gaming gear. There is also cool looking green backlight.
You will get more performance from the 4th gen i7 over the 5th gen i5. But that performance comes at a price. Assuming you have the same other hardware, the 4th gen i7 will produce more heat and have shorter battery life then 5th gen i5.   5th gen i5 should have enough performance for you.
Having a Xeon processor allows the use of ECC memory which is sometimes critical for some workloads. You would loose performance for some general purpose but gain a lot more for specialized purposes such as virtualization compared to an i7.  For programming, I would recommend the i7. But because you are doing Premiere and 3D, I would go for the Xeon.
I would say if you have that much budget, go for it!  The GTX Titan X ($1,000), is probably not what you want, probably a better alternative is 2-way SLI GTX 980 Ti (~$1300).  If you have issues with SLI (I doubt you will with only 2 way), you can always just use one of them when playing games.  Using the SLI with Blender and probably those other render engines, is most likely going to work beautifully. I know for a fact that Blender does not even require SLI to use two cards    Benchmarks (BF4 4K):  SLI GTX 980 Ti - 67fps One Titan X - 40fps One GTX 980 Ti - 37fps    As you can see, if you don't like SLI, you can just turn it off and still get Titan X like performance. As for 3D rendering, you won't have any issues with SLI, trust me.
This is a rather vague question, but I will do my best to answer it. A budget of $5000 will bring you a long way. My recommendation is a Microsoft Surface Book. Without knowing what the "same performance of standard notebooks" is I can almost guarantee that the this insanely powerful Tablet/Laptop hybrid will fit your needs. You could probably also play some video games on it. It ranges from $1500 - $3200 and goes from an i5 with iGPU & 128GB SSD to an i7 with dGPU & 1TB SSD.  Would definitely run 6 Chrome tabs, Excel, PowerPoint, and email at the same time.
I would suggest Dell XPS 13 family, ex. XPS 13 Non-Touch, or with touch, if needed. It has great screen with ultra thick borders, and for the applications you specify, the screen is important, not the internals - what I mean, that every new laptop nowedays is designed to run flawlessly in common scenarions (which is what you specified). Do not go for internals (i5/i7, 1333/1600Mhz RAM etc. dillemas), go for design you like, touch-non-touch, screen size and quality, and usablity - keybord may come in handy if you use MS office much.
I would actually not recommend either of the platforms that you had in mind, and go with the LGA 1151 Skylake Processors. These require DDR4 RAM and are the newest CPUs that Intel has released. For what you are doing, I would recommend the i7-6700K, that costs $350. Also with 1x8GB of DDR4 RAM would be expandable and enough for now. The Motherboard that I would recommend is the Z170 PRO GAMING, as it would allow for major overclocking when paired with a CPU Cooler, such as the EVO 212. If you do not want to overclock, I would recomend the i5-6500 or the i7-6700 with a H170 Mobo.
The LGA 2011 platform and the LGA 1151 platform is designed for two different markets. The LGA 1151 is a mainstream consumer socket, designed for CPU's ranging from $100 - $350. The LGA 2011 socket is for the extreme enthusiast and prosumer purposes. CPU's for the LGA 2011 socket is around $400 - $1200 (please note that the $400 5820K only has 28 PCI-E lanes).  Which one to choose depends on what your purpose is. If you're going to do normal day to day tasks, the LGA 1151 platform is enough. If you are doing to do prosumer things like video editing and 3D modeling, a LGA 2011 socket would be better.  In terms of "future extensibility", none of them are good at it. Intel tends to release a new socket for each generation so to upgrade you would need to get a new board.
This would work fine for Eclipse and Android Studio. The only minor issue would be if you tried to run the Android emulator in Android Studio it might be slow since the computer only have 4GB of RAM. I would recommend at lease 6GB of RAM for better performance.
The only available option that I could find was OwnFone     It's a customized phone that is made specially for the customer based on their order. They company intention is to provide our elders with an emergency easy to use phone however, it can be used a for children as well   Buttons can be images (or names) in case you child is too young to read 999/emergency button is available  No text, no screen Choices of 2, 4, 8 or 12 pre-programmed numbers depending on how much you willing to pay Designed and works only in the UK   Biggest downside is that the phone is not SIM-free and it seems you cant even replace the SIM or the battery so you are stuck with the plans offered to you by the company.  The cell phone can be bought from this website  Edit: It's available for children now from Mobile phones for children
I recommend a GTX 550 Ti  Features   Maximum res: 2560x1600 Minimum Fallout 4 requirements Supports CUDA MRSP: $150 ($100 to spare!)
I personally would recommend getting a EVGA GTX 970 ACX 2.0+. You can find those around 300$ maybe even less. I have owned that card and I was quite happy with the performance and the support. You can also find other GTX 970 cards around that price range. Just check some benchmarks/temps/noise levels and see what you like.  The problem is that the GTX 970 "only" has 4GB (3.5GB) of VRAM. Similar models like the Radeon R9 390 already have 8GB of VRAM which considering more and more complex textures in the future, might be a safer choice.
After reading your question, I'd highly recommend a better screen atleast a 1080p screen (about a $100 or less if you find a deal)  As for the graphic card the GTX 970 is dominating at that resolution with the curent drivers. the competition will get tougher once amd updates theirs for this game. You could potentially get similar performances on the r9 290 which is cheaper.  Wait for the amd drivers for fallout 4 to come out and see if the r9 290 comes close to 60fps at 1080p resolution (ultra settings ofcourse), if it does then go for it, if it doesn't then go with the gtx 970 (any would do so pick the cheapest acording to your reseller) and a better screen ASAP.  On the other hand if you plan on keeping the monitor than a 950ti would be more than enough for that resolution.
That resolution is pretty easy to drive. I'd actually consider a newer monitor, even if my experience, eizos are pretty nice.   At the current resolution, and in fact up to QHD, a 960 would likely be a good bet - my old 660 with 2gb of ram handled 1080p out fine at ultra settings for most games I threw it at.  A 970 would likely be overkill, and of course, a 980 or 980TI would be more so.  Get a better video card if you intend to upgrade.
I am not sure how a $800 graphics card would go in a $1500 computer. One can technically buy it, but without a good motherboard, powersupply, CPU, RAM, HDD, and most importantly a case, it's just going to be a super expensive paperweight.  For $1500, assuming you spend two-thirds of the budget for the rest of the build, a GTX 980 would be a good bet. You can find one from EVGA for $510: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814487079  The rest of the build could include a i5 4690K/6600K, a Z97/Z170 based motherboard, a 650W power supply, 16GB RAM and a 250GB/1TB SSD/HDD combo. Plus a CPU cooler, a good case and a couple of case fans.  If you're looking for a lot of tasks beyond simple gaming, a i7 4790k/6700k would also be a good idea.
Maybe:   Lenovo G50-80 with ex. i7-5500U/16GB/240 SSD Dell Inspiron 5548 i5-5200U/8GB/128SDD+500HDD if you do not like wasting money on DVD (well over the budget, good graphics) ASUS R556LJ-XO603D-8 i3-5005U/8GB/128SSD+1TB GF920 (well under the budget, good graphics)
Ultra graphics performance for a penny  As this is your requirement I don't think that the graphics card which are recommended until now will statisfy your future self.      I'd like to future proof, also I'd like to buy in the future new monitor, thouh I'm not sure when.   A new monitor sure is a good idea in the near future. My following config aims to provide as much power as possible in my eyes for a reasonable price.    Intel Core i5-6500   A new Skylake processor to make your build future proof -    MSI Z170-A Pro Corsair Vengeance LPX DIMM Kit 16GB, DDR4-3000   Super fast RAM - 16GB because why not? We want to be future proof right?   Sapphire Radeon R9 390 Nitro + Backplate   Great graphics card in my opinion - really good performance - performance lies between the GTX970 and the GTX980 for around 350 bucks. I know that you wanted to buy a GTX 970 because you wanted to program for CUDA but when you really want the best performance for the best price your choice should be the R9 390. Alternatively you can use the GTX 970 if CUDA is absolutely necessary.   be quiet! Shadow Wings SW1 Mid-Speed 140mm   Case fan for a good airflow.   EKL AlpenfÃ¶hn Ben Nevis   Solid CPU FAN - should keep your cpu cool enough from day to day.   Phanteks Enthoo Pro M be quiet! Straight Power 10-CM 500W Seagate Desktop HDD 1TB   That makes 1022-â‚¬ where I am from so it should be ~1100$.     An i5 4460 would still be enough in most cases but if you want to be futureproof then a Skylake build won't hurt. Positive thing is that you can still enjoy your games in 1920x1080 resolution as modern cards support VSR/DSR.      This technology allows a user to improve visual quality in games and other content by rendering at a very high resolution (up to 4K) and then displaying that content at a lower resolution supported by the available monitor.    What Is Virtual Super Resolution and How Does It Work?.
I guess it depends on your definition of comfortably handle. In my opinion none of these models will comfortably handle a modern game.   Having said that, there are users that are currently running games like Fallout 4 on the i5 8GB version (LINK) at 1280x720 and it seems to be doing fine.(Other users say the game constantly crashes or won't even start.)  Just be prepared that you will only be able to run the game at the lowest possible settings. If you don't mind all of that as well as the occasional frame rate drop in graphic intensive areas go for the i5 8GB 256GB SSD version.   I personally wouldn't get that laptop if I was planing on playing newer games. It just wasn't made for that.  Response to a comment:  In general it comes down to the fact that laptops have significantly lower power supplies than desktops which in return limits the CPU and GPU a laptop can power. I am afraid that pretty much every gaming laptop has this flaw.  Even the most expensive Surface Pro 4 is not going to give you smooth gaming performance now and certainly not in 2-3 years. If you occasionally want to play some FIFA 16 or Dota 2 while you are on a business trip I think the Surface Pro 4 will be just fine. If you plan on playing newer games like Call of Duty and Fallout 4, I don't think you will enjoy that. Constantly playing at the lowest resolutions with <50 fps is not going to be fun in the long run. At least it wouldn't be for me. Hope that helps.
If you are making a true workstation with fast speeds(so not for gaming) but for working with unreal 4 and DirectX 12, I would go with a Titan X because of the RAM benefit and the double float point RAM so you can be sure your not going to get RAM corruption while you are building your game world. I would not pick a socked 1151 but an 2011-3 because the capability for more RAM and RAM disks because I would think speed is your game.   If you are going to game on it hardcore, I would pick the SLI GTX 980ti setup because its just faster at pushing the pixels for gaming. For the ones who think 6GB + 6GB = 12GB so more RAM that is not how it works. Then I would go with the socked 1151 because it's cheaper and you don't need 64GB of DDR4 for gaming.   Unreal 4 and Unity 4.X do NOT support Sli
Upgrading your GPU  Guessing at your budget, I'm going to recommend a R9 380, or GTX 960. Both are pretty equal cards, and the GTX 960 pulls ahead in nVidia optimized games but I'm not going to go into that. Upgrading to either will be an extreme improvement to your current GPU. (Benchmarks)  Upgrading CPU  If you are looking to upgrade your CPU, which in my opinion you don't really need to do, I would recommend something along the lines of the i5-6600K, because of the 14nm architecture, higher IPC, and newer chipset. Unfortunately, upgrading your CPU would require you to upgrade your motherboard to Z170. I'm not going to write a motherboard recommendation as well.  Upgrade RAM (Don't)
It could work but i wouldn't recommend it.   First of all this will void your warrenty, second most laptops are not made to be upgraded. most laptops have there CPU and GPU soldered to the motherboard.  you may get heat issuse and you cooler might break or not bend back proberly if done wrong. I don't think you can buy mobile CPU's on the consummer marked. maybe you should consider to upgrade to a new laptop. I personaly have a Gs60 Ghost from MSI and its great.  If you want your pc to be a bit faster maybe try installing an SSD.  If the TDP is the same and you are good in removing tiny screw and appying maybe some silicon glue you may be able to do it. as of drivers that shoulden't have to be a problem.I think your motherboard also needs to support it. I'm not a laptop hardware expert so keep that in mind.So keep that in mine.   acoring to intel the CPU is 568.00 dollars wich is expensive in my book for a gamble. if you manage to do it be sure to update this question.    Overall I wouldn't do it.
Like mentioned here on Tomsguide, it won't work because you're dealing with different generations of intel processors (the i7 3XXX series and the older i7 2XXX series) using different types of sockets.   EDIT  (I didn't know you already had an ssd.)  It is possible to upgrade from a second generation i7 to another second generation i7. The performance increase from such a small upgrade is barely noticable and the risks are too high imho.  EDIT2  Here is a list of laptop Passmark scores. Between the i7-2630qm and the i7-2860qm there's a difference of just 1730 points. That's a performance increase of about 30 percent (in real life performance the difference will be smaller, though).  Also can you mention where you generally use your laptop for? gaming, editing, browsing, etc.?
Like qmd said, these aren't meant for gaming. If you really want a Surface Pro 4, I would go with the i5 8GB model, because at this day and age, you need at least 1.5GB for Chrome to run smoothly and a i7 is not needed for the day to day jobs unless you are doing virtualization of any kind or photo/video editing.   I would get a Surface Book which CAN handle modern games. Also it has a keyboard which I prefer to the one that you can get on the Surface Pro 4. The Surface Book starts at $1500 ($1899 for the model with the dedicated GPU) and is a 2 in 1 laptop kind of machine with a video card. There is also a model without the video card, but I would not get that one.  For both models, I would get the Surface Dock ($199.99) for more ports for at home or in a hotel.  It is up to you, but I would get the i5 Surface Book. Here are links for your clicking pleasure to both the Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book.
Trust GXT 166 MMO This is a razer naga style mouse. it has a high grip and 11 buttons on the left side of the mouse. this mouse doesn't have a thump rest but that isnt that bad. it glides okey but not the best. it has a red and black color sceme. has a okey scrolling wheel. it has a weight system and is ofset to the left for a pink rest. it is wired with a red cable it has lights in the scroll wheel and the logo. it also has 2 buttons below the scroll wheel.
Trust GXT31 USB This is from trust wich is a buget computer tech company. This is a smal low profile style mouse. it has 1 LED that can change colour in software. it has 2 macro buttons on the left side of the mouse. had has a button on the top. it has a smooth scrolling scroll wheel but is not analog or free scrolling. it has a rubber texture on the left side of the mouse and a smooth finish on the top sporting a cammo look. it has a infra red sensor.  The software is not bad and easy to use.   This mouse is around 20 euro if you can find it
Logitech MX master  A really nice mouse that is made out of solid metal with a gold and black look. On the left side it has 3 buttons, with one featuring a gesture control. It means that you can do gestures for Windows and custom ones by holding that button. That button is also the thumb rest. Just right above that is a horizontal scrolling wheel and 2 macro buttons.  The scroll wheel can tilt to the left and right and features a smart lock system. It means that when you scroll fast it will unlock and use free scroll. Sensitivity can be changed in software. It also has an unlock button for free scroll.  The software is nice and simple to use with a friendly UI. It isn't wired though.  This mouse cost more than your budget but it is totally worth it. It's 80 to 100 Euros.
Other than hardware issues (whether the CPU is soldered, and whether the socket is the same), software/bios/driver issues should not be a problem if the two CPUs are from the same generation (sometimes it even works with different generations of CPUs).  I've done it on a Thinkpad T61 a few years ago, as well as on a(n old) Mac Mini recently (in both cases upgrading to a Core 2 Duo).  If the CPU is cheap enough (as is the case when the CPU is an old model), I find it's definitely worth the trouble.
I'd go with a standard home router with the following constraints:   supported by OpenWRT. comes with at least one USB port.   then plug a USB-4G dongle into it.  See http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/3gdongle for some info about how to configure OpenWRT for that kind of use.  Which specific router to use will depend on what other features you want it to provide, but if you want a particular recommendation, you could start with the TL-WDR4300, which is reasonably powerful, not too expensive, and fully supported.
The ASUS Sabertooth Z170 Mark I is what you are looking for. It is around $250 but what you are getting is worth the money. First of all, there is a plastic shield on the front for protection against the chips of the motherboard and there is a metal shield on the back to protect against ESD and board flex. The power delivery components are all tested with a military standard and a report sheet with the tests your motherboard passed is included. There are 2 small, but powerful, fans to cool the power delivery components to prevent them from overheating and extending their life span. It also comes with a 5 year warranty (2 more years than the standard boards).
I would suggest a Raspberry Pi. Install a console-only Debian (might need to customize post-install) and you're good to go. Supports USB, Wi-Fi, Ethernet and HDMI. Since you don't list server quality hardware as a requirement, the SoC would probably work well. Finally, it looks nothing like what most people would associate with a computer or tablet, more like a nondescript electronic device.
Check this out: LG Optimus Exceed 2   Android 4.4 1.2Ghz Dual-core CPU 4GB internal memory + microSD card slot 4.5" Screen, 800x400 resolution $20 free shipping on BestBuy   It's prepaid, so not useful for calling, but it can be used for development.
Here are 2 cases that you may be able to use for a double power supply. The Thermaltake Core X9 is a solid metal case meant for pc's with EATX support. it modulair and you can probably fit a dual ATX PSU in.  The IPC 4U-4310L is a server rack with support for a redundant power supply. this also has hot swap ports and is a 4u form factor.  Both are not the cheapest cases that there are in the marked. But I think that in these you can fit your pc.  So if you want a case with no hassle then you can get the Thermaltake Core X9. also this one looks the best and has good ventilation. if you want a rack server you could go with the IPC one but it doesn't support 2 full atx power supplies but a redundant power supply (this means one set of cables etc.)  And if you want to go on the cheap you can mod any cube form factor case to fit your needs.  Overall i would pick the Thermaltake Core x9 because it can have an extra PSU install in at and if you get 2 it can get 4 of the badboys in there. also it's small so you can fit it anywhere with ease wich means hassle free installation.
I'd recommend Intel, they're really reliable, have low power consumption and future-proof if you're into keeping your rig for more than 3-4 years.  AMD has a good performance/price ratio, but are more risky, heat issues and useless cores for marketing.  Pros/Cons    For gaming just rely on a good GPU, the CPU bottle neck is pretty much a myth if you have an i5 2500 or better.  You'd get better performance with a 4th gen Intel CPU and a better GPU. Keep that in mind.
I know that everybody will recommend Intel, except me. However, sometimes Intel is not the best. The price/performance of an i5 6400 vs AMD FX-8350 (I'd recommend looking into the FX-8320E as well, because it is just as well binned as the 8350, but $40 cheaper) is that the FX-8350 is winning, in my opinion  FX-8350   Overclockable Nearly double performance, double cores Higher base clock speed ~$20 cheaper   i5-6400   Higher IPC Slightly higher single-core strength Colder temperature Not based on a dead chipset   Game debate benchmarks    Passmark    Witcher 3 (8350 on the left, i5 4460 on the right)    Keep in mind that this is the 4460, not the 6400 (800Mhz clock difference), and you can also OC the 8350, and match it up with the 4460 quite nicely, meanwhile having 4 threads on deck for whatever, while with the i5, CPU is probably utilized all the time (all four threads)
I would say it would mainly depend on the type of programming you intend on doing. Gaming as a whole isn't CPU intensive so I would disregard that as an issue for the CPU as that will mainly depend on the GPU.  Programming wise, if you plan to work on small self made projects again this wouldn't be an issue as you wouldn't be utilizing the full CPU. If however you were working on a large scale enterprise solution that you had to build and deploy on your local machine that is when a better CPU might come into play.   As an example, a large project ( 100+ projects) written in C# that relies on multiple instances of MSBuild to compile I would recommend an i7, simply for the fact that is has hyper-threading to allow more threads to be run in parallel. If however you were working on less large scale solutions I would go with an i5 as it has more than enough performance to handle most programming and gaming needs.  TLDR: For moderate gaming and programming there would be no noticeable difference performance wise between either CPU.
My opinion is to buy the Intel if you don't care too much about the money.  I had an FX-8150, and I can tell you that the 4 additional cores are not worth it. I did a lot of programming and gaming, and the 8 core were indeed useless, 4 would have sufficed.  In addition, the AMD 8 cores are REALLY hot. The stock fan was noisy as hell, and I frequently hit 80Â°C (175Â°F), with only 1 core at full load (~15% overall). You will need an above average fan.    Now, if you want to buy something cheaper that the Intel, I think it would be better to buy an FX-4350, and not an FX-8350.   Much cheaper Less useless cores A tiny bit higher stock frequency => Very slightly better single core performance. Cooler => easier to overclock   It has the same per-core cache, and the same 8MB L3 cache than the FX-8350. All the other features are the same.  I think it will perform better than the FX-8350 in a real situation, unless you really need 8 cores. The fact that it doesn't have an integrated GPU and use an older technology make it much cheaper than the Intel.  You can also compromise with an FX-6350. With an FX-4350 or 6350, you can spend the extra money on a water-cooling, this will enable higher overclocking and certainly better performance than a 8350.
After some google search, I have found a company which do something similar to what I need. I am not sure if I can find this product in my country. And I also doubt whether their are still in business because they website and products look like out-of-date. I am going to contact with them. Question is still current.  http://www.amazon.com/FlyBook-Advanced-Laptop-Computer-A210914-77F21-511112/dp/B001JI6BP0  http://en.flybook.pl/view/modele  EDIT: If the links go dead keyword for the search is 'Flybook'.
Thank you all for the answers. In the end, I ended up going with the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x's. I was torn between that and the Sony 7506's, which were recommended to me by a sound engineer friend, and I had also had good experiences with in the past. They both meet all of my requirements without a noticeable difference in sound (or price), but the M40's have a replaceable cable, as well as being a little beefier.
I haven't used mumble, (always encrypted communication), before but presumably the incoming audio is available on the headphone socket, (otherwise how could you hear it?).    I expect there is a setting to broadcast your audio locally too.  I spent a lot of effort on this about 5 years ago for a project I can't remember very now.  Anyway something like the following should work:  http://www.startech.com/uk/AV/Converters/Video/usb-3-0-video-capture-device-hdmi-dvi-vga~USB3HDCAP   Seamless picture quality with USB 3.0 bandwidth enabling you to capture 1080p video at 60fps Record from virtually any device, with support for HDMI, DVI, VGA, and Component video input sources Supports 2-channel stereo audio (HDMI / RCA)     I've used lots of startech products, their support is good and they are reliable.
A GTX 750 or a GTX 750 Ti would suit your needs. Buying a GPU better then the GTX 750 Ti would make your CPU a bottleneck and anything lower than a GTX 750 wouldn't satisfy your needs. Try to get a GTX 750 Ti if it's within your budget (it should be), if not, get a GTX 750. The GTX 750 ti would be good enough to run modern games at low settings and less demanding games at medium or high settings.
Since your laptop doesn't natively support link aggregation, you will either have to use software to combine two connections together, or use a external piece of hardware.  To do this in software, you will need to use the onboard LAN and another LAN port (such as a USB to LAN adapter) and then aggregate it together. The advantage of this is that it's cheap but the downsides are many. First of all, this will take a toll on your CPU to do this because your CPU isn't specifically designed to do tasks like this and will use a lot of resources. Secondly, using software link aggregation could be buggy and cause crashes which means downtime from the internet.  A much better solution is to use a external piece of hardware, specifically, a switch that supports link aggregation. You would this connect this switch to your gigabit connection so it would seem like one connection to your computer, but in reality its two. This solves all the downsides of software based aggregation. This has no toll on the CPU and it is very stable. The only downside would be that it isn't very cheap (at least USD$100) to buy a switch with link aggregation.

Even though you don't want/need RAID, you might want JBOD (just a bunch of disks). This technology allows multiple hard drives to act as one huge hard drive, which would be good for things that use up large capacities. You can buy any NAS server products from QNAP, WD, Netgear, Synology, etc. but these usually cost $200+ and they would work fine. If you were tighter budget (me last year) you could buy what I got, the Shuttle Omninas KD20. It has many of the features the $200+ NAS servers has and has great quality. I bought that NAS server for $80 (which is pretty cheap).  Using the Intel NUC isn't great since it isn't cheap, uses more power and doesn't support 24/7 uptime. The RPi doesn't have SATA which means you have to use USB hard drives, these hard drives are more expensive, lower quality and slower than the 2.5"/3.5" counterparts.
"Cartridge" and "Pentium" from 1998 means you've got a Slot 1-based processor.  In order to figure out what CPU is best, you need to figure out which chipset the mainboard has.   If it's an Intel 440FX, 440LX, or 440EX, the fastest CPU you can use is a 333MHz Pentium II If it's an Intel 440BX, Intel 440ZX, Via Apollo Pro or Pro+, the fastest CPU you can use is a 1GHz Pentium III If it's an Intel 820, Intel 820E, Via Apollo Pro 133, or Via Apollo Pro 133A, you've got two options for the fastest: the aforementioned 1GHz Pentium III, or a 1.4GHz Socket 370 Pentium III installed with the use of a slotket.   You can't use a modern CPU in an old computer.
I've taken a look at the website and here are my final two options:      Thermaltak 450w  Modular? No. (-) Cost? 159 zÅ‚. (+) Size/Length? 120mm. Warranty? 24 months. (+)  Corsair VS Series, 550w  Modular? No. (-) Cost? 215 zÅ‚. (+) Size/Length? 120mm. Warranty? 36 months. (++)   I would take the Corsair VS Series, as it has a better warranty and it has 100 more watts and is only 75 zÅ‚ higher in price. Since you want a durable & long-lasting PSU, this seems to be it.
Using eXtreme Outer Vision's eXtreme Power Supply calculator, the power consumption of your build comes to about 390 W. With some overclocking, this becomes 470 W. Any decent 500 - 550 W PSU should handle the load fine for several years with no problems, even if you do overclock a bit later.  I personally won't recommend the Corsair VS series, as it uses poor quality capacitors. Here are my recommendations from the site you posted.  Antec 550W VPF550 EC  The Antec VPF line is a relatively new series manufactured by Delta Electronics. It has Japanese capacitors and a 24 month warranty. Currently it is priced at 249 zÅ‚. Non modular, but that isn't much of a problem for lower capacity PSUs, it also has 80 + Bronze certification.  XFX Core TS 550W  The XFX TS series is a budget series manufactured by Seasonic (one of the best manufacturers of PSUs out there). It also has Japanese capacitors and a 60 month warranty (that's right, 5 years). It's one of my favorite recommendations: High quality at a relatively low price. Again, has 80+ Bronze certification and is non modular.  I took some time to shop around on some other Polish sites (which was a breeze as soon as I figured out what the word for Power Supply was), and I found the TS selling slightly cheaper at komputronik.pl. Overall, I think both PSUs will fit your needs, and it is up to you to choose the one you like better. Good luck.
The AMD R9 390 is slightly cheaper than the GTX 970 (Â£185), and offers similar or better performance in comparison to the Nvidia card you were showing. As a owner of this card myself, I am very pleased with it. Just keep in mind that if your Power Supply is not over 600 watts, you should choose an Nvidia GTX 970, as they use less power. Figuring the wattage of your PSU is easy, just take a look at the side of the unit.  A link to a relatively cheap R9 390 is here - this card has a slightly different cooler than the one I got for mine, but has the same overall design. It costs Â£185.  A link to a cheaper GTX 970 is here - again, this card is slightly less powerful but uses less power. After putting it in your cart, it should cost Â£192.
I would recommend the Logitech C920. It fits perfectly in your budget at $99.99. Here's the features it offers:   1080p Full HD Recording Dual Microphone H.264 compression Tripod mount Low light correction Autofocus Connection through USB
Your computer's RAM cannot be significantly upgraded.  Crucial's memory finder reports, and HP's support page agrees that your computer is limited to 4 GB of RAM.  Further, you appear to be running a 32-bit version of Windows, which for technical reasons is limited to about 3.25 GB of RAM.  If you really want to do this, I recommend figuring out which of the two sticks of memory in your computer is the 1 GB one, and replacing it with a Crucial 2 GB PC2-6400 stick for $27.  I don't have experience with this particular product, but I've had good luck with Crucial memory upgrades for older computers, and importantly, they guarantee compatibility.  If you upgrade, you'll also want to switch to a 64-bit operating system to get access to all your RAM.  Instructions on doing so are beyond the scope of this site, but you may be able to get useful information on SuperUser.
The Aten 4-Port USB Peripheral Sharing Device should work with your keyboard and mouse also i has a 9 usb port version. It has a lot of wires and its messy but should work with your setupThis doesn't have Hdmi so if your old KVM still works i would add that to the mix it has a wired button which is not the best but could do  also its recommende to stick it down to you pc.  Its small and not very expensive i think this should fit your needs/comes closest to fitting your needs. it sells for about 50 Dollars at amazone.com and added a link for you.  This is a usb 2.0 KVM so make sure your keyboard and mouse can run over that type.  Edit: I found the HDMI version of this product with 2 usb ports. the link you can find here.  Here are the instructions that should fix the problems with is. I hope this helps you.  I was looking for something to allow me to have less clutter on my desk for gaming. I wanted a single mouse and keyboard for both my pc and consoles when I game. I did not want to have to unplug and replug my mouse and keyboard when switching between the two. I did a week of research trying to find the perfect KVM switch for a price that I can justify (I really didn't want to spend $300+). One issue I read about was that with the cheaper ones, they were not compatible with gaming mice and keyboards, that if you use them you would lose functionality or they just won't work. With this KVM I was able to use my Corsair Vengeance K70 keyboard and M65 mouse just fine after some tweaking.  When I first plugged everything in, both mouse and keyboard did not work. What I had to do was plug my mouse and keyboard directly into my computer. Make sure the KVM was completely unplugged. While holding the port selector button I plugged in one of the purple USB plugs into my computer to enter firmware update mode (this is indicated by both port LEDs on the KVM blinking in unison). Visit the Aten's website and specifically look up the CS692 and download the latest firmware update. Run the program and update the KVM (if it fails make sure the kvm is still in update mode, if not reenter it). Now unplug the KVM and your mouse and keyboard from the computer. Plug the mouse and keyboard into the KVM and a set of the USB cords coming from the KVM into the computer. Make sure the KVM was selected to the correct port. I had to put my keyboard into BIOS mode. Press [Scroll Lock]>[Scroll Lock]>[m]>[Enter] to get the mouse to register. Press [Scroll Lock]>[Scroll Lock]>[n]>[Enter] to get the keyboard to work in non-bios mode. After that everything has been working great and I really enjoy the ease of my new setup.  Now for anyone who wants to use this with the XIM4, it gets kinda finicky. Make sure the black USB is plugged into Port 1, and the purple into Port 2. Have the KVM switched to the XIM4 prior to turning on the console, or switch it over and unplug and replug the XIMs USB to the console to reset it or your mouse will never mount to the XIM. Also with this specific keyboard I had to use it in BIOS mode because the XIM doesn't fully support it, not anything to do with the KVM.  I'm not sure how compatible this KVM will be with future gaming mice and keyboards but when I was looking at Aten's site, it appears they are releasing firmware updates once a year to ensure compatibility with newer devices. I will update this review if my KVM starts to malfunction or if I discover something wrong with it.  So far this was a great purchase and I couldn't be happier. Did exactly what I wanted. I would highly recommend this KVM for those who need compatibility with gaming peripherals.  Please note that I only tested the keyboard and mouse functionality. I didn't bother with the audio, or HDMI because I did not need it for what I was doing.
There are a couple Cooler Master, Corsair (AX and RM) and EVGA series power supplies that disable their fan under low load.  My recommendation: EVGA SuperNova 550 G2 (220-G2-0550-Y1)   Within budget ($80 at newegg) EVGA Eco Mode: Fan does not switch on until PSU load is above 25% 550 Watts, which is just above your calculated optimal. 80 plus Gold for efficiency. Made by Super Flower, which almost always guarentees a high quality PSU.
The Kobo Aura H2o is what you need. its a pater proof e-reader with e-ink display and can survive 30 min in 1 meter deep water. It also has a hd display and supports almost all formats under the sun. I believe it's about 180 dollars. There is a case accessory that snaps off by the looks of it. This cover makes it so you don't stab the unit it self but the case. It has an online books store and can be loaded up with microUSB according to their site. You might need to run whine with it.  Good luck with the search I hope this helps you.  Link to product  Overall it's a high res e-paper display tables e-reader with some cool features and is not very expensive.
A friend bought an Asus VX239W for a similar use case, and after seeing it a couple of times, I'm considering it too. Great image quality and overall screen for the price.  But buy it in Spain for example, much better price considering the exchange rate.
MX Blue switches are known to have the most tactile feedback and loudest click of Cherry's MX range. If you are using it for gaming (which from the razer I am guessing you are), you want to be looking at the MX Cherry Red Keyboards. These have light feedback and a quieter click, allowing for a much smoother game. There is a good answer explaning on here.  You cannot find many Cherry MX Blue RGB keyboards as RGB keyboards these are generally designed for gamers and gamers tend to use MX Red. There was the Corsair K70 and K95 RGB MX Cherry blue keyboards, however these are available on the corsair website but seem to have been discontinued in many stores.  I would suggest the equivalent Corsair K70 RGB Mechanical Keyboard. It has Cherry MX Red switches for smooth gaming and fully programmable RGB backlighting, it also has alot of effects on the lighting and solid software to do this. It is also the latest 2016 edition just released so no worries of a newer version arriving soon.
Josh Spoors does a great explanation on the different switches, so I'm not going to do it again. But what I am going to do is to recommend you a product. Since the K70 RGB with Blue Switch is discontinued, there is another great product. Let me introduce you to the GSkill KM780 RGB with the Cherry MX Blue switch. GSkill is new to the keyboard market but is a very good player in the RAM industry. Their first attempt at a keyboard is great. It is solidly built, comes with genuine Cherry MX Switches, and has almost all the features a K70 has.
I did some testing with a Radeon 5770.  In my judgment, it's massive overkill for your uses, but since you're worried about performance, overkill is good.  You don't mention what you're doing with WebGL, so I tested it by activating compositing and then running a few pages from a Google search for "WebGL benchmark".  Everything performed smoothly.  Now, the 5770 is an old card (you can probably find one used for $50 or less).  Newer cards from AMD that should offer similar performance are the R7 250 and R7 360 cards, both of which are reportedly well-supported by the open-source drivers.  Newegg offers an R7 250 for $70 and an R7 360 for $99, so you should be able to find something suitable at the European retailer of your choice.
I recommend the XFX TS 550W 80+ Gold (P1-550G-TS3X), which currently sells for Â£55 at CCL online. It is a non modular unit manufactured by Seasonic and rated 80+ Gold. Crucially, there are 2 6+2 pin PCIe connectors and another 2 6 pin connectors, for a total of 4 PCIe connectors; therefore it will not only support your current 970, it will also be capable of handling (subject to capacity limitations) another GTX 970 in SLI, should you choose to upgrade. It also has a 5 year warranty.
You might want to look into the Nikon 1 J5 camera. It is a DSLR grade pocket camera with interchangeable lens. MSRP of this camera is USD$499.99 so it should cost less in stores. Features:   Interchangeable lens using the Nikon 1 mount MASP (Manual, Aperture, Shutter, Programmed Auto) modes 20.8 Megapixels 13.2mm x 8.8mm sensor size WiFi & NFC 3.9in x 2.4in x 1.3in size
The Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro will be perfect for you. It only costs $699.99. Features it has:   3200 x 1800 display 13.3 inch screen Intel Core M CPU 256/512GB SSD Good battery life Backlit keyboard 8GB of RAM   Another device that fits your price range is the HP Spectre x360. This is slightly more at $799.99 ($100 more than the Yoga 3 Pro). This is the major differences between this and the Yoga 3 Pro:   Lower resolution screen (1080p) Better CPU (5th Gen Core i5)
I recommend the Antec High Current Gamer HCG-750M, a 750W, semi modular, 80+ Bronze PSU made by Seasonic. This will support any single GPU system and most dual GPU systems, with some light overclocking (up to GTX 980 or R9 380), though two of the higher end AMD GPUs will require additional capacity. The power supply is the same platform as the M2II Evo, a very high quality PSU.  80+ certification measures the efficiency of the PSU. Silver and Gold PSUs are a few percent more efficent that Bronze PSUs, which are at least 82-85% efficent, depending on load.
I would go with GTX 970 (4GB DDR5 version), which is just around 325$. This is the top 10 best currently commercially available graphics card and will last you for years. The processor should not be a bottleneck, at least for now. Though I would consider, unless you have one, adding a custom CPU cooling, and adding a front/top  fan to have at least 3 - see for reference on how many is enough here: how many fans should I have?.
The clock speed of RAM doesn't affect the performance of the computer much (if at all). Running a RAM at a faster speed would increase the CAS latency, which is the amount of clock cycle lag the RAM has (lower is better). But the advantage would be a faster transfer speed. Decreasing the speed means a lower CAS latency but a slower transfer speed. For normal purposes, the different clock speeds would not have much of a difference. But if you plan on running super high performance RAMDisk (or similar applications) a faster RAM would benefit you significantly. When I choose RAM, I buy the cheapest RAM that is from a trusted brand and is aesthetically pleasing (has a nice looking heat spreader).  To choose between the Kingston Fury and the Savage, it would depend on what you want to do with the RAM. If you have a higher budget and want more overclock, go with the Savage. If you have a lower budget and/or will not overclock your RAM, go with the Fury. They really don't have a huge difference.  You really shouldn't have a upgrading "scheme". I would usually leave 2 or more slots empty (unless I'm maxing out my RAM right when I build my computer) so I can upgrade it later. I only upgrade it when I need it (e.g. the stuff I do requires more RAM) and not in a "schedule" and you should do this too.
I would say you would be better off building a new computer. Here are the reasons:   Your CPU is probably only good for one more upgrade then it can't go any further. With a new build, you could choose a socket that you could upgrade possibly 2 or 3 more times, depending on how often and what performance you desired As you mentioned, your computer uses DDR2 RAM. DDR3 and DDR4 RAM are much faster and will be avaliable for future upgrades. A 650W power supply should be sufficient for awhile whether you upgrade or build a newer machine, provided it is of good quality Your current build only has a PCIe 1.1 or 2.0 slot. From what I have read (I'm not 100% on this), a PCIe 3.0 card will work in a PCIe 2.0 slot without being slower except for very high end configurations such as the highest end cards or multi-card configurations such as SLI or Crossfire. Still, upgrading would provide you the option of upgrading the graphics several times.   As someone else pointed out, the only parts worth saving are the power supply, optical drive, and hard drive. The case would depend on how easy it would be to put new parts in the case.  My recommendation then would be to build a budget system, picking out the processor/chipset you want to keep and making sure the motherboard is something that will be good for awhile, as that is the component that is the biggest pain to upgrade. However, if you thought just upgrading the graphics card would get you by for awhile, then you could buy that as most cards will probably work in the system. Then you could take the card into a new build down the road when you thought you were ready. Keep in mind that you are more likely to bottleneck somewhere else in this instance, with a modern GPU but much older CPU and RAM.  EDIT: In response to the question update:  Motherboard and processor: You first need to decide on which socket you want to use. There are a couple viable options: LGA 1150, LGA 1151, and LGA 2011. Of these, LGA 2011 is older, but has seen a recent update (LGA 2011-v3, which is not compatible with the older LGA 2011 socket); LGA 1150 is the least advanced but the most available; and LGA 1151 is the newest, but also more expensive. The good news is that virtually any modern Core i5 or i7, and a good amount of Core i3s, that fit these sockets would be faster than a Q6600. As far as future upgrades:   LGA 1150 will probably see the fewest future upgrades, both to chipsets and faster processors. It uses DDR3 memory exclusively, and also has the fewest USB 3.0 and 3.1 compatible motherboards. However, most motherboards range from $50-200, with a significant portion under $150, and has the most motherboards to choose from (211 on newegg.com, for example).    Processors that fit this socket as good as a i7-4790: i7-4790K, i7-5775C, i7-4770K. Note: some high-end i5s, such as the i5-4690K, when overclocked can beat a stock i7-4790 in performance or be so close as to be indistinguishable  LGA 2011 is a more narrow spectrum of processors, and more high end. Advantages include DDR4 memory, dual full-speed PCIe 3.0x16 lanes on some models, and 6-core processors with large caches. However, many of these advantages are more noticeable in rendering applications rather than gaming, or only in very specific cases. Additionally, most of these processors carry high price tags, and there aren't really entry level processors in this group (the cheapest retails for over $300)   Processors that meet your requirements: i7-5960X, 5930K, and 5820K.  LGA 1151 provides probably the most future upgrades, provides DDR4 memory support, a fairly large selection of motherboards, and much more ubiquitous support for features like USB 3.1. Downsides are that the motherboards are predominately slightly more expensive (more between $150-200), but they do offer more entry-level processors, such as i3 and i5 processors for between $120-220.   Processors that meet your requirements: i7-6700K, i7-6700 (limited selection of processors currently, more likely to come).    Graphics: According to this GPU hierarchy, The lowest end card that is an upgrade that is nVIDIA is either a GTX 660 Ti or a GTX 760, but neither are readily available (old). The best value in a low end nVIDIA card is a GTX 950, which will run you about $135-150. An integrated Intel card could provide you with more performance, but it wouldn't be much of an increase over your current card and even the cheapest dedicated GPUs avaliable now would outclass it.  Conclusion  You have two routes that I see as viable both now and longer-term: save a little money now and go with LGA 1150, or go with LGA 1151 and have a longer viable lifespan. Keep in mind that you can still build a really really good machine on LGA 1150 that will still produce impressive gaming results for years, but if you will want the possibility to stay with the latest and greatest, LGA 1151 is probably a safer bet.  Specifics   Virtually any modern motherboard supports at least 8GB of RAM - indeed, I don't know of any that use either of the chipsets that support less than 16. Basically all of them at least have a single PCIe x16 slot, which is sufficient for basically any graphics card, provided there is physical room in the case and on the board. Also, 6 SATA ports and 6 USB ports (counting connections for a front case header) are virtually standard, as is a 100MBps Ethernet connection. As far as SD slots go, virtually any will support them (usually through a SATA connection), but you'll have to be such a reader separately. With that said, I've picked a board that meets your requirements:   Gigabyte GA-Z170XP-SLI ($129.99). It supports:    LGA 1151 (Core i7-6700K) 64GB Dual Channel DDR4 RAM (4 slots). Can be overclocked up to 3466 MHz. Three PCIe x16 slots (supports 3-way Crossfire and 2-way SLI) 6 SATA 6Gb/s connectors, 3 SATA Express 6x USB ports on the back (mix of 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1). also includes 4 USB headers for the front and a USB Type-C port on the back. 10/100/1000Mbps Ethernet Front panel audio header (headphone/mic)   Keep in mind I don't have specific experience with any LGA 1151 board - I picked this one because it was fairly well reviewed and met all your requirements at a decent price.
The GTX 950 is definitely a better performance-per-dollar card than the GTX 960. The 950 costs slightly more than half the the 960 but delivers much more than half of a 960. But this doesn't mean you shouldn't buy the 960. Since you wanted to game at 1080p at 60 fps, the 950 would not be able to do that consistently on a slightly demanding title, but the 960 would be able to do that.   If you only want to play casual games at low to medium settings and want to save money, the 950 is what you should get. But if you want to play some more demanding titles and higher settings with a higher budget, go for the 960.
You will not be able to use that set of RAM since the CPU doesn't support. Even though the motherboard supports 128GB of RAM, the CPU unfortunately only supports up to 64GB of RAM. The only way to max out your RAM right now is to get 8 x 8GB sticks. To support the full 128GB of RAM, you would need a Xeon CPU that works in the LGA 2011 socket.
I would suggest the Monster DNAs for about Â£100 so around 130 euros, these headphones are a comfortable set of on-ear headphones, with a tangle free detatchable cable. They are made of plastic, however they are extremely sturdy and will bend to almost straight without being damaged. The pieces are designed to pop out before snapping allowing easy reassembly.  They also look pretty cool, available in a range of colours and come in a nice box with travel bag. Another cool feature of these is the Music sharing feature, the headphones have 2 3.5mm jacks in series, so if you have music playing through your headphones, someone else can plug their headphones into yours and you can both listen to the same track.  Another suggestion are the Audio-Technica-ATH-M50X over ear headphones. I have a friend that ahd a pair of these and he said they were amazing for the price (Â£88 on amazon currently). They have thick cushioned ear pads so comfortable, 3 removable cables (1.5m/3.0m/1.5-3.0m coiled). Cnet have a good detailed revie wont hese and they are also the best seller son amazon currently in the UK.
I was using the "HP Pavillion DM1 4000-SG" for a while now until I got a Desktop PC and...   I was able to play Minecraft with around 50 FPS (Optifine installed) programm in Java using eclipse It has a 13,1 inch-display (I think) and is just as large as a normal DIN A4-Paper   I discovered just two downsides regarding the Laptop:   the CPU-Cooler has a high rotation speed resulting in the keyboard not responding after around 12 hours of non-stop usage the Pavillion-Series from HP goes for good Hardware but after around one year of usage, you may need to adjust some screws below the display, the rest is fine   The only downside regarding your requirements is, that it comes with Windows Pre-Installed and a standard HDD.
Pre-rooted phones are a niche market. As a practical matter, I think you should settle for one that is easy to root.  One of the few phones to come rooted was Fairphone 1, but it isn't manufactured anymore and doesn't have Android updates after Lollipop. Fairphone 2 comes with a non-rooted OS by default, and has an official rooted OS image, but the official rooted image is not being updated. However, it is supported by LineageOS.  Fairphone is a fair trade phone: they strive to ensure that the whole manufacturing chain from mining to assembling respects decent labor standards (working conditions, pay, etc.). It's markedly more expensive (and also heavier at 168g) than other phones with similar performance. Buying a Fairphone is a social gesture, not a purely consumerist purchase. Fairphone documents the cost breakdown (first edition). On the upside, if some part breaks, you can order a spare: you won't get stuck with a battery molded in plastic!  Fairphone's attitude towards openness is somewhat ambiguous. They prioritize fair trade over software openness, so some components use proprietary drivers. However, they are sufficiently committed to openness to ensure that you will always get an unlocked bootloader.  I have a Fairphone 2 and I'm happy with it now. However, until someone managed to make a LineageOS build, the choice was between an obsolete rooted OS from Fairphone and the official non-rooted, up-to-date OS.  If the important thing is to have a phone that you're sure you can root, I feel the best advice is to get a Google flagship phone. These are designed to be development phones and so come with an unlocked bootloader, they have official OS updates longer than just about any other phone, and they tend to have good community support (through CyanogenMod and now LineageOS).
I found that in general most 960 cards from various brands all run at similar noise levels. The EVGA 960 (4gb) runs fairly quiet when under 60 degrees celsius, but will start to be noticeable if not similar to other cards when above that temperature.   When it comes to cards being maxed out in usage, the MSI 960(2gb) seems to be quieter than several other brands, based off of various videos I found comparing noise levels.
I've used a compact IOGEAR keyboard on an HTPC before. I was impressed with how comfortable it felt to hold.  Product: IOGEAR Multimedia Keyboard (Model: GKM561R)    This keyboard has the following features:   Rubber grips on the sides  Separate scroll wheel and track ball Mouse sensitivity adjustments Compact   It does not have a charger though. It utilizes two AA batteries.
After seeing @Alpha3031's comment, I checked the Gigabyte site.  v3.1 of the board is AM3+, v1.3 is AM3 with this additional note:      If you install AMD AM3 CPU on this motherboard, the system bus speed   will downgrade from HT3.0 (5200MT/s) to HT1.0 (2000 MT/s) spec.   Gigabyte's product pages for the two versions:   GA-M68MT-S2 (rev. 1.3) GA-M68MT-S2 (rev. 3.1)   I tried plugging the model number into pcpartpicker.com and got some interesting results...   http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-motherboard-gam68mts2 http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-motherboard-gam68mts2p   The listing for both - up to a 980 GPU and up to an 8-core, 3.1ghz CPU (AMD FX-8120) .  It seems both will accept your hexacore as well.    Considering the average game still hasnt figured out how to use 4 cores, I'd stick to the hexacore, and just find the baddest GPU/16+GB RAM/250+GB SSD you can afford.  As far as bottleneck, with the AM3 version, that will definitely be your bottleneck, AM3+ maybe not as much?
Considering your games are not the most demanding, I'd recommend using a slight bit extra money to get a 256GB SSD. Even if you don't need that extra space, it'll be faster and more write-durable, due to the extra chips. Your PSU isn't exactly high quality, so I'd hesitate to recommend AMD's high end. Tonga would be fine on your computer though.  For those reasons, I recommend the Tonga PRO R9 380, specifically, the Sapphire R9 380 Dual X 2GB retailing at Â£142.22 at Amazon.uk. Yeah, it's a lot less than your budget, but it's going to be all you need to do what you want.  If you feel the need to have more VRAM (for big textures, maybe) or want to have an easy upgrade, I'd recommend any 4 GB version of the same card. Unfortunately, SLI is not possible, and using PCIe X4 would likely be very bad in terms of performance, even with AMD Crossfire, therefore, multi card configs are not recommended. You'd have to purchase a new single GPU, upgrade your Motherboard and/or upgrade your PSU.  The equivalent from Nvidia is the GTX 960, with both 2 GB and 4 GB versions as well. The advantages are that it may be slightly faster in certain games, it runs slightly cooler and may be a better overclocker. The difference is really small though. It may be slower in other games, and you'll have to wipe the AMD drivers beforehand. The two cards both have their merits, and it's really just brand preference if the prices are similar.
I would  upgrade the memory to at least 8GB.   An SSD would be a good idea to put the OS on, as well as a few programs/games that you want to start up fast.  Another thing that will help a lot when gaming on high quality is graphics memory. If the game textures are big, they can't fit on graphics memory, and are stored in normal memory instead. That makes things a lot slower.  You should probably get a reasonably new graphics card with at least 4GB of memory on it. Something like an r9 390, or 380 if you don't have the money.  As for the PSU, apparently, it's fine.  As for the processor, it's probably fine.
I would get a chromebook. Most of them are cheap, and they all have a local disk. There might not be a very big disk, especially if it's an SSD, but that shouldn't be a problem, considering your applications.  The reason I recommend a chromebook is that ChromeOS is basically Linux with a different UI.   Just like any other computer, you can boot INSERT FAVOURITE DISTRO HERE from a usb, and install it on the disk.  If you want to have GNU+Linux installed by default, you could try something like this.
I would go with Z170A gaming pro, because it's futureproof: supports DDR up to 3400 MHz, has good heat sinks and has everything you need & more, and fits well under your budget. The cheaper alternative for me would be H170 (still great).
There are very few memory bound tasks for modern CPUs. The key factors to look for are capacity, cost, latency, voltages and speed, usually in that order. It doesn't really matter if a CPU doesn't support a RAM speed. You just need motherboard support and go into BIOS to activate the XMP setting, so that it'll run at the rated speed rather than the SPD speed.  Without any further details about your specific workload (which is very important), my general recommendation, besides not to get a Z170 board unless you really need the extra IO, Smart Sound, or want to get a K CPU (overclocking), is to get 16 GB RAM straight away. It is very easy to use up 8 GB of RAM if you do more than one thing at a time, or if you're using anything that uses a lot of RAM. The price of DDR4 has dropped as well, so it is reasonably affordable to get 2 x 8 GB kits, in fact, cheaper than 2 x 4 GB kits of DDR3 last year: The G.Skill Ripjaws 4 series has a 2400 MT/s 15-15-15-35 kit for $74.99 at newegg.com. G.Skill is one of the largest manufacturers of RAM, and has a reputation for good quality. Their Sniper series generally has slightly more headroom, but it's just going to shave a few seconds off a 10 minute compression or video rendering, to name some memory bound tasks.  Basically, "overclocking friendly" just means that the factory clocks are slightly less aggressive, and that you can increase them a bit more while still being stable. The PC* ***** naming is just a different way of naming DDR* ****. The number directly after the PC and DDRs is the version number, and the second number is the bandwidth in MB/s for the PC scheme, and the clock rate in MT/s (twice the real clock rate) for the DDR scheme. Since DDR RAM has a 64 bit wide bus and there are 8 bits in a byte, the PC number is just 8 times the DDR number.  It doesn't really matter how you upgrade, just keep in mind that using memory from different kits may be unstable. The chance is low if they are the same model, but it's still there. Since you only have 4 RAM slots though, I'd just get a 2 x 8 GB kit and another when you decide it's not enough. Good luck.    Addendum: On memory timings  Memory timings tell the CPU how long to wait before expecting an action to be completed on the memory chip, and in SDRAM (clocked + refreshed RAM), is measured in RAM clock cycles (which is half the DDR number). Memory is arranged in rows, which are divided in to columns.  CAS Latency determines the amount of time the CPU to wait after issuing a read command before actually reading the data from the output pin. If this is shorter than the time it takes for the RAM to respond fully, what is read is a voltage that is transitioning between the previous voltage on the output pin and the desired one. This is bad and sometimes causes the computer to crash.  But CAS Latency is the full latency only if the right row is already open! If there is no row open, the CPU has to issue an Activation command first, and wait. This is the next number, tRCD, the RAS to CAS delay.  The third number is tRP. The Row Precharge time is the time you need to wait between a Precharge command and an Activate command; the time it takes to close a row, if you have the wrong one open.  Finally, the last number is basically CAS + tRCD, and then a bit more. It's the minimum amount of time a row can be active. There's a bit more again to let the memory finish passing on the voltage.
Looking over the specs of the 5820K versus the 6700K, notable differences are:   Larger cache (15MB vs 8MB) More cores and threads Higher memory bandwidth   All of these would probably be of benefit when working, however it has a lower clock speed. That might be the dealbreaker here, as while having lots of threads is great for multitasking (and possibly compiling, not sure if that applies to JDK? Some compilers are still single-threaded) clock speed is also important.   If you intend to overclock the 5820K (quick google search reveals people have got it over 4.0GHz and stable, but runs pretty hot) then I'd say it's safe to go for the 5820K. But if you don't want to do that, the 6700K might be a better choice given that it is already faster, can be overclocked higher, runs cooler while drawing less power.  So, if you'll benefit more from multithreading take the 5820K  Or, if you need the raw single-core speed take the 6700K  A good comparison of the two from LinusTechTips
The i7 5820K would be much faster than the i7 6700K. None of the programs you will use will benefit from an i7 5820K or even an i7 6700K for that matter. An i5 6600K will be enough for what you are doing. The 5820K will only benefit from much larger multithreaded workloads (such as virtualization or video rendering) and where more PCIe lanes are needed (allows up to 24 PCIe lanes). Your GPU will also bottleneck your system if you perform any slightly GPU-intensive tasks (such as gaming or video editing).
So after the extended research I found the following evidence:  10 minutes of constant load test by Toms Hardware :   Asus Strix GeForce GTX 960: 35 dB EVGA GeForce GTX 960 SSC: 35 dB ZOTAC AMP! GeForce GTX 960: 36.5 dB MSI Gaming 2G GeForce GTX 960: 34 dB     And the rest of makes in yet another Toms Hardware test:   Asus GTX 960 StriX OC: 35.8 dB Gainward GTX 960 Phantom OC: 35.9 dB Galax/KFA GTX 960 EX OC: 36.2 dB Gigabyte GTX 960 WindForce OC: 35.8 dB Gigabyte GTX 960 Gaming G1: 34.6 dB inno3D GTX 960 iChill: 36.4 dB Palit GTX 960 Super JetStream: 36.6 dB   From the above I conclude, that the quietest card is MSI Gaming 2G GeForce GTX 960 and Gigabyte GTX 960 Gaming G1, because it's hard to compre between tests.
After some more research, I hardly founds anything. The hard part with this search is the RAM - most that meet your specs are workstations or gaming laptops, both of which tend to be large. That said, I did find ONE laptop that seems to meet your requirements: (Disclaimer: I have not used any of the products or laptops mentioned here)    MSI GS40   It is small: 14.0" screen, 13.58" W x 9.65" D x 0.87" H, and at 3.75 lbs (1701 grams) it is well lighter than your requirement. Linux support: there's not a lot out there on this, presumably because it's a high-end gaming laptop and gamers tend to use Windows, but it appears just about everything should work with some configuration, according to this page. Note that those results are based off of Debian, so YMMV if you are using another distro. I suspect Ubuntu would probably work fine as well, but I can't find any confirmation. It supports 32GBs of RAM (2x16GB DDR4 DIMMS @2133MHz) Its display outputs are limited (1 mini DisplayPort, 1 HDMI), however it is possible AFAIK to use a DisplayPort hub such as this one and then use DisplayPort to DVI cables, or use a Matrox TripleHead2Go adapter. The only processor avaliable that I saw was the Intel Skylake i7-6700HQ (2.6GHz) processor, which is significantly faster The display is a 14.0â€ FHD 16:9 LED Backlit Wide screen (1920x1080) Anti-Glare Matte Type Screen It does not appear to be compatible with a Dell E-Port Replicator; all of Dell's models that had 32GB of RAM had at least 15" screens. Cost is approximately $1800 for the base 32GB model, which comes with the aforementioned processor, RAM,  and screen, 3GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970M, 128GB M.2 NVMe PCIe SSD, 1TB 7200RPM SATA III 2.5" HDD, and Bigfoot Networks Killer Dual Band Wireless-AC N1525 - 802.11 AC/A/B/G/N Wireless LAN Module + Bluetooth 4.1. Upgrades to storage and some other components can be done. Note that there are probably other places to buy this, but it is not available directly from MSI and most retail versions ship with 16GB of RAM   There is another option, but it does have a larger screen:    Dell Precision 15 5000  Dell's new Precision 15 5000 series is the smallest 15" I have found (it weighs under 4lbs, but still has a 15" screen) that supports 32GBs of RAM. Due to its InfinityEdge display, its dimensions are barely larger than the MSI above (and smaller in some ways), at 14.06" x 9.27" x 0.66". Dell states it supports 32GB of RAM, but currently only sells it with 16, presumably because it is a recent release (Q4 2015).  As far as connectors, it comes with 1 Thunderbolt and 1 HDMI, so again, adapters would be required. As far as Linux, again I can't find confirmation of it on Dell's site but Tom's says it is supported, and Dell has supported Linux offerings in the past. And as far as the port replicator, I don't know, but it is a business-class Dell (although it is a thin-and-light version), so I'm not sure. Starting price is $1399, so you'll probably pay $1800-2000 for one with 32GB of RAM.
I've had good success with the following card on Mac:  Diamond VC500  It has Linux support as well according to the link, but I have not tested it. Here are the specifications:   USB 2.0 Supports NTSC and PAL Captures Composite RCA or S-Video input 640 x 480 @30FPS NTSC video capture 720 x 576 @25FPS PAL video capture Included Software: Videoglide for Mac OS, EZGrabber for Windows   References   VC500 MAC FAQs VC500 Quick Installation Guide EZGrabber Video Capture Driver VideoGlide for Mac OSX
I would recommend the LG 34UM95C. It is a great 34" WQHD 21:9 monitor that would be great for both movies and game. It is good for movies since it is a 21:9 ratio so the top black bars in movies are gone. Combined with the excellent color reproduction of the IPS display, it makes movies very enjoyable. The 5ms response time is also great for gaming for minimal lag. The UltraWide also makes the game more immersive.
The Magic Mouse is totally perfect for Blender 3D.  My argument though comes with a caveat, you need to install the Better Touch Tool (BTT) and add more gestures. (See picture attached).   Now you have middle click (By using 3 finger Click) and all the rest.    I did buy the M557 as well but I sold it after awhile since I just love the magic mouse so much (Apparently with the help of BTT).
The HP ENVY 32 is what I'd recommend for gaming and movies    This is a slight step up from 1080p which has a resolution of 2560 x 1440 (60 hertz) but without the strain of 4K on price and your computer. It has a fast 7ms response time which shouldn't cause any lag in games. It comes with a remote control which also makes it great for watching movies along with a bright 300 nits display. Reviews also praise this monitor for providing a great movie and gaming experience.
Depending on your needs I've added a few various cameras. All are great choices and meet the specifications the question provided, but it's up to you to decide which one you think fits your needs best.    Sony Action Cam - $115 - $198  I'd recommend Sony's Action Cam line up.    Sony's Action Cam offers a wide variety of features, a quality build, and all at a reasonable price.  Sony offers a wide variety of their Action Cams, but I'll be recommending the AS2000V. The Sony "Action Cam"s can take 1080p @60fps and great 8.8MP photos. It supports 240fps slow-mo, and a great microphone. It supports 60m waterproof. It also has video stabilization with SteadyShot which I've heard great things about.  Alternatives  I highly recommend you take a look at the wide variety of Action Cams, these don't get too expensive and offer many features. An example is the Sony AS15 which is only $128 on Amazon and offers a similar set of features. Also, be on the lookout for discounts as these frequently go on sale.     This camera has a lot to offer with it's wide variety of features making it a great choice if you'll be doing some shaky video, low-light filming, or for general use.   GoPro, $129 - $199  The popular GoPro is a popular choice for a sports and action camera. While price ranges, GoPros have a wide range of accessories and mounts to choose from.  The GoPro I'd recommend is the GoPro Hero ~$129. If you want, a WiFi equipped model which also offers slightly better specs, it's starts at $199    The GoPro Hero can take 1080p @30fps (60 WiFi model) video, photos can be taken at 5MP (8MP WiFi model), and supports up to a 32GB MicroSD. It's also waterproof up to 40 meters.  Alternatives  I've already talked about the HERO with WiFi but the HERO4 Session also the same specs as the HERO with WiFi at the same price. The HERO4 though has a much simpler design, which can work great for hobby use but may lack functionality for power-users.     I'd recommend the GoPro if you'll take advantage of it's wide-array of mounts and accessories   ISAW, $100 - $189  The ISAW EDGE ~$189 seems to be a perfect fit.    The ISAW EDGE can take 1080p @60fps, and even 4K. It can take up to a 64GB Micro SD card and can take 16MP stills. It features underwater capabilities up to 40m.  Alternatives  The ISAW Air runs at 1080p @30fps, takes 12MP photos but requires a case for waterproof (~$25)  The ISAW WING runs at 1080p @30fps, takes 12MP photos and features a 40m waterproof housing.     The ISAW offers well balanced specs at a reasonable price, it has a relatively easy-to-use graphical interface.
The RAM is probably the main change I would make to your proposed specs.  Narrowing Down the Options  If you're going to want an iMac, especially for video editing, you're going to need a fast hard-disk, enough RAM, and definitely a good GPU. This immediately narrows down the selection to a 27-in 5K iMac. Why? The 5K iMacs are the only ones offering discrete graphics. The 21" iMac offers only a 5400RPM hard disk which is much too slow for video-editing.  The Optimal Specs  I'm going to assume you're editing 1080p video. 1080p video directly out of a camera can is around 300MP, for 10 minutes. OS X tend to use around ~4GB for the system, running Final Cut, live streaming video, and handling audio, 8GB might run out quickly. At the least 16GB what I'd say is the minimum RAM for your case. 32GB would be best.  What I'd Recommend  I'm going to recommend the 27" 5K iMac with:   3.2GHz quad-core i5 (base CPU) 16GB RAM 1TB Fusion Drive AMD Radeon R9 M380 with 2GB video memory (base GPU)   With 16GB of RAM, this comes out to $1,969.00, and with 32GB $2,329.00  Alternative RAM Option  If you're comfortable with manually upgrading the RAM (yes, 27" 5K iMac has user-upgradable RAM). You can purchase an 8GB model and use a OWC RAM upgrade kit (only $129-$249).  This brings your total price for a 16GB to $1,918 and for 32GB to $2,038
Chromebook would be ideal for this. I have the asus c300 chromebook and installed linux on it, works perfectly. You can see a review of chromebooks here: http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-chromebooks-top-5-chromebooks-in-the-us-1233696  It's silent, has long battery life and is cheap.

While this may not be the best solution depending on your case airflow, the Arctic Accelero S3 may interest you. Passive cooling is more common on server components, but the Accelero S3 is a GPU heatsink that can support 135W TDP, or 200W with its "Turbo Module" (but it's just a fan, which rather defeats the purpose of the heatsink). While the Twin Frozr V is very quiet, it can't really beat not having fans at all. With good case airflow, the  temperature is significantly higher, but not worryingly so.  Why you may not want this:   It costs $55 dollars, which, while still being under budget if you pick one of the cheaper 960s to mod, this is a pretty hefty investment. Other fans have to work harder, so the gains may not be obvious This will probably void your warranty It doesn't eliminate coil whine   So, why would you want this?  If you're serious about wanting a silent PC, and have already chosen a soundproofed case, quiet fans and a good CPU cooler, this is a good option. Otherwise, don't bother, there are easier and cheaper ways of quieting your PC.
The yoga tab 3's 480p screen would be a pain to watch on. A 480p screen at 10" size is already terrible (80 ppi). The 480p screen would be ok for stuff like video conferencing or a presentation but would be very terrible for movies. The ZTE SPro 2 has a much better quality projector (720p). This will have the same pixel density as the yoga tab 3 when at 20" (78 ppi). These projectors are pretty dim so you will need a darker environment.
The 840 EVO and 850 EVO are both consumer TLC SSDs by Samsung. The EVO series doesn't exactly have any differentiation, and the 850 EVO is not the higher end model, rather, it is the newer generation. The reason that the 840 EVO has risen in price is most likely because it's an retired series and therefore no longer manufactured in volume.  The chief differences between the two SSDs are in the NAND and controller. The inclusion of 3D V-NAND improves performance and write endurance, while the downgrade of the controller to two cores would decrease it. The overall effect in the wild would appear to be a moderate increase in write and mixed IO speed, with a more minor increase in read speed and a minor decrease in deep queue read speed. Overall, read and random mixed IO would probably play the major role in normal desktop operation, You should get no advantages with the older 840 EVO.

Yes, OWC does in fact make such Blu-ray drives for Macs.  If you just want read (not write) support for Blu-ray disks, thereâ€™s the OWC Slim 6X Portable USB 2.0 Blu-ray Reader.  If you want both read and write support for Blu-ray disks, thereâ€™s the OWC Slim 6X Portable USB 2.0 Blu-ray Burner.  Keep in mind they use a USB 'Y'-type cable, so youâ€™ll need two available USB ports if you want to power the drives without a separate power adapter.    EDIT: After checking around a bit, it seems like while the above drives include a USB 'Y'-type cable, it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean they actually require a USB 'Y'-type cable:     â€œmost give you the option for 2 incase you have a low power USB port,   with newer macs you probably don't need to use the second port.      i've got an older asus external, and it works fine on one port on my   retina mpbâ€   and     â€œI chatted with OWC about this   one tonight and they   said that it should work fine on one plug in most situations.   Unfortunately, they also confirmed my fear that if it did need the   second plug for some reason, you'd be SOL because the Y-split only   provides a short length of chord for each plug.â€   Of course, as you noted, the issue of the Y-cableâ€™s length can be solved with an extension cable. The only remaining issue (well, not including your USB 3 requirement) would be if the USB ports on your Retina MacBook Pro provide enough power so that youâ€™d only need one of them. According to this page, the OWCMRSSBD6X-series (the two Slim drives I mentioned above) have a power draw of 6.3 W.  Apple has an extremely useful and detailed page here detailing how much power is provided by a Macâ€™s USB ports:     Apple computers and displays with USB 1.1 or USB 2 ports provide:         Up to 500 mA (Milliamps) at 5 V (Volts) (thatâ€™s 2.5 W of power per port (5 V Ã— 0.5 A = 2.5 W)) to most Apple USB peripherals and all   USB peripherals not made by Apple in compliance with USB   specifications.         Apple computers with USB 3 ports (using USB 3   cables) provide:         Up to 900 mA (milliamps) at 5 V (Volts) (thatâ€™s 4.5 W of power per port (5 V Ã— 0.9 A = 4.5 W)) to most Apple USB peripherals and all   USB peripherals not made by Apple in compliance with USB   specifications.         Note: Some USB peripheral devices not manufactured by Apple may have   unique power requirements. These may exceed the power allotment on an   individual USB port. Those devices may require you connect them to   multiple USB ports or may have external power sources that must be   present for them to function.      Apple peripheral devices may request more than 500 mA (Milliamps) at 5   V (Volts) from a port to function or to allow for faster charging.   Such Apple peripheral devices include:         Apple MacBook Air SuperDrive (when connected to supported computers)   Aluminum Wired Keyboard*   iPod   iPhone   iPad         To meet requests for additional power from these Apple peripherals and   devices, some Apple computers and displays can provide up to 1100 mA   at 5 V (thatâ€™s 5.5 W of power (5 V Ã— 1.1 A = 5.5 W)) through the   port to which the Apple peripheral or device is connected.   (That certainly explains why Appleâ€™s External SuperDrive can be easily powered by just one port!)  Based on that, it seems like it would be impossible to power OWCâ€™s Slim drives with just one USB port. In fact, Iâ€™m kind of curious how it can even be powered with two! Considering itâ€™s supposed to be a USB 2.0 device, it should only come with a USB 2.0 cable (as mentioned in this Apple FAQ, you need to be using USB 3 cables (with USB 3 peripherals) to get the 400 mA increase in current over USB 2.0 cables). Considering that using two USB 2.0 ports will only provide 5 W of power (2.5 W from each port) while the OWC drives mentioned above require 6.3 W, I donâ€™t see how they can be bus-powered (at least under USB 2.0).  Iâ€™ll contact OWC to find out what the discrepancy is (could be as simple as having a typo on their knowledge base page showing the power draw), but hopefully, the rest of the information here can help narrow your search down considerably.
Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Retina display  Positive:   Available in Germany Works with OS X and Linux 1649â‚¬ with the specs you want 8 GB DDR3 RAM 256 GB SSD (really fast: over 1.5 GB/s read and write) 1.58 kg 10 hours of web surfing 2560x1600 display 13.3-inch screen Wi-Fi ac (over 1.3 Gbit/s; I have tested it myself) Silent under normal workload D-SUB/VGA (via Thunderbolt adapter) Good keyboard German keyboard Backlit keyboard SD card reader RJ45 (via Thunderbolt adapter) Anti-reflective display USB 3.0 Aluminium case Webcam / microphone Bluetooth 4.0   Negative:   Only 2 USB ports (extendable via Thunderbolt; never was an issue for me) No DVD/Blu-ray player (never needed one) No Matte display (anti-reflective) No NVIDIA GPU No numpad No USB 3.1   I don't think there will be any special pricing in the near future.

I recommend the Pioneer 6x Silver External Slim Portable USB 3.0 BD/DVD/CD Burner Model BDR-XD05S, currently $85 + $2 shipping at newegg.com.  It is compatible with USB 3 Super Speed mode, which virtually guarantees the burner will work at full, rated speed. It does, however, require a second USB port if the drive is connected via USB 2.  If price is a issue, the SAMSUNG USB 2.0 Slim Portable Blu-ray Writer ($70 + $2 shipping at newegg.com) is a cheaper option that lacks support for quad layer Blu-ray (according to newegg anyway) and amd USB Super Speed.  It's a single port model, which means that you won't have any trouble with compatibility. Unfortunately, it only supports USB 2.0 (High Speed), so if you were burning a movie, it could take a while.
Some time ago I've successfully installed Linux (ROSA R3) on the similar Acer ICONIA Tab W500.  Currently there are Linux installations on 3 different ICONIA Tab W500, W501, W501P and W700 in the database. And there are no any information for other tablets you listed. So I can recommend you the Acer tablet.  However please don't expect that all Linux applications will support touchscreen interface. Most of the time you will work with your Linux tablet as a traditional laptop via the keyboard and mouse.
T100TA and X205TA are both of Bay Trail-T architecture, that is not properly supported by Linux yet. Actually they are not laptops, they are tablets. You'd better to look at Asus VivoBook X202E, HP Pavilion TouchSmart 11z or Asus Q200 which are traditional laptops. Also you can dual-boot almost any chrome-book with your Linux.  Please check your final choice against this database of Linux-supported computers: http://linux-hardware.org/index.php?view=computers&type=notebook  I've found Linux report for ASUS X202EP in the database (https://linux-hardware.org/?probe=4d608145e3) and some HP touchsmart models (tm2, tx2).
I would suggest the Denon AC-GC20.   About 300â‚¬ in Germany Over-Ear Detachable cable Bluetooth Smart Supports modern codecs aptX Low Latency (High quality audio over Bluetooth) Active noise canceling (can be turned off) Dual mode (connect two devices at the same time) Very good sound quality and frequency response 20h playback time (Bluetooth) usable with dead battery   I highly recommend these headphones to everyone who asks my for recommendations for headphones in general. I was searching for Bluetooth headphones myself and they are the only ones that feature everything I could ask for.
I'll recommend the 16GB Nexus 7 (2013 model) at $130 from Amazon.   It runs any version of Android; I believe current versions are shipping with Lollipop and can easily be upgraded to Marshmallow. It's got a 320 dpi IPS screen.  Colors start darkening at about 30 degrees off-axis in all four directions (measured using the tablet's orientation sensor) and the screen remains readable up to about 70 degrees off-axis.  I did not notice a color shift at any angle.
The Asus Xtion Pro Live is a decent kinect-like sensor, can be powered via usb and is considerably smaller -especially since there is way less cable mess- it is 500$ on amazon. The range is only 3.5 meters however.  http://www.amazon.com/Asus-Xtion-PRO-LIVE-90IW0122-B01UA/dp/B00CET0ZBO https://www.asus.com/us/3D-Sensor/Xtion_PRO_LIVE/  I worked with the sensor in an "object recognition" project and had no problems.
Red Bear labs has quite a few options. I have used the Blend micro and didn't encounter any problems. I am fairly certain you can change the name too.  http://redbearlab.com/blendmicro/  They also have smaller/larger models
I would recommend the Amazon Fire 10" Wi-Fi 16GB which starts at $179.99 but you may be able to find it cheaper.    This features an HD display of 1280x800 and quoting from the Amazon website:     Fire HD 10 features a widescreen 1280 x 800 high definition display with over a million pixels (149 ppi) for a bright, vivid picture. Enjoy a great viewing experience with wide viewing angles, less glare, blacker blacks and more brightness thanks to a fully laminated IPS (in-plane switching) LCD display.   People say the screen quality is great, the reviews praise it for having great screen quality1 and for having a low price    This StackExchange question on Android SE, describes how you can install Vanilla Android on a Fire tablet. This does require a root which you may do if you are comfortable with it.
Use an active-splitter with VGA cables. With a long length on one end, you will need active electronics.  VGA is analog. The quality of your picture is going to depend on the quality of the cable you use and the electronics on your video card and monitor. With a decent quality cable of 20 meters, I would expect a good quality picture at 1024*768 resolution and 60 Hz.  Use a splitter similar to this model and a cable similar to this Monoprice 75-foot product. The reviews on these products suggest this is feasible.
DVI  If your budget isn't too tight (< $40) then I would recommend DVI.  As for all cables, signal quality is dependent on the length of the cable. VGA cables are much more susceptible to degradation due to distance1 so I would highly recommend against VGA.   While cable quality may play a role, VGA is very old-school and DVI is better than it in almost every way. Your result is also dependent on your resolution. At your range you're probably going to be able to run a 1,280 Ã— 1,024 display, and you may need a booster the longer you go.  I would definitely note that 55ft would require a rather very long cable. (~75ft). This means that cables can get expensive quickly, especially the higher you go in terms of quality  If you choose to get an extender (link to one such extender), you'll be able to use really any cable and get flawless video. If you're running CICS, then I wouldn't see any benefit to an extender.  A Few Links  These were found from a quick google search. You might want to look at more options and reviews for other cables. Shorter cables would be preferable but 75ft is the most common option above 50ft   75ft Tripp (Amazon) $76 75ft Cmple (Amazon) $57   All of these seem to perform to the required resolution.    There many more, doing a google search for 65ft or 55ft DVI cable yells quite a few results
HDMI extender  The kind when you have 2 small boxes to be connected with pair of Ethernet-style cables. I'm using Unitek Y-5115 (I've paid about $30-$40), but this one looks promising. I think this simple devices work by having an analog amplifier pump the signal into cheap cable and then normalize it at the other end - it doesn't really understand the protocol so it works with pretty much anything that can be crammed into HDMI cable. I've tested mine with pair of 25m patchcords and it worked flawlessly up to 1080p and also with DVI. In your case you can connect it via DVI-splitter to the DVI monitor.  UPDATE: I've tried mine at 4k, but it only managed to work on 20cm patch cords. Anything longer and there was no signal. But still - I was amazed that the extender itself did worked at 4k even though it's specced up to FullHD.  The biggest advantage of this system is that all the expensive parts (the converters themselves) are concentrated in 2 small locations and can be put out of harm's way. The long cable is cheap and can be easily trimmed or replaced should a need arise. Also the transmission is fully digital (although I suspect analog amplification) so you get perfect quality.  I'd recommend against long VGA, DVI or HDMI cable - simply because they are quite expensive and when they get damaged you have to replace entire length of it. The picture quality degradation of VGA cable is less of an issue, as I've witnessed surprisingly good quality out of about 15-20m cables used at conference rooms - although judging by the thickness they were probably quite expensive.  As with all experiments, I advise you make the purchases as a consumer (that is, not as company or organization) so you can return it if you're not satisfied with results.
Anything with DisplayPort 1.2 or better, eg Intel NUC NUC6i5SYH or NUC6i3SYK.  DisplayPort daisy-chaining allows for up to 5 monitors connected to a single DP socket.
I am using Unitek Y-5115 with 15m cables for 2 years now and it just works. I suspect that the 2*ethernet cable extenders simply use analog amplification of a digital signal (number of pairs in 2 ethernet cables > number of pairs in HDMI cable), so even other format still pass (eg DVI, I've tried) and no loss of quality is possible (until eventually digital connection breaks down).  Mind you that there are now extenders which use only 1 ethernet cable so they must work in a different way - I am NOT talking about them.  (BTW, the cable you mean is not really RJ45 and a real RJ45 plug wouldn't even fit the socket.)
For programming the most botlenecking happens, when the content of RAM gets dumped to pagefile. So the priority should be at least 8 GB of RAM (especially with VMs - if you ran two, 16GB would be better), next the SSD - in my experience, the processor does not bottleneck while programming as much as IO operations.  I would consider Lenovo B50-80 family of products: they can be found under the budget, having an ssd drive and magnetic one and 8 GB of RAM. It has 15.6 screen which matters, unless you plug to external monitor, and you can choose to have either i3-4030U, i5-5200U, or i7-5500U processor depending on your budget.   Hovewer, if you do not need DVD and like 13 inch display, the best fitting laptop would be Dell Latitude 3340 13.3" i3 4005U 8GB RAM 128GB SSD Windows 8. It has SSD drive, no bloat DVD or graphics card, is much thicker and a bit lighter (1.8 kg due to huge 5800 mAh battery I guess), can handle up to 16GB of RAM and it's Dell, so it'll live for years. The downside is 41$ + shipping above the budget.
PocketChip (http://getchip.com/pages/pocketchip) may satisfy your needs, but may be overkill. It has a very small QWERTY keyboard, a 4.3" screen and a battery, for $50. It is not clear whether the USB output is exposed or not, only the GPIO is mentioned...  The other gotcha is that it has not been released yet, and there is no specific launch date for it yet (the board itself will start to ship in May 2016).
I am using 2 of the BenQ GL2450H(T) and I am very satisfied with them, 60 Hertz is enough for every game and with 24 Inches you can see clearly everything. It(Mine) has a HDMI-Input, DVI and VGA.  I would definitely recommand this one. I have never heard of the other one though so I can't tell anything about it.
There is an energy-saving version of the FX8320, it just has an E at the End of it's name: FX8320E.  A 1200W-PSU is far enough for a 150W-GPU and a 105W-CPU, a smaller one like 650W-730W would also be far enough.  Also I wouldn't mix a AMD-CPU with a nVidia-GPU but nearly everybody says, that this doesn't do anything. The rest is fine. I don't know anythin about Thermaltake though and in my opinion nVidia is overpriced, so I would recommend Radeon on all times but that's my personal opinion.  EDIT:  I am using the FX-8320E for 4-5 Months now and I'm very satisfied with it.
The RAM you've selected is incompatible with the rest of your parts.  It is ECC (stores extra data in order to detect memory errors) registered (uses a special circuit to reduce the amount of power needed to drive signals) memory, while the CPU and mainboard you've selected only support regular (non-ECC, non-registered) memory.
It depends on a couple of factors:   Does your MacBook already have an SSD? Are you using your VMs for disk and memory-intensive operations?   In general, yes, an SSD and more memory will speed up VMs.  For me, switching to SSD provided a greater performance benefit than any other single upgrade I've ever done.  If your MacBook already has SSD, a newer/bigger/faster SSD isn't going to make much difference.  RAM will only make a difference if it gets used, which depends entirely on how much you have, how much is allocated to the VMs, what operating systems they will have, and what programs you run in the VMs.  4 GB sounds like not much RAM to be using VMs, especially if you're trying to run more than one at a time.
As Paul Taylor already mentioned, Lenovo X220 was chosen.  According to the OP's requirements:  â˜‘ Dislay: 12.5" (1366x768, LED backlight, wideview, anti-glare, anti-reflective)  â˜‘ Weight: 3.5 pounds with 6-cell battery (~1.6 kg)  â˜‘ X220 will handle popular Linux distros with ease (Source 1, Source 2).   â˜’ Most often X220 has Windows on the board but it can be also (in specific cases) available without an operating system (related link).  â˜‘ Powerful enough to learn programming and play simple games  â˜‘ SSD is available in some builds (up to 160 GB - datasheet).  â˜‘ It's in your budget    Some of the people don't really like the gritty touchpad but you can replace it on your own for ~$13.  This topic may be useful.     I have found a very perfect solution for the ones that do not like the   touchpads on newer Thinkpads. On my Thinkpad T400s i just peeled of   the old surface, which is just a sticker, cleaned of the glue by   rubbbing it off with my finger, and then put on a new smooth   touchpadsurface from the company skinstyler   and     I recently replaced the worn gritty touchpad on my Lenovo T420S.      For those wondering around this I have attached a pic.   http://1drv.ms/1pacMv8      Process was easy, and removing the existing skin remarkably easy. My   pad was pre-cut according to T420S size. I would recommend doing it -   the old worn pads do look tacky.   Protection skin mentioned in the topic is available here.  Related video
So far I haven't found anything that beats my Thinkpads X201s and a 14" T61 (4:3 aspect ratio) for my own needs (mostly programming as well), so I'd recommend that.  They're pretty cheap nowadays on ebay.  Anything more recent will have a ridiculously short screen (they call them "wide" for the gullibles) which means you need to get a bigger and heavier machine in order to keep the same number of code lines on screen.
For a 80-Plus Platinum power supply, efficiencies are between around 5% of one another between the 20 to 100% range of load(88-92, give or take a percent). It tops at around 70% load.  Having more than required is certainly not a bad thing. PSU's like the HCP are rated to deliver their full wattage at fairly high temperatures, and 300W is enough for any card.  So go ahead, you're good to make the purchase. Hardware reviewers use oversized power supplies all the time, and nothing happens to them.
This build needs work.  You should wait out on buying AMD CPU's atleast till Zen comes out. They've just been re-releasing the same chip by overclocking it, and the 8320 is a slow chip. It's even slower than the 8350, which is the go-to chip for gaming AMD builds.  Also, because of a different architecture, AMD CPU's with a given frequency are far slower than Intel CPU's with the same frequency. AFAIK a 5GHz FX-8350 is comparable to a i5-4690K at stock(3.5 GHz). A normal 8350 is the equivalent of a mid-level i5 at best. I'd recommend a i5 4690K for gaming, you don't need 8 cores.   A GTX 970 consumes 145W of power. No way it'll need a 850W power supply. Maybe, if you're adding 3 cards in SLI, but not otherwise.   Thermaltake power supplies aren't that great, especially the older TR2 models. Get Antec or Seasonic, 80+ Gold rated power supplies. 750W should be enough for a fairly high end build. I recommend Seasonic.  For the motherboard, MSI is cheap, but not that great(power delivery circuitry is inferior to some brands). I'd recommend a Asus or Gigabyte Z97 based board. Get a Asus Z97-A or a Gigabyte Z97X Gaming 5, it'll allow you to add another 970 when you want.  As for the case, it looks mostly OK, except for the back panel. Do you have experience with this case? It seems that there is low clearance on the upper side of the motherboard from the back, which chould pinch cables; although it's hard to say from images without actually looking at it. If you're looking at a case that won't cost too much money, I'd recommend the Corsair Carbide 300R, 400R or 500R. They're also mid-tower, and a 300R should come at the same price as yours.  As for the above answer from TesseractLabs, the AMD CPU/NVidia GPU and vice versa is all a myth. All of those are compatible. Although, if you go for a AMD FX CPU, you won't get integrated graphics. Both Intel and AMD CPUs are fine with AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, although you can't use both NVIDIA and AMD GPU's in the same PC yet.
Professional video cards are the best for your work load as they will be optimized for things such as video editing.   From Nvidia, there is the Quadro K420. From AMD there is the FirePro W2100. Both cards will be able to work with the GPU render acceleration in Vegas and both support use of 2+ monitors through DisplayPort, or adapters to convert the DisplayPort to other connectors. The K420 also provides native DVI-D with a cable that has two ports on it.   The W2100 has 320 cores, while the K420 has 192. These cores are an integral part of the performance of the GPU because they are what GPU accelerated processes use to perform tasks. The W2100 also has twice the VRAM, which allows more data to be stored on the card while it is processing, which prevents the need to constantly pass data over the PCIe bus. Speaking of which, the K420 has ever so slightly higher memory bandwidth (29GBps vs. 28.8GBps), but this difference is negligible. The W2100 also uses PCIe 3.0, whereas the K420 uses PCIe 2.0. This means the W2100 is capable of passing data over the PCIe bus faster than the K420.  All in all, the W2100 is a better card at the price point, however if you have a preference for Nvidia cards, or want native DVI-D, the K420 may be a better choice for you.
Sony Vega Pro's hardware acceleration uses OpenCL compute. Generally, the consumer cards have similar performance for quite a bit cheaper, as seen in the benchmark below.   OpenCL has also typically performed better on AMD cards, compared to NVidia cards    I recommend the XFX R7 370 2GB Double Dissipation Video Card (R7-370P-2255), currently priced $124.99 + $3.99 shipping at newegg.com, due to the fact that it has more than 3 times the stream processors running at a higher clockspeed, and that it uses GDDR5 rather than DDR3, which makes it quite a bit faster for Sony Vegas Pro, and for other applications, than the similarly priced W2100 and K420 workstation GPUs.
I recommend the 4 GB Sapphire Nitro R9 380, currently 1000 RON with free shipping at Emag.ro. The R9 380 is able to average around 30 FPS on most modern games at 1080p maximum settings.  The Sapphire Nitro is the highest end line of Sapphire GPUs and are made with high quality components. It has a 5+1 phase VRM and good cooling, so you should be able to overclock it a fair bit as well. 4 GB of VRAM can store larger textures and could come in handy for modern games. Unfortunately, the card does not come with native VGA, so you'll have to use your adaptor.  Another option would be a GTX 960, such as the 4 GB Gigabyte Windforce 2X, 1024 RON at dc-shop.ro. The two cards trade blows, and the only reason I've recommended the Nitro R9 380 is because it was a top-of-the-line model on sale right now for fairly cheap. You'd probably be able to overclock more with the GTX 960, and the lower power consumption will save money in the long run, but really, it's up to personal preference. The 960 doesn't have a VGA port either.  If you really wanted to play at max settings at 1080p though, consider spending a bit more and get a R9 390, such as the 8 GB Sapphire Nitro Tri-X, 1569.99 RON at Emag.ro. It would easily handle any current game on your monitor, even with the eye candy right up. Even if you decided to get 2 more monitors to play triple monitor (exactly between the number of pixels of QHD (2x) and UHD (4x)), it would still meet your FPS requirements with ease. Be warned though, this card can draw almost 350 W of power! If you don't want or need a GPU this powerful, I suggest you recycle some of your budget. An extra 100 for the CPU and 300 for the SSD should get you some better options.
Finally, I opted for a different model, because it seems to have better support for Japanese language (which I also needed). However, for more general cases I think @Andy's answer is the best choice.    I bought this Japanese Bluetooth wireless trackball keyboard: Miyoshi's TK-BT01
AKG Y50 are your friends:   Detacheable cable low price ~100â‚¬ dedicated, clear sound quality comfortable even for longer use
According to Intel ARK on the IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7-5930K Processor:    Max Memory Size (dependent on memory type): 64 GB Memory Types: DDR4 1333/1600/2133 Max # of Memory Channels: 4 Max Memory Bandwidth: 68GB/s  ECC Memory Supported: No   So, I won't be able to use 128 GB.
Estimating what you will need without having a working system to extrapolate from is very, very difficult.  If you must do so, you need to have a very well defined use case.  From that, you should be able to extrapolate the necessary tables, queries, frequency of access, etc., and come up with ballpark CPU, disk size, and disk performance characteristics (IOPS and throughput).  Unfortunately, the way most people do it these days is they get the basic system working first, test the system with X users and then extrapolate what would be needed for Y users.  Database scale is generally fairly linear if the schema and code are written well.  Then when the requirements change (which seems to happen much faster than servers get depreciated), they upgrade or downgrade servers to compensate. This is where AWS and other cloud providers shine because if you're constantly changing what you need, it's much easier to switch systems if you don't own the hardware.  Here are some hints for capacity planning:   If the vast majority of disk access isn't writes or your cache hit ratio is less than 99.5%, you don't have enough RAM.  Average Page Life is also an important metric SQL server does writes in batches every minute or so.  It will max out your disk IOPS no matter how many IOPS your system has during that time.  The thing to look at is how long the flushing lasts relative to the period between the flushes Logical disk reads often appear as CPU usage (because the pages are in cache), and may indicate the need for an index Database data files should be on separate drive sets from other files and IOPS is generally the most important factor for these drives.  Temp database should probably also be on it's own drive set and IOPS is also most important here.  Log files are on yet another drive set, but throughout is most important for this set
There are many chipsets with the LGA 1151 socket, including the Z170, B150, H170 etc. The only chipset that allows overclocking would be the Z170 chipset, which you should get since you are getting a overclockable CPU. The other chipsets I mentioned are cheaper (sub $100 range) but lack some of the features the Z170 has. Even with the same chipset, there are higher quality motherboards (more expensive) and lower quality motherboard (cheaper). The higher quality motherboards have more features such as better power delivery to allow more overclocking, better NICs, better sound cards, more PCIe slots, etc. The motherboard you would need would depend on what you are using it for.  A $60 motherboard would be "good enough" for you. You would not be able to overclock if it's not a Z170 chipset (so the overclockability of your CPU is wasted), it probably doesn't have SLI and/or CrossFireX support, so you would be limited to only having one GPU. The PCIe lanes could also be slower, so higher bandwidth PCIe cards would take a performance hit.  The speed of the RAM doesn't have to correspond to the motherboard's rated max speed. The RAM would run at the lower speed of the two (e.g. if your RAM was 3000MHz and your board only supports max of 2400MHz, it would run at the lower of the two, which would be 2400MHz). This also means you are wasting some of the power of the RAM if you buy a lower end board. You would also want to check with your motherboard manufacturer's manual to check if the RAM is compatible with your board.
I'd say you go with the 960.  The reason is that the 960 is a newer architecture, and is still going to be available if you decide you're going to add another 960 in SLI.  Bus memory is a consideration, but the way you're seeing it is not correct; there's more to it than that. For example, if you have a bus width that is more, but the memory tech is older (DDR3 instead of GDDR5), it automatically cuts the total memory bandwidth you gain in half. Depending on the memory clock, you may actually get worse performance with the DDR3 card, even though it has more bus width.  Now, I agree the bus width of the 960 is lower, and both cards are GDDR5. But the newer Maxwell architecture of the 960 utilizes a color-compression technology that increases its effective bandwidth by around 28%, bringing it closer to the 760's. It also uses a newer anti-aliasing algorithm(MFAA) that is far less resource-intensive than MSAA that you'll have to use on the 760, again requiring lesser memory bandwidth.  That said, I ask you this: what is the resolution you're using on your monitor? If it's 1920x1080(i.e. 1080p), the 960 will handle it irrespective of all these theoretical specifications. It's been designed to run modern games with that resolution in mind, and it's also more power efficient(176 W of power for the 760 vs 120 W for the 960), so the 760 runs 82C at full load and is loud, whereas the 960 never breaches 60 and is very quiet(both are very good things).
I haven't personally used CUDA for this, though I am planning to. From my research I concluded, that you for sure want to have 'Computing Capability' at least equal to 3.5, as some libraries requre it already. The (tough to find) list of computing capability is under this link. From this list one can conclude, that having GTX 980 or Titan (both 5.2 score) is as good as you can get, but note, that if you are buing a graphics card only for this, Nvidia has an answer for professional and academic use named Tesla - it's just a computing box, far from graphics card (it has no display ports even!), costs from 3k $ for K20, to 5k $ for K80 model, and is a behemoth:  A quick comparision (CC stands for Compute Capability):   Tesla K20: for desktops, peek for float: 3.52 Tflops, 5 GB, 2496 CUDA cores, 2.9 k $, CC: 3.5 Tesla  K40: for desktops, peek for float: 4.29 Tflops, 12 GB, 2880 CUDA cores, 3.1k $, CC: 3.5 Tesla  K80: for servers, peek for float: 8 Tflops, 24 GB,  4992 CUDA Cores, 5k $, CC: 3.7   and customer grade, most popular and new graphics cards:   GTX960: for desktops, peek for float: 2.3 Tflops, 2 or 4 GB, 1024 CUDA cores, 200$, CC: 5.2 GTX980: for desktops, peek for float: 4.61 Tflops, 4 GB, 2048 CUDA cores, 500$, CC: 5.2 Titan X: for desktops, peek for float: 6.1 Tflops, 12 GB, 3072 CUDA cores, 1000$, CC: 5.2   Also see comparision on wccftech.  To conclude: the commercial grade GPU seem to be more cost efficient, but only when we compare the specs. There can be other trade-offs, I am not awere of. Thus, I cannot confidently say "go with customer grade", but I can tell you what I would (will) do - I will buy GTX 960 or 970, because I plan on gaming and I'm quite cost limited, and this cards will do just fine for CUDA learning. If you buy for an institution, do not plan gaming, the calculations will go 24/7, consider the academic grade Teslas.   Also, if you'll be interested in boosting your 'conventional' integer based processing power on a high-end computation server, you may want to look up Xeon phi.   [EDIT] Please note, that switching from CPU based floating point arithmetic to GPU enchanced, is a change in quality, almost one order of magnitute, and will be very pronounced and noticible, but switching from ex. Tesla K20 to Tesla K40 will be just a change in quantity (K80 is just two K40 bundled together), so if you go for speed to price ratio, go with cheapest GPU acceleration, that'll work for you.
To use SATA Express, you would need to use a SSD that supports SATA Express. I'm currently not aware of a SSD that supports SATA Express. It does have a much higher theoretical speed than SATA and would be good for SSDs. I would still recommend a SSD through PCIe or M.2 (which uses PCIe internally).
What you are saying is not overclocking. Overclocking is pushing a device over it's specified limits, so if you made the 3000MHz RAM sticks run at 4000MHz, then it would be overclocked. Motherboards will run all DDR4 RAM at 2133MHz (base speed for DDR4) to improve compatibility. To run RAM at their specified speed you would need to enable XMP (Extreme Memory Profile) in the BIOS.  To choose for RAM with your motherboard, check with the manual of your motherboard for the specific model of your RAM for compatibility.
If you are using this computer purely for gaming, the CPU and motherboard doesn't matter as much as the GPU. All you need is a current generation CPU with a compatible motherboard and you should spend more on the GPU. Games will run basically the same on the 4 CPU's you listed, so my recommendation would be to get the cheaper one you can find. For the Intel CPU's I would recommend a H97 or a Z97 chipset motherboard, so just buy one from a reputable brand and reviews and is budget friendly. For the AMD CPU's I would recommend a AM3+ socket motherboard, just get a cheap one from a reputable brand and reviews.
The A10 laptop is enough for you. In reality, the two laptops are very similar except the Intel one may run a little faster and produce less heat and have longer battery life. For programming and normal day to day tasks, the A10 is plenty enough.
SSDs should never be slower than a HDD, especially in small files. The reason is because of how they work. A HDD uses a spinning platter and a read/write head for information access where a SSD uses a controller with flash chips. When reading/writing files, the HDD has to wait for the head to align with the platter before it can be accessed, but a SSD doesn't have to wait.   In my experience I would only recommend a Sandisk SSD for their reliability, and nothing else. Write speeds are usually less important than read speeds, because if you think about it, you are mostly doing reading of files rather than writing of files. The Samsung SSD will provide significant improvement over the Sandisk ones so I would recommend the Samsung one. You can also look into SSDs from other manufacturers that can be cheaper without sacrificing much performance, such as A-Data, Kingston or Crucial.
It looks like your case has standard front-panel audio.  If that's correct, it makes finding compatible front-panel bays much easier.  The cheapest 5.25" bay I've been able to find is this $40 bay from Kingwin, which in addition to two USB 3.0 ports and HD audio, has an eSATA port, an everything-under-the-sun card reader, two fan controllers, and a temperature display.  However, 3.5" -> 5.25" bay adapters are cheap and easy to find.  With one of those, a $20 3.5" bay from Silverstone gets you four USB 2.0 ports, HD audio, and a FireWire port (or if you don't care about looks, $18 gets you the same thing in silver); $25 from Silverstone gets you four USB 3.0 ports and HD audio.  I don't have any experience with these, but Silverstone has a decent reputation, and a simple front-panel port is difficult to mess up -- it's just a bunch of wires soldered to the appropriate jack, with no electronics involved.
Vertical mouse is OK only if you never take your dominant hand off the mouse. Regular users tend to keep moving their hand between mouse and keyboard. Vertical mouse is very bad for this as it takes extra time and effort to both let it go and grab back again. Trackballs are bit better, but if you do follow the common click-click-type-type-click-clik pattern then regular mouse is the best.  The exercise of moving your hand back and forth between mouse and keyboard already is the best thing for your health. Super-ergonomic mice solve a problem that you don't have.  I recommend that you buy regular mouse (eg Logitech RX250, around $15). To be blunt: for regular users regular stuff usually works best : ) Consider better mouse when you have the money to burn.   If you insist on buying one of the mentioned products then check out customer rights in your (and store) jurisdiction. In many places you are entitled to return a product bought online after a short time simply because you don't like it. This is exactly the situation lawmakers had in mind. Yet, I think you really should buy a decent, entry-level mouse first. At least as a backup plan.
I'd try these ones from eBay:   3.5'' to 5.25'' Drive Bay Computer Case Adapter Mounting Bracket USB Hub Floppy 20Pin To 2 Port USB 3.0 HUB And HD Audio 3.5-in PC Floppy Front Panel Cable      The adapter is $3 the front panel is ~$11 although shipping usually is not too fast from Hong Kong.  I have a similar front panel (without audio). The USB 3.0 ports work well for me.
I'm just looking for a good base computer that I can play some sims on   that I can upgrade as I go.   Than your best bet is going with latest mobo and cheapest processor for this chipset (1151 in this case, codenamed skylake). That way, in years to come, the i7-6700 processor can be much cheaper, not to mention other processors that will come for this chipset (Cannonlake and Kaby Lake).  Intel Core i5-6400 @ 2.70GHz has a mark of 6,517 points on cpubenchmark and Intel Core i3-4170 @ 3.70GHz has 5,166 points. Which means, that their performance is comparable in multitasking, with i5-6400 slightly better.  The difference is in number of physical cores, and speed obviously. The i3-4170 has two physical cores, while i5-6400 has four. The Intel HyperThreading technology allows a processor to reclaim some (!) of unused processing time of cores that are idle, or to be more precise, the instructions on the core, that are not used (the performance gain is close to 20%). This means, that for multithreading you are far better with i5-6400, and for quick, single threaded tasks, with i3-4170. Please consult the question & answers on Superuser about Intel HyperThreading.  For the game Sims 3, either will perform greatly. Which does not necessairly mean, that you should go with cheaper one - investing in Skylake platform will make your build much more 'future-proof', and it's what I would reccomend.  Also, as you mention lagging in Sims 3 - consider posting a qestion about graphics card for this, becasue I suspect, that the graphics bottlenecks (and will bottleneck, if you wont buy a graphic card in your new setup).
Just about any front panel audio will work for you. I merely searched for "audio 5.25" and found this product for $14 (customs and VAT may apply). It fulfills exactly your requirements and nothing more. It's also worth noting it's "HD audio" - that's the most recent spec of connecting audio jacks to mainboard (the part that makes your computer detect plugging of jacks and let you decide in software what function will it perform).  However if you're really after simply replicating AUX jack from the back of your computer, then products like this archaeological artifact are surprisingly still available. The point is visible on the last pic: those cables doesn't even connect to internal mainboard ports at all! They're just "dumb" male jack to female jack extension cords. If you have such special needs, they will trick your computer into thinking that something is always plugged in, even if there is nothing attached to the front panel. Fun fact: it will even work just as well on the desk, outside of your computer.  Side note: as your case has bay door that will block access to front panels, maybe regular extension cords: a pair for headphones/mic and another for USB, plugged into back will serve your purposes better?  Yet another thought: many monitors have USB hubs and audio out (from HDMI) jack. There is a slight possibility you already have everything you need : )
The Atom line of CPU's require the CPU to be permanently soldered to the motherboard, which limits choices and flexibility/upgradability. As far as I'm aware, getting a motherboard with a Atom chip built in is very hard to find and is possibly not cheap. If you can find a board with Atom built in that is cheap, it will perform about as well or just as well as a E3 in your tasks. It will also use much less electricity and produce much less heat than a E3. If you plan on upgrading later or want it to perform other more intensive tasks, then you might want to look into the E3 line.
If all these 4 coolers are the same price, I would recommend the H100i. It is a very powerful closed loop CPU cooler (I have done some serious overclock with this cooler). Since you got a overclockable CPU, if you want to overclock in the future you can do that with this cooler no problem. The new Skylake CPUs have a thinner PCB, so heavy CPU coolers can actually bend the chip (not a good thing). Since all the other choices are really heavy tower coolers, the H100i can prevent the CPU from bending.
I just want to be able to play all my expansions I have about 5 expansions and on my current set up I can only play 2 expansions without horrible lag times.   The recommendation could be better if you include the specifications of the computer that has the lags in your question, so we can analyze where the bottleneck in your current setup is and if the newer hardware would be a substantial improvement.  That being said, The Sims 3 was released in 2009, is based on DirectX 9 and has moderate hardware requirements. A fairly obvious case one might say?  Core i3-4170 vs. Core i5-6400 GPU  For comparison of Intel GPUs there is a separate article in Wikipedia that gives a really useful overview, combined with the data in the lists for all the Intel processors (list-type Wikipedia links are/were banned on some SE sites, but they are not hard to find) we get this:   Core i3-4170 GPU runs at 350â€“1150 MHz, TDP 54 W     HD Graphics 4200, 4400, 4600, P4600, P4700 â€“ GT2, 20 execution units, up to 432 GFLOPS at 1350 MHz  Core i5-6400 GPU runs at 350â€“950 MHz, TDP 65 W     HD Graphics 530, GT2 â€“ 24 execution units, up to 441.6 GFLOPS at 1.15 GHz  For comparison, the GPU of the Ivy Brigde CPU I have in my T530:     HD Graphics 4000 â€“ 16 execution units and additional features, up to 332.8 GFLOPS at 1300 MHz    So just by looking at the GFLOPS, there isn't really any difference between both models but about 30% increase over the older generation.  DirectX 9 in 2015 how hard could it be?  Just for a test I ran Tomb Raider (2013, DirectX 11) on the laptops GPU. By lowering the graphics settings I was able to play, but I am much less finicky about lags. With that in mind I thought DOA5:LR based on DirectX 9 in 2015 released on PC would run smooth, but I was wrong. I wouldn't wave off GPU demands so easily anymore. Chances that Sims 3 will run fine however are pretty good, especially when looking at this section from the recommendations:     For computers using built-in graphics chipsets under Windows, the game requires at least:  Intel Integrated Chipset, GMA 3-Series or above 2.6 GHz Pentium D CPU, or 1.8 GHz Core 2 Duo, or equivalent 0.5 GB additional RAM    Both of your options outperform these requirements, but it's hard to tell which level of detail can be achieved and it doesn't look like there is enough headroom for newer games like Sims 4. If I was a Sims fan and had to buy a new computer today to play Sims 3, I'd make sure that it would also run Sims 4 from 2014, which is still based on DirectX 9, has moderate requirements for 2014, but is much more demanding in terms of GPU power. DOA5:LR is still a different game, but let's say I have doubts when I read the following in the minimal requirements:     GeForce 6600 or better, ATI Radeon X1300 or better, Intel GMA X4500 or better   If you still want to go APU only for Sims 3, then it's fine, for Sims 4 I would consider looking at AMD's APU offerings in similar price ranges. They are not very competitive compared to Intel's high performance offerings and their latest desktop CPUs are from 2014, but their iGPUs are said to have significantly more power (1, 2) and the CPU part still manages to run games too.  Upgrading CPUs  I think Piotr is wrong when he says:     That way, in years to come, the i7-6700 processor can be much cheaper, not to mention other processors that will come for this chipset (Cannonlake and Kaby Lake).   I would like to see more facts, preferably in the market where you are/the OP is. My experience here in Europe/Germany is that prices for Intel processors are very stable after the spike at launch and opportunities for a bargain offer are minimal if you want to avoid buying used hardware (from users where you don't know how they treat their hardware).  Also buying any board with a Skylake compatible chipset appears more like a bad idea when you look at how many products a chipset family has today and how quickly Intel changed sockets in the last years or which features were missing and were only added to the next generation (no native USB 3.0 for example, and it looks like Skylake and Kaby Lake will have the same thing for 3.1). By now it should be very clear to everyone that Intel is releasing features successively and moving from a tick-tock to a tick-tick-tock model or something different. At any point you will not get the full feature set to be future-proof until the next better thing appears on a roadmap. This is pretty disappointing for long time upgrade strategies, but Intel can relax when it comes to selling single processors currently, they have to focus on marketing entire platforms (all devices where you don't usually upgrade the CPU) and to be fair platforms have increased in complexity so it's not only ill will that we can't go back to the good old Socket 478 or earlier days.
After reading this suggested question, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 seems like it might be a good fit.  GSMArena specs look promising, though I'm not sure if it has a removable battery yet.  I wasn't even familiar with this brand of phone, but apparently they're a big manufacturer.
Have you heard about O2+ODAC by NwAvGuy? After some evaluation of products in the market at around 2012 he started his own DIY project for a headphone amplifier (the O2) and later retrofitted a DAC into the design (ODAC, both together make up O2+ODAC). It's a USB Audio Class I device and therefore runs on a lot of platforms out of the box that support USB audio unlike some other devices that require USB Audio Class II, which is not supported in Windows without special drivers.  JDS Labs is one of the companies that offers DIY kits for O2 if you want to build the amplifier yourself but don't want to look deeper into the bill of materials (BOM). They also made a revision with compatibility improvments to the original design based on their customers experience and they have a few other interesting articles on their blog.  If you are looking for something more portable or something bigger with even more power they offer Amp+DAC products like C5D and The Element in their shop. I was uncertain when my EL-8 arrived this year about which product to buy without spending insane amounts of money and was happy to find and read through NwAvGuy's blog.  tl;dr:    If it has to be within $30 read his review of the Behringer UCA202. If you want to have a really good but portable device consider the JDS Labs C5D or the O2+ODAC. If you don't mind carrying a power "brick" adapter but want to use planar magnetic headphones get The Element. It's only a few CD jewel cases high and very nice.   (I finally bought The Element on Black Friday in addition to the C5D I settled for first. I have no affiliation with any of the companies mentioned here.)
I suggest you go for the Moto E (any generation, preferably the latest) or ship any Android one devices because these are the 'purest' Android devices in the 100$ - 120$ segment out there.  The biggest advantage is that they don't run bloatware means that you have a clutter-free experience with your Android device, and you stay updated all the time (Google ships updates to these devices faster to these devices compared to other OEMs).
You cannot install any worthwhile computing GPU in a HP Compaq Pro 6300.  Although the mainboard supports PCIe x16, the power supply is only 320 watts, far below what even lower-end computing cards require, and it uses custom connectors, making it impossible to upgrade.
I really can't think of a reason to get cold cathodes, except maybe they produce more light than some LEDs. LEDs will always use less power as long as you are comparing it against a cold cathode with the same amount of light emitted. LEDs will also last longer than cold cathodes and are less fragile since they aren't in glass tubes. LEDs usually come in strips, so it is bendable which means that you can bend it around your case to get adequate lighting. Cold cathodes also require a inverter that converts your DC power to AC power, which is another source of inefficiency and point of failure. For looks, LEDs will look better because they are flexible but cold cathodes will give you a much more retro look.
Upgrading the HDD to an SSD will be fine as long as the HDD is a SATA connection (which it is). You cannot place the HDD in the optical drive unless your manufacturer has a bracket for it (some of them do, most of them don't).
The Logitech G502 would be great for your purpose. It has multiple macro buttons and all the buttons are programmable through software. The mouse is ergonomic and is a great gaming mouse. It is also not very expensive for what it is.
In general the Samsung SII+ and Note 2+ series fit very closely to your criteria because:    All have removable batteries   almost exclusively a Samsung feature except the S6 and Note 5  All have a MicroSD card slot All have USB OTG support   this feature is not to be underestimated  All phones are very popular, can be rooted/have ROMs available and should work across all carriers. Refer to: xda-developers.com    As for the following:   Costs $100~150 The phone has 2GB or more of RAM     It really only leaves (in order):   Note 2 S3 (my own preference) SII   The Note 2 has enough RAM (2GB) and you'll probably get it for under $150. You should get the S3 easily under $150 and even though it has only 1GB, you've considered it above so on that basis I've added the SII which is also 1GB. The SII is nice to get comfortable modding with, because you can get one for less than ~$100 last time I checked, most likely cheaper now.    I've played with almost all the Samsung phones in the S and Note series and as it looks like you'll be using the phone on a day to day basis I'd go for the S3 myself because:   1GB is perfectly fine for normal use The processor is the same as the Note 2 and performance is arguably similar/better I prefer the S Pen with Samsung Apps It's better than the SII (faster and has better internal storage) It's not that much more expensive than the SII so is nearly as disposable   I thought these may be helpful    Accessible general guide to rooting: http://lifehacker.com/5789397/the-always-up-to-date-guide-to-rooting-any-android-phone  How to Root T-Mobile Galaxy S3 SGH-T999: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1735561
UleFone be touch 2 should meet your requirements.

I bought an AeroSkull HD from Jarre Technologies that already had this feature and I remember that they called it TrueWireless Stereo. It's a proprietary technology  developed by CSR, the company that makes most of the Bluetooth chips and who have previously acquired aptX.  Unfortunately this particular feature is not advertised through ingredient branding, contrary to the original plans for aptX. Finding more information about TrueWireless Stereo seems to be rather difficult. CSR has a separate website for aptX which I suspect to be closely related, but there is no information either, only categories for different products without filtering and sorting to display newest products first or to only show products with that particular feature. (Most of the products on the first page look old.)  Price comparison sites like geizhals.at also have no information about this feature, though this site usually is very well organized â€“ you just select features you want in a product and get the results.  The best I can find is the following video from CSR:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSPiAwwXwTA  I saw that some similar Stereo functionality was also advertised for newer portable speakers like the Sony SRS-X11. While the AreoSkull and some older speakers already have this feature I'd recommend to look closer at products released in 2015 and later.
Well, considering the fact that you need to charge other phones the phone must have a huge battery. The new Gionee Marathon M5 will definitely suit your needs with a humongous capacity of 6020mAh. The phone runs Android Lollipop out of the box and boasts an AMOLED display. It comes as a surprise that Gionee has managed to fit a huge battery relative to current standards in an 8.5 mm thick shell (consider it a bonus). It also has an OTG(On the go) cable for charging other devices. There is also another device manufacturer named Oukitel (Chinese) which made the Oukitel K10000. I do not recommend this because it has a relatively low performance and a bad display.
If you are thinking about Xiami Redmi Note 2 you have to know that:   It has removable battery  It uses MIUI, it is operating system based on Android but developed by Xiaomi Tech. It is important to check which kind of screen you will get Tianma or Oppo. Tianma screen is kind of yellow in comparition to other phones. XDA Developers thread about this problem. It is dual SIM and can use microSD card with both SIM cards. (no hybrid slot for second card)

If it is okay for you to root the phone with very few easy steps as possible then mi's range of phones are the ones you must be looking for. MI does provide warranty for rooted devices in fact, there is an option in the security app to allow root permissions and sorta stuff and it is priced fairly compared to the Fair phone.   ALL you have to do is download a file which Mi offers on its website after registering yourself. Follow the instructions and boot into the boot loader of the device and install the zip file you downloaded and reboot your device to the normal state to enjoy your rooted phone
A little bit of "life" intervened, and I ended up going with a solution from Synology, their DS215j. I confirmed that it supported SSDs before ordering both it and a set of SSDs.  The NAS and one SSD showed up first, so I plugged them all in so that I could start moving music and pictures over (with the hopes that Synology's software feature of expandable "hybrid" RAID would work correctly).  One minor hiccup I ran into was not knowing whether I needed Synology's "optional 2.5" Disk Holder Type C". I had ordered the NAS from Amazon (listed as their #1 North America online merchant), and didn't notice a Disk Holder as being part of the standard shipment, nor as a suggested add-on, so I (needlessly) purchased a "2.5 to 3.5 Inches Internal Hard Disk Drive Mounting Kit". Turns out that the mounting kit pushes the SSD too far away from the connector, so I made do with some packing plastic and the screws that I could line up.  The NAS came online on my LAN with no issue -- plugged directly into the upstream router -- and was easily discoverable with the "find.synology.com" web assistant. I set it up and was online with it quickly.  The DS215j features three fan speed modes: "Cool", "Quiet", and "Low-power". I'd have to refer to the manual, but with SSDs and the NAS sitting in the basement, I've had good luck with "Low-power" mode.  The Synology NAS is easy enough to use; the standard setup was enough to get me going, but there is an accessible CLI for when I want to tinker.  The reliability question will have to wait, but so far so good!  As far as expandability, the Synology Hybrid Raid has proven to go from "RAID-1 with 1 drive" to "RAID-1 with 2 drives", and promises to allow for expandable replacement drives (once the second SSD arrived, I shut the NAS down and installed it, similarly to the first). I haven't had to test the expandable-drive promise, but given the flexibility it has already shown, I suspect that it will be able to grow as I need it.  As far as transfer speeds go, I haven't done precise timing tests; I had a large amount of data to move, and only one "source" (the original laptop), so it was going to take as long as it was going to take. I have noticed that there is a slight pause in iTunes when requesting playback of a larger file (above 5 Mb) - it appears to me that iTunes wants to buffer enough of the file that it results in a noticeable delay.
You're going to need something custom-built.  A back-of-the-envelope calculation says that to read an iPhone screen at 8 meters, you need a lens with a 50mm-equivalent focal length of 1000mm.  Lenses that long are available for DSLRs and a few point-and-shoot cameras, but not for anything smaller.  Expect to spend between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on the quality of image you want.  Alternatively, if you've got contacts with one of the major intelligence agencies (CIA, MI6, FIS, etc.), you might see about borrowing some of their hardware.
I've posted another answer and pictures here but I'd recommend the crossover 289K. I got mine for ~350usd from an ebay seller called dream-seller though if you're us based there might be cheaper options to buy it from  Its 28" but meets most of the specifications. I've got no way to check for HDCP 2.2 support and I cannot confirm that it supports it. Information on support is, to put it mildly, as clear as mud.  Otherwise   FullHD or higher resolution: 4K60hz Above spec but its not a terribly pricy monitor  4 inputs in total: (4 HDMI or 3 HDMI + 1 DP) 3HDMI 2.0 and 1 DP port, all supporting 4K60. One 1080p VGA input for legacy gear    1 HDMI input must support HDCP 2.2: Unsure - there's no way to check. Nvidia reports it suggests HDCP but not what version. I'll be glad to run any reasonable check that can be run on a windows box. Their horribly designed website suggests it does support it.   switching between inputs should be "easy": Hit select, pick an input with the arrow buttons, hit select again. Really nice OSD, though button placement is behind the screen to save on bezel space. Nice large buttons  and I didn't have too many issues hitting the correct one. Heck it was easier than the side buttons on my old dell.  operation without remote control:  Optional remote - which I love to bits. I just hit source to switch sources. Very handy when caliberating the screen.
Bluetooth compared to 3.5mm CTIA TRRS  Basically if A2DP is transparent for you why would you replace it with a standard cable or even a proprietary one?  Another question named 3.5mm Analog Audio vs. Bluetooth Audio Quality has been perfectly answered on SuperUser.  Lightning cables as a DAC/Amp  While I'm not an Apple customer, I believe that Apple could bring a change to the market, however till now it looks as constructed as the rumors about an Apple smart TV and not like solution that Apple (or some other company with another connector) intends to promote actively.  The headphones mentioned are the Philips Fidelio M2L (based on the inexpensive Fidelio M1 series) and the AMP/DAC/DSP Apple Lightning cableÂ¹ for the Audeze EL-8 which has been offered with the closed back version in a titanium-colored variant for a few weeks.  The M2L looks like it has no replaceable cable, here is a comparison with the M1BTBL:    Integrating the DAC into the M2L cable (or similar products) and putting a 3.5mm plug on the other end would be possible and great for compatibilityÂ² but increase the price of DAC replacement cables (you probably get a new Fidelio M1 for the price) and generate questions from customers who have unfounded doubts about the 3.5mm plug.Â³  Proprietary connectors on the headphones themselves are accepted for products in higher price ranges and ensure compatibility with a variety of jacks on different devices, but mainstream product designs seem to be increasingly optimized for incompatibility and obsolescence.â´  Products that rely on only one connector type that isn't 3.5mm TRS/TRRS appear to be very short lived to me. You may find adapters, but that wouldn't be very practical.  The 3.5mm jacks and plugs are very durable and have been around for a long time, Microsoft even moved from 2.5mm to standard 3.5mm TRRS with their Xbox One and Sony has them on their PS4 too.  The missing headphone jack on the HTC Dream was probably the biggest anti-feature.  I'd rather recommend Bluetooth headphones with an optional 3.5mm analog jack, this way you get an integrated DAC and flexibility.  There's more to consider: Your next primary or personal communication device may not even have a Lightning-port or USB-port at all and connects completely wireless.  If the size of the 3.5mm plug actually becomes an issue for designing new ground breaking products then no physical connector would be the answer and we're almost there with smartwatches.  Conclusion and recommendation  When you encounter this or a similar topic check who promotes what.  Someone reviewing consumer hardware with a favor for a different connector for audio is not objective.  It's also inconsistent and appears to be overexcited when there was nothing to complain about 3.5mm plugs or Bluetooth with aptX in the ecosystem (Apple) before.  You may find that the Lightning or whatever version doesn't sound significantly better than the Bluetooth version or better at all. Save the money for a product in the next tier or for something completely different.  It doesn't matter if you prefer bass, mids or highs. If you prefer not carrying an additional device with you, that's fine too but has limitations.âµ  In any case get the most objective or reasonable playback device or sound source and the headphones with sound signatures you prefer for your music, then do your ABX listening tests. You will be confident with the decision you made and that should matter the most to you.     Now called Cipher.  I feel a little betrayed here, I shouldn't have searched for material on the web when writing this to find a fresh uploaded promotional video. I carry both the M1BTBL and M-100 around with only one cable and I get the most out of that setup. (Even more with an aptX dongle and a mobile DAC/Amp.) Analog connectors with better electrical characteristics have been available for a long time and implemented in professional equipment, but there is no need for these in the consumer market.  Also related: Is there sound quality loss in 6mm to 3.5mm TRS adapter? A coworker has the standard M1 and left them for a short while in the car during summer, the glued cushion seams on this model ripped and cannot be replaced.  Another thing is that Bluetooth headphones typically don't feature mechanisms to replace the battery, though a replaceable cover with a battery to twist or screw off doesn't seem to be impossible to implement in most designs and is still stylish for a fashion item. The EL-8 cable looks like a good idea to give you the optimal mobile experience on an iDevice, but they are still a heavy pair of cans for a walk around the city and if you have the habit to bang your head with the music or just sway to music while sitting down at home you're not getting the optimal performance when they bounce on your head creating pressure variations that interfere with the very sensitive diaphragms doing their work.
I've used 3 different flavours of Ethernet over power. Apparently it's seriously dependant on your household power line quality, and other devices.  Once I got it dialed in (and got slightly newer models than my homeplug AV 200 units), its fast and more importantly very reliable.   More expensive adaptors support newer 'faster' standards, and practically speaking you're likely to get about 1/3 the speed listed (so a homeplug AV 100 would do ~30Mbps, and so on). However, the newer standards are likely to have better noise rejection and as such better reliability.  A good middle ground would be HomePlug AV2 500 gear. AV2 200 is more sensitive to noise, and my washing machine would trip it off.  Things to look out for? Get passthrough devices since they filter noise from things plugged into it, and don't hog a socket. Some tuning and repositioning needs to be better. If you're running this in a living room, consider units with more than one ethernet socket.  While I don't use them now, I'd recommend TP-LINK's adaptors (I upgraded to a newer standard from another manufacturer - they're great but not widely available). They also have fairly intuitive, user friendly configuration software (though since all the chipsets are made by the same companies, I used it with my gear from other brands as well), which is handy if you want to set it up right.  It's great for backups (which is what I use it for) and getting wired connections to odd places.   I believe this is the two pack for the model I have now. Amazon UK seems to have a good range of them. Not too sure what's the best place for them in the UK, we share a plug type, but we have different retailers in Singapore.
CPU upgrade should raise your PC performance in CPU dependent apllications and games. HDD to SSD upgrade will significantly raise speed of opening/closing OS, running applications or copying files.   I would say that CPU upgrade will give bigger performance boost but HDD->SSD upgrade will reduce times of everyday operations like booting system, copying files, running applications. In my opinion SSD choice is better because difference will be more "visible" after changing HDD to SSD than i5 to i7.
From a pure numbers standpoint, the Hiro's 5dBi antenna beats the Panda's 2dBi antenna, and both beat the Netgear's tiny on-board antenna, so it's likely the Hiro will give you the best reception of the three.  You don't specify your budget, but it looks like about $20-ish.  If you're willing to go up to $30, the Alfa AWUS036NH has a powerful transmitter paired with a 5dBi antenna.  I've connected to access points with one from as much as half a mile away.  Assuming you're correct that your connection problems are due to low signal levels (and not high noise levels), it's a good choice.
It will not be possible to build a new gaming system for 300 RON.  You will need at least the following:   Motherboard RAM 8GB SSD 120GB + Graphics Card Power supply   I'm assuming you already have a monitor, keyboard and mouse and you will be using a free operating system, e.g. linux.  The cheapest SSD 120GB on dc-shop.ro is:  http://www.dc-shop.ro/ssd_uri/ssd-silicon-power-s60-120gb-sata3-2.5-inch-l/  This costs 199 RON  There is no way you can buy the folowing for 101 RON  Motherboard  RAM 8GB  Graphics Card  Power supply  This site is great when building rigs : pcpartpicker.com  edit  It's been suggested that maybe you are just looking for an SSD drive with a budget of 300 RON.  If that is the case then I would recommend spending a bit more and getting a 240GB SSD drive. 353 RON  http://www.dc-shop.ro/ssd_uri/ssd-patriot-blast-series-240gb-sata3-2.5-inch-l/    http://www.tweaktown.com/reviews/6918/patriot-blaze-240gb-ssd-review/index10.html  To me anything less than 200GB in an SSD is a false economoy.  If you absolutely cannot spend more than 300 RON.  http://www.dc-shop.ro/ssd_uri/ssd-corsair-force-series-ls-120gb-sata-3-2.5-inch-mlc-l/  Has the best read/ write speeds. 291 RON  However, when gaming the graphics card will largely determine the frame rate and not the SSD.
A SSD won't matter really for gaming performance, unless your RAM is becoming a limiting factor, or the game is divided into small sections that load in-game(like in Half-Life 2). Most popular today are the 850 Evo series from Samsung, but it seems they're not available. I'd go with Sean's suggestion, but not going for the cheapest 240GB drive, as it'll compromise on other things.  As an independent recommendation, I'd suggest this Sandisk 120GB one:  http://www.dc-shop.ro/ssd_uri/ssd-sandisk-pluus-120gb-sata3-2.5inch-l/  It's a mid-end drive, and Sandisk's drives are good. I have been using their Extreme series of flash drives for a while, and I'm not disappointed.
It appears that the Be Quiet 500W Straight Power 10 is a reasonably priced very quiet PSU - it is 10.7 dB loud on 50% load and 15.6 db at 100%, due to enormous, for PSU standards, 135 mm fan and very low max speed which is 1200 rpm1. It's currently $9 above the budget, but I think it's definitely worth it.
Many mobile Workstations using i5/i7 CPUs from DELL/HP/THINKPAD or other vendors can meet your requirements. Usually they provide 4 memory slots and of course, they support virtualisation features, but not suitable for server-like heavy computing works.  Almost all the i5/i7 CPU with 4 cores can support 32GB or more memory(like the early i7-4770hq\i7-2670QM), some 5/6th generation i5/i7 CPUs with 2 cores also support 32GB memory(like i5-6260U\i7-6500U). And you can use this site:http://ark.intel.com/#@Processors to check if a CPU can support 32GB memory.   Here are some recommended series: DELL precision M4800/4700/4600, THINKPAD w530/540 ,HP ZBOOK14/17/8470P/8570P. You can find some refurnished/second-hand ones(often with 8 memory) on ebay or amazon warehouse , usually it will cost you around 1000 USD/EURO including additional memories.
Take a consideration of HP gen8 microserver. It has four 3.5HDD bays,one 2.5 optical bay,and one microsd slot. Cheapest version with intel g1610T cpu,4 GB ecc memory(with out hdd) usually comes with around 220 EURO.  There is a easily used remote control tool called iLO pre-installed on the chip and you can do any configuration via ethernet instead of a display.  You can even install a ESXi on it and run several VMs including windows,linux,macos.

I recently bought a HP storage works x1400 from eBay for $50 including shipping. HP storage works x1400 is based on HP DL320 so if you search ebay you can look for DL320 G6   Specs   quad core cpu Takes 4 3.5 drives it came with 4 500gb disks   You can replace these with your own high capacity drives I think 2TB might be upper limit not sure if there is a way to override this I personally haven't tested whether this limit actually exist but have plans on verifying myself   It runs quiet compared to other racks and is also thin and light weight   I have installed server 2012 r2 but you can even install openfiler or Freenas  It has a sas port so you can join other similar hardware
Depends on your working/gaming style I suppose.   Maybe its cause I'm older but I tend to treasure vertical space over horizontal space, so ultrawide displays have never appealed to me. As a replacement for two monitors, or as part of a expansive stretched workspace 21:9 might work awesome. You can dock 2-4 windows and have plenty of space without the annoying bezel. Its a bit of a niche product and prices are adjusted upwards accordingly. That said, I'm not a fan of wide screens and this is a bit of a biased opinion  On the other hand 1440p is pretty well regarded - Until recently Jeff Atwood swore by 1440p/27 inch displays that were pretty reasonably priced, and your dell is smaller - which means better pixel pitch. Text is likely going to be sharper, backlight bleed is not that bad on quality displays (and seems to be more of a thing on IPS displays, and for gaming, its a more common aspect ratio. I've driven games at 1440p- with a gforce 660, so it would also be easy to run for gaming  Pixel pitch is a big deal. Basically the more pixels per square inch you have, the sharper a monitor is, and the easier it is to read text. I'm not too sure how much of an improvement it is between 1080p and 1440p, since I jumped straight to 2160p but it would likely be better to have higher resolutions  As for aspect ratio 16:9 is the standard for TVs. Its standard for most games, and PC gamer seems to think you need additional software to get things running.   So, between them? The Dell makes more sense. I'd probably also consider a few less traditional options before making my choice tho
OSVR is currently in the development kit stage. It's designed to be a low cost, easy to customize alternative   Price: ~300USD (350 â‚¬ for Germany)  Screen: The devkit uses a 1920x1080 single full HD screen - this might be upgradable in future  Seems to be available now. Has an SDK, works on Windows.  Its also open source hardware and software so you could customise it as needed.  Says in facebook that they ship to europe
There's quite a few similar ones but I used this as a secondary screen for a few years. It got somewhat roughly handled, but if you plan ahead and mount it correctly (and not try to work on it while its plugged in as I did) its a good monitor, which is remarkably good looking. No audio as far as I can tell.  DX tends to ship anywhere and shipping's part of the list price.  SO..  HDMI Port? Check. Also has composite or VGA if needed  Low price? Somewhere around 60 euros   Works with a RPI? Sure  No built in audio though, and its JUST over 10 inches.  There's a lower resolution 7 inch option as well I believe, which would be cheaper, but its something janky like 640x480.
The Fujitsu P Line P27T-7 UHD   Resolution: 3840x2160 (27") Inputs: 1x HDMI 2.0, 2x HDMI 1.4 (MHL), 1x DisplayPort 1.2 Input selection: input button at the front HDCP support according to a idealo.de review (version not known)     Warning: Some older versions with the same number seem to have different inputs.
For your computer, besides the extra RAM you need, I recommend an upgrade to your CPU cooler (something like the CoolerMaster V6 would be very nice) so you can overclock your current CPU. While the FX 4350 is only a two module CPU, it should handle most tasks well, and applications requiring more than 4 threads are rare. Only when you feel that your CPU is performing inadequately even with an overclock should you upgrade. If more cores will help, a AMD FX 8320 will perform just as well as an 8350 when lightly overclocked. If you need single threaded performance, you will need to go with Intel.  For Intel, since you can't find a K series CPU, there isn't much point getting a Z series chipset. A H97 or B85 would do just as well. Skylake doesn't really offer much in terms of increased performance. Unless you need the features of the newer platform, my advice would be to stick with Haswell.
Yes, the new drive can replace the existing drive. There are a couple things to note though:   The Crucial drive is SATA 3. Newegg says that the drive you have is SATA 2. If you assume that the controller can only support SATA 2, you won't get the full transfer speed the Crucial drive is capable of, but SATA is backward compatible and will work. It will fit. Both drives are the same standard physical size.   You can boot to Windows using this drive. Assuming that Windows is currently installed on the drive you are replacing, you'll need to either:   Completely reinstall the operating system once the new drive is installed. You'll want to ensure you are installing it on the new drive and not on the 1TB drive. Utilize HP's recovery options once the new drive is installed. Doing this may require that you create the recovery disks prior to removing the old drive.
After experimenting with a few experimental options - using a ledburg and a desklamp, I ended up building my own.  From my experiments, direct mounting would have been bad on my dell since the stand would have obscured the 'sweet spot' of lighting if I'd stuck it directly to the screen.     Its a DIY build so it may vary but I ended up getting a strip of 6500K white LEDs from my favourite chinese crapgadget vendor, chopping it up into ~27 LED strips, building a small wooden stand per monitor, and wireing it up to my power supply through a molex/floppy adapter. It turns on and off when my PC does (since it taps power from the PSU), is and is independent of the monitors.   They're ludiciously bright (which I love) though you could probably just use less LEDs. Since they're a strip, the backlight is fairly even outside the edges.     Mounting was an exercise in experimental interpretative carpentry, in my case. You could stick them directly, but I wanted the freedom to replace it in future if the cheap LEDs went bad, or I wanted to compare it side by side with a new option. This also ensures its roughly at the center of the back of each screen.
One of my earlier experiments used a set of LEDBURG lights from ikea. Its somewhat easier to mount, since it comes in rigid, interconnectable strips, but I didn't like the warm white for this application. It was instrumental in setting up what I use now though.
I recommend a HP micro server. You can see a similar question here.  As a micro server, it supports 24/7 work though it consumes more power than those NASs.  If you just need some private online storage, router with a high speed usb port + usb HDD/Flashdisk can meet your requirements.  One recommended router is ASUS AC56U,adding a usb HDD, it can be easily used as a private online storage.
Who's still developing non-smart TV's?   Almost all of them?  I believe your basic assumption is flawed. I'm assuming you're defining a "smart TV" as one that has installable/hackable software or at least some type of Internet connection. A quick search shows that there are still many, many TVs being developed and produced that have none of this; just a nice display and a tuner or video connection. They're relatively easy to spot because they tend to have a lower price point, or you can search for them directly:  Search: LCD TV -smart  I see non-smart TVs by Samsung, Sharp, Panasonic, Sanyo, Westinghouse, Philips&hellip; HDTV 720p-4K, HDMI inputs, sizes from 17 inches through 70+ inches. You can search for CRTs, LCDs, LEDs, plasma, etc.   There's still quite a selection. "Non-smart" TVs are readily available.
If you want a modern TV without all the perceived smart-TV risk, just buy any TV with the  features you want and disable the Internet and wireless settings.   Boom, instant non-smart TV.  I had a cutting-edge (for the time) 60" Sharp Aquos four-color 240fps 3D full HDTV for over a year before I turned the Internet on. I just had no use for it (at the time). I just wanted a nice TV with a great picture&hellip; like you are looking for here.  Any TV with with an advanced feature set will also have advanced configuration settings. Just turn off what you don't want and enjoy the rest.
Hmm so what you are looking for is something I had in mind as well. keep in mind mine was supposed to serve as a NAS and a Plex server so might be not exactly what you want. So here is my list:  MB: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157390 CPU: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117374 Case(any mini ITX rated case will do): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117374  PS: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817256097 Memory (8GB is more than enough): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148545&cm_re=DDR3--20-148-545--Product   any drive you think is good for you.  So u don't actually need a lot of processing power. The trick is to understand what you will be using most. Mysql usually only runs on 1 thread, same as SSH. I seriously doubt u will stress the Pentium CPU. if you need more power then you should consider some other alternative. (But seriously, unless you are going to serve content to 20 users at the same time, you should be fine)  Thats just my 2 cents.  The mother board does not have IPMI!  if you want to be able to control the board without a monitor or keyboard you will need IPMI (when SSH is offline. Ex: when you are in BIOS or something like that).  So this MB looks ok: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157466
I'd recommend the Logitech K750 Solar.    I've had this keyboard for over a year and it's perfect. I have zero complaints.  I'm very familiar with Apple's keyboards so the shift to this keyboard has been effortless. It's thin, and has flat keys. The layout is also designed for mass with the function keys having their appropriate icons.    Specs:   Solar Powered (I've had this almost year and it's still 100%) Flat keys Thin design Full-size keyboard Apple Layout / Design   The price is $59.99 USD, though you may be able to find it cheaper.    Thin:    Available colors:
In this price range I would choose:   CM Storm Devastator - LED Gaming Keyboard and Mouse Combo Bundle. It is available in Newegg shop in Blue/Red LED for $29.99 and in Green LED for $41.37.   But if you can find additional funds I would recommend other keyboard and mouse:   Keyboard: Gigabyte Force K7 which costs arond $50 Mouse: Roccat Lua which week ago I saw in Amazon for $20 but now it costs $35.89 (maybe it will be on sale again)   Both mouse and keyboard have better parameters than CM set and they are absolute minimum for gaming. If you are not interested in better precision and reacion times then take CM set.
well, assuming the fact that you want a good phone for development you might be interested in the moto g3 which has a very good battery, almost no bloat-ware and runs near stock android. The moto g3 also has  front facing speakers and a 5-inch screen which looks stunning even-though it has a 720p display (294ppi). The phone currently is running android 6.0 and might recieve update for another android version.
No, such a thing does not exist. However, you can do something quite similar, even though it's not quite a PC on a USB stick.  If I understand your question correctly, you want to use one computer (which may be very old and slow) for it's screen, keyboard, and mouse, and use another computer or device to do the actual processing.   As an example: I use an ancient Pentium 3 laptop as a frontend for a Raspberry Pi. All that's needed is an Ethernet cable, and I have a perfectly capable display, keyboard, and trackpad for my Pi.  To do this, you need a way to network your two computers (one is the one you want to use for the display, kayboard, and mouse, and the other is the one you want for the actual processing, in my case a Raspberry Pi, but it could also be a HDMI computer on a stick, as long as it has WiFi, USB or Ethernet, or even just a normal desktop or laptop.) In my case I used an Ethernet cable (if your devices don't have ethernet, you can use a USB to Ethernet adapter), but you could also use an ad-hoc WiFi network or even a USB to USB networking solution.  Hook up your two devices, make sure they can talk to each other, and then you can use remote desktop software or SSH to do pretty much what you want.   While it's not quite a computer on a USB stick, it's pretty close, with only a single cable.  Beware: the performance may not be great (With my PI, using it over VNC / Remote desktop is  slow, but usable)
Sounds a lot like the USB armoury which I found googling for a remarkably similar, older product whose name I still don't remember. The feature list suggests you could emulate a device for communications with the host/  NXP i.MX53 ARMÂ® Cortexâ„¢-A8 800Mhz, 512MB DDR3 RAM USB host powered (<500 mA) device with compact form factor (65 x 19 x 6 mm) ARMÂ® TrustZoneÂ®, secure boot + storage + RAM microSD card slot 5-pin breakout header with GPIOs and UART customizable LED, including secure mode detection excellent native support (Android, Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux) USB device emulation (CDC Ethernet, mass storage, HID, etc.) Open Hardware & Software   That said, for that price, you could probably get a cheap HDMI display for about half the price instead
I would reccomend buying a laptop from digital storm. You can customize your laptop to your likings and price range. Most of the laptops they have are themed towards gaming but they can be used to run vms and all that stuff. You can customize your computer so if you do not want a graphics card you do not have to have a graphics card. Most of there laptops support 32gb of ram and you can have several different options for CPUs so you can get one that fits your performance and price needs. Everything also comes pre installed. I believe this should meet all of your requirements. Digital storm does only have a one year warranty but some of the parts may have a longer warranty and digital storm will replace the parts within 3 years of the Purchase.
I am currently using the Logitech G100s. It is a cheap, no frills mouse. It has a clicky scroll wheel, and a button to choose the DPI. It has no lighting, no macros, and I find it to be suitably comfortable. The software used to select where your DPI choices are for the button to cycle through supports 1-5 different DPIs between 250 and 2500.  It is slightly more than your budget, however I feel it is a very solid offering and well worth the extra money at about $15-25 depending on where you purchase it.
Firstly, I would suggest raising budget if you want to play games in high graphics settings because desktop within 500 USD budget will not run new games like Fallout 4 in full details.  500 USD - PC:   Motherboard: 60 USD Gigabyte GA-H81M-HD3 CPU: 115 USD Intel Core i3-4170 GPU: 160 USD Gigabyte GTX 950 OC RAM: 35 USD Crucial Ballistix Sport 8GB (2 x 4GB) HDD: 48 USD Seagate Barracuda 1TB PSU: 40 USD EVGA 100-W1-500-KR 500W CASE: 35 USD RAIJINTEK ARCADIA   This set will cost 493 USD but if you want to play new games in full details I would recommend to save additional cash for GTX 970 (~300 USD) and Intel Core i5 (for example "4690" - 225 USD).
Tried to get the best build I could under the budget. Its skylake/pentium based and quite certainly reflects some of my build biases. Its designed to be a simple machine with relatively few compromises and the option to upgrade as funds are available. @ivaan's machine is probably another useful starting point though I went for slightly more modern, smaller parts. I've linked the PC parts picker list so you can play around  PCPartPicker part list: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/Yy3XjX  Price breakdown by merchant: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/Yy3XjX/by_merchant/  CPU: Intel Pentium G4400 3.3GHz Dual-Core Processor  ($59.99 @ SuperBiiz)  Motherboard: ASRock H170M-ITX/DL Mini ITX LGA1151 Motherboard  ($92.98 @ Newegg)  Memory: G.Skill Ripjaws V Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-2400 Memory  ($74.88 @ OutletPC)  Storage: Hitachi Deskstar 7K2000 2TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive  ($62.00 @ Amazon)  Video Card: Asus GeForce GTX 950 2GB Video Card  ($139.99 @ Micro Center)  Case: Cooler Master Elite 110 Mini ITX Tower Case  ($38.98 @ Newegg)  Power Supply: *Cooler Master Elite Power 400W ATX Power Supply  ($29.99 @ Directron)  Total: $498.81 Prices include shipping, taxes, and discounts when available   This is a starting point. Its useful to understand why I picked certain parts, and what you can replace them with  So... compromises - I went for the lowest end pentium I could, for low cost and power efficiency. A proper core i3 or i5 would be nice. I went with skylake since there's a few useful features   I went for 16gb of ram, personal bias, and you could save a few dollars going for less, but this maxes out the ram. Depends on your needs but 2x4 would work. This is DDR4 ram, rather than DDR3  Asrock's reasonably solid these days, and a mini itx motherboard/case is about as small as you can go and still game. This one's wierd and dosen't support m.2 but I was trying to minmax for cost+trustybrandedness.  Went for a mini itx compatable small video card - maybe a 960 or a r9 nano would be a step up.  The cooler master Elite 110 is a nice small case that takes a full size PSU. I find small form factor PSUs limiting.  The PSU is a compromise for cost. I'd much rather a modular PSU in a mini ITX build .  I'd use stock cooling here - its good enough, small, and I have not much of a budget to design off of.   HGST is basically the most reliable consumer hard drives you can buy. Its not that much more, and I trust them. I guess you could swap this for a SSD or a smaller drive.
I'd say it's not worth spending more money to get more performance out of this or any other 7.1 headset. Just use it in stereo mode if you have no 7.1 source.  Operating systems and applications like games or media players are responsible for handling sound: selecting the appropriate output path and channel profiles, applying dynamic range compression where necessary and so forth. This is particularly true for games where the soundscape is rendered by the game engine and it doesn't get more accurate with 2 speakers or headphones than the game engine knowing that it should render a stereo signal. A multichannel downmix by an unknown element in the chain doesn't improve the result it's just a dishonest, technophobe marketing myth and number game that is still around.    Stereo (1), generated Downmix (2) and 5.1 Mix (3-8) of Paschendale from Iron Maiden (Sources: 24-Bit FLAC, DVD-A)  If you need a visual example, download Audacity or any other audio editor, load a multitrack audio track from a movie or audio recording and mix it down to stereo. Many people pretend to care much about clean audio. Does the downmix with information from all channels look cleaner or more detailed to you? No, it doesn't! Good games are able to mix all the information into a high quality stereo signal. With the rise of VR binaural audio will get more important and virtual 7.1 mixes will hamper your immersion. Please let game engines do their work without interference, the game designers who put them together should know better how to treat audio that they or their customers create.  I could suggest to you to get a cheap 7.1 USB soundcard from China, but that's worse than your built-in sound solution. A multichannel audio production interface can actually deliver good quality but is at least three times out of your budget, not very portable and the Windows drivers don't support running the channels as a 7.1 configuration for gaming while the hardware is capable of doing so. I'd rather recommend an O2+ODAC or a similar product and reference headphones if you're already willing to spend +150 USD.  Here is a review from a Razer fan who isn't very impressed with this headset either. I found this video while looking for a picture of the connectors.
Your operating system such as Windows or Mac OS X should be able to remap the input of the keyboard to Dvorak, Colmak, or other national language layouts. You should not need any support for this from the keyboard hardware.  By the way, transitioning to a standing desk may help with your back and slumping. Working with a good Pilates trainer helped me immensely.  Kinesis  As for ergonomic keyboards, consider various products from Kinesis. My favorite is the Freestyle2.

I don't think you need a better motherboard. It doesn't affect performance when not overclocked. Even if the best PCIe slot is only 8x it's good enough for the GTX 970.  As of RAM I would personally add another 8 GB. I would go with the same DIMMs, but if you need new ones I recommend the Crucial Ballistics series. The DIMMs are cheap and have good performance and I never had mine fail before. With the extra RAM it can help get a smoother timeline for 1080P editing and photoshopping. As for gaming power 8GB should be enough.  Definitely go for an SSD as it's a cheap way to almost always get a performance gain. I would personally go with an Samsung or Intel SSD. As for Samsung I can recommend the 850 EVO and Pro, and as for Intel, a 730 series SSD should be good. I would get 2 SSDs in my opinion though, or one large one as I would store my unedited video and primary games on it.  By the way, just a handy tip. If you are serious about the video and photo editing it's handy to get a 10 bit screen with high color accuracy.
For development it is a good idea to get a high-end phone. The nexus 5x is a high-end phone for a great price. It has a front facing speaker, 5.2 inch display with a 1920x1080 resolution. The CPU is a Snapdragon 808 and has 2GB of RAM. The phone is running android 6.0 and will continue to get updates for the next 2 years. A good reason to get a nexus for development is because of a "skinless (stock android UI)" android meaning less power is used to just have the phone turned on. Originally the nexus line was created for developers. The phone is also in your price range at 349 USD on Amazon.
If you upgrade to the R9 Nano, Fury X, or 980, you will see a definite increase in performance over your GTX 970. However, because you do not play games at 4k and the difference sits between 12-25%, I would wait on either the new NVidia or AMD cards to come out later this ear, and buy those.  After the recent price drop, the r9 nano sits at the same price as the GTX 980 ($500 U.S.) and is more powerful, so if you really do want to upgrade, buy the Nano at that price point.  Upgrading further, and you'll see that the 980ti is a better deal than the Fury X at it's price point of $650 U.S, and performs about 10-15% better in most games as well.  Your upgrade also should depend on the kind of work or games you play. If, for example, you do video editing on your computer, I think the upgrade might be a good idea. But if you're just upset with having to tune your settings to high instead of ultra to play at 60fps... I would wait.  Keep in mind that in some games, especially games that use NVidia Gameworks like the Witcher 3, the 970 and 980 will perform better than the r9 nano, but in others, such at Grand Theft Auto 5, the opposite is true.  All in all, I would just choose to wait until the new cards come out before upgrading, unless your job requires something more powerful or you have tons of cash lying around.  Just a side note, two 970's in SLI perform very similar to a 980ti, and you will probably save money going this route as well, but doing this will reduce your computer's upgrade ability, and some games and programs do not support SLI, leaving you with the power of only a single 970.
The reason for $30 extra for ITX is because it is smaller physically. You are paying for higher precision engineering (same stuff needs to fit into a smaller square) also explains less PCI and RAM ports. The ITX board will also in theory use a bit less power.  The ITX board also has a TPM header the other one doesnt.  More info here:  https://superuser.com/questions/810276/why-very-few-modern-motherboards-are-equipped-with-tpm  Yes the G3460 is going to be better for you if you use the Saphire card.
If you're OK with the noise and the potentially large power bill, you could always go for an off-lease rack-mount server.  For example, I currently own two high-grade but outdated (from the enterprise perspective) servers. One is an Apple Xserve from 2008, which I upgraded to dual quad-core 3GHz Xeon CPUs, 32GB of RAM and 6TB of storage - total cost including server and upgrades was $450. The second is a Dell PowerEdge R900 that I got for $350 - a deal I couldn't pass up - which came with quad quad-core Xeons (16 cores), 128 Gigabytes of RAM, and eight 146GB 15K SAS disks. While I got a good deal on this one, servers of this level of power do appear on eBay in the $400-550 range often.  The major issues you'll have with rack mount servers are noise and power consumption. The Xserve is the server I keep running all the time - its noise output is tolerable especially if it's in another room, and its power consumption is roughly the same as a mid-range desktop (250 watts idle, 375 watts under full 8-core load). The PowerEdge unfortunately is a bit too noisy, and even worse, its power consumption would put a hefty premium on my power bill (760 watts idle, 1000 watts under full 16-core load.) It only comes on when I actually plan to use its impressive power. :-)  There are of course other options out there. Dell has smaller 1U servers (PowerEdge 1950 line for example) which are even cheaper, in the sub-$200 range. If you're looking for a traditional desktop formfactor, Dell Precision workstations from 2009-2010 tend to go for decent prices and include many of the same advantages of the PowerEdge servers - ECC RAM, SAS disk support, high maximum RAM, etc. If you're willing to splurge, I've seen 12-core 64GB RAM machines with SAS drives going for $600-700. Of course, I'm not specifically plugging Dell here - HP, IBM, et al all have similar hardware going for roughly equivalent prices.   The upshot is that if you're serious about a home virtualization lab solution, older server gear is an awesome way to get into it without spending a huge amount of money. Hardware of this vintage is well past its prime in the enterprise and datacenter market, but it's just right for home users who want some powerful hardware for cheap. You of course forfeit modern things like ultra-low CPU power consumption and newer instruction sets (AES-NI etc), but again, for the cost, can't go wrong.  As for virtualization software - My Xserve is currently running VMware ESXi. Apple stopped supporting this machine years ago, but it runs ESXi on the bare metal - and does so beautifully. I have four VMs running constantly, with no appreciable speed issues. I haven't looked into Xen yet, but I will say that one of the biggest drawbacks to the free ESXi server is that VMware does not give you access to vCenter Server, their management engine, for free - thus you miss out on some of the advanced features of ESXi as you are stuck with the older, less capable vSphere Client.
You might be interested in the APU boards from PC-Engines. I'm using one for my home-spun router. You get 3 Gig-E interfaces, a dual-core AMD CPU that appears to support virtualization, 2 or 4 GB of RAM, and SD card/mSATA/USB boot capability. You use a serial port to access the system console, and there's no multimedia to speak of.  http://www.pcengines.ch/apu1d4.htm  Here in the US I ordered my board from Mini-Box. The 4GB model is $169.   http://www.mini-box.com/ALIX-APU-1D4-AMD-G-Series-T40E?sc=8&category=1361  Mini-box also carries enclosures and the like to go with it. It uses a standard 12V barrel plug power supply - the same kind that comes with many routers, external hard drives, etc. You may even have one lying around. (I did.) For the serial console, you need a null modem cable and maybe a USB-to-serial adapter depending on what else you have lying around. Putty works great as a serial console app.  The AMD CPU has performance roughly comparable to Intel's "Bay Trail" Atom series. It's fully x86-64 compatible and runs Linux well.
There are zero products of your specification. I suggest that you purchase multiple extension cables and group them together and simply use them. I dont think you will ever reach out to the rear end of your computer to check out the plugged in cable and plug it out. You can tape those cables together
88-key MIDI keyboards for under $50 are a very rare find. Most decently priced ones only have ~50 keys maximum. Based on your budget, I can only recommend the M-Audio Keystation 49ES Black (~$65 USD).  Specifications:   49 full-size keys (velocity-sensitive) USB connection for playing virtual instruments and controlling DAWs (also for power) Pitch bend, modulation, and octave shift Light-weight Compatible with iOS for mobile composing   The big downfall with this keyboard though, and one that 99% of $70 MIDI keyboards have, is no weighted keys. To me, weighted keys make or break a keyboard because they are what truly provide the real piano experience. But if your friend is okay without this, then I fully recommend this product.
I think you are probably using the wrong terms here.  You seem to want basically a USB extension, cables, but with the ends that look nice.  What you may be looking for would be something like a USB patch panel.  These are mostly used for rankmount servers.  I haven't really seen anything targeted at the desktop market.  I don't have an particular experience with any of these vendors or models but a google search for 'USB patch panel' gave me these hits, which may get you pointed in the direction you are trying to go.   http://www.usbpatchpanel.com/ http://www.l-com.com/patch-panel-server-rack-19-usb-patch-panels-equipped-with-16-or-32-usb-a-b-couplers   You might also be looking for something called a USB bulkhead adapter.  These are sold as components to be put behind walk plates for high end media center type setups.  Where you would get a fairly standard wallbox of some sort and matching wall plates, then you can have all the wiring for your media center run inside the wall.  You may find adapters that would work, and then you could easily mount them in a standard electronics project box of some type.
Obviously you will have additional USB 2.0 headers on your motherboard, so I'll assume you need USB 3.0 ports. A cable that is an extension and comes from the back to front is not that elegant, it'll just add clutter.  Instead, you could get a panel that plugs to your front port optical drive bay:  4-port front panel  and a PCI-Express 3.0 card:    pci-express card    You'll have a total of six ports(two on the back and four on the front).  USB works as a tree-type structure so even if you have twenty ports, all bandwidth gets split to the same bus, limiting you to 5Gbps(625MB/s).  You can keep the ports you don't use open - it doesn't really affect speed if you don't use a port.
Edit: After understanding that the mSATA port will block the HDD drive bay I would suggest a Dual mSATA HDD adapter. Feedback is appreciated from anyone who is actively using such a setup as a boot drive on any OS.  Edit 2016-04-17: I hoped that Skylake equipped business laptops (HP, Lenovo, Dellâ€¦) would offer plenty of M.2 slots for SATA or NVMe storage, but the mobile chipsets don't offer as many PCIe lanes as the main or performance class desktop versions, which made some manufacturers come up with unexpected designs and decisions against a 2nd storage port or slot. Another example: Lenovo removed the small M.2 slot from the previous generation (T550) in favor of a combined 2.5 inch port where you can either install a SATA drive or a U.2 NVMe drive.       This is explained just a few pages below (p. 39) in the manual, it's an mSATA port. mSATA to SATA adapters exist, but are not suited for use in laptops. mSATA is replaced by NVMe in newer product generations, which achieves higher speeds by avoiding the SATA layer.  Here is list of recent mSATA SSDs for Europe/UK with capacities starting from 120 GB. I currently have a Samsung 840 EVO 120 GB which works fine so far, but there may be options that suit your needs better. Once you nailed down the features you want, look if the products are available in your country and for which price.  Guessing by your name you probably want to use the German version of the site for Austria and Germany.  Edit: the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF9gqAtM2U4 shows the installation of a second SSD in this model showing that it is possible.
Your price criteria is quite demanding (what you're looking for tends to be 1800+ Euro), but the short quick answer would be http://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/notebooks/defianceII-15/    Specs: 6th Gen Intel i7 Quad Core 8 Thread 6700HQ, has Vt-x and VT-d GeForce GTX 965M 2GB Graphics Card 32GB (4x8GB) 2133MHz DDR4 Memory installed-supports 64GB 3 year standard warranty    15.6" Matte Full HD IPS Backlit Keyboard (very very nice) 4 x USB 3.0 HDMI Output Connection & Mini Display Port Intel AC8260 (867Mbps) M.2 Wireless and Bluetooth Fingerprint Scanner    with a 500GB HDD (36 Euro) and Windows 10 (106 Euro) and delivery to EU (26 Euro-they do deliver elsewhere) comes to a total of 1334 Euro. Using their configurator you could remove Windows 10 for a Linux distro and replace the HDD with a 240GB SSD for 1284 Euro. If you need Windows you could install that later as a host OS or a VM. At the same time It's a very good graphics card and to utilize it fully with Direct X (to play some games too), maybe buy a standalone Windows license. As opposed to an OEM Windows license, which only allows you to use Windows on that machine (hard install or VM), you can easily move Windows to any another machine (physical or VM). Highly recommended to buy the HDD caddy too.     If you know you need 32GB this is the system I would recommend, as it exceeds both your required (2133 MHz DDR4 RAM, I assume you would have been happy with 1600MHz DDR3L) and not required (gaming graphics) specs. It'll easily destroy any common VM setup. Should handle any personal cloud computing stuff, obviously depends on the stuff. I'd leave server stuff to servers, again depending on end use, a small server shouldn't be too much of a problem.     Another (possibly cheaper) Option: You would want an i7 with virtualization support i.e VT-x (either 5th or 6th Gen) but are you sure you really need 32GB? You could get a dual core, four threaded i7 machine with 8-16GB with at least 2 RAM slots and pretty good graphics for 700-1000 Euro. 16GB is a lot of memory for running VMs. For example you could buy a 16GB machine easily for under 1000 Euro and try it. If you actually do need more RAM you could upgrade and you wouldn't necessarily be limited by 2 RAM slots (4 slots is obviously preferable). SODIMM RAM on laptops is usually limited to 8GB due to specification, however a clever company called Intelligent Memory has managed to stack a massive 16GB DDR3 on a single stick! So even with only 2 RAM slots you can reach 32GB.You can get them at amazon.de all you need is any 5th (Intelligent Memory) or 6th (PACCOM) Intel CPU, which you'll already have.
You want a GPU, not a CPU for gaming. Is there a reason you need to buy a new CPU? If not, spend that $200-$250 on a GPU instead.  You want something like this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150761  Instead of dealing with piss-poor low graphics, you'll be able to turn up most settings to maximum for many games.  Intel Integrated Graphics are suitable for desktop environments (very low graphics processing requirements) or video rendering (for software like OpenBroadcaster.)
Unfortunately, there are very few current 3.5" Android phones on the market in 2016.  Manufacturers are trying to own the market by making phones with larger screen size(>5.0") and are caring less about the compactness of the phone. It is quite difficult to find phones with a smaller display right now. Right now there are no new stock Android phones (the closest thing you can get are Nexus devices running the now-default Google apps or installing a custom ROM on some phones), but there are few other options if you are willing to compromise.  1: The Moto G Generation 1  It is compact and small at 4.7in and has a brilliant display. It is very comfortable to hold and single-handed operation is a zing. The best part is that it runs stock Android out of the box and can be upgraded to Android 5.1.1 officially. There are unofficial ROMs that will upgrade it to Android 6 Marshmallow too if you choose to use them.  Sacrifice: I'd say it's the perfect bang for the buck. The battery is average; it's not great nor is it bad.  2: The J series by Samsung  I'd recommend the J2 as it is the smallest of the J series at 4.7in with reasonable specs and an sAMOLED (Super AMOLED) display.  Sacrifice: It is clearly not an iPhone killer and runs Touch Wiz which is, according to my experience, unrefined and hogs a lot of RAM.  If you're willing to get a phone that isn't running Android, then I'd suggest you go for the new iPhone 6S. If you still want to have an Android phone, by sacrificing compactness you could go for the Moto Turbo (1, 2, or the new Z variant) or the Samsung flagships the Galaxy S7 and The Galaxy Note 5 (they can be flashed to stock Android or use custom launchers) which all have much higher specs and better performance than my other reccomendations.
The Pi Zero makes this easy and cheap. Set up the Pi and follow this tutorial: https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget/ethernet-gadget. I found that ssh is a good way to connect to the pi to perform these instructions.   When you are done, plug a micro usb cable into the USB data port on the pi and plug the other end into your computer. You should be able to use ssh pi@raspberrypi.local to connect to the pi without a wifi dongle.
Dell recently came out with the Latitude E7270 series which seems ideal.     Small and lightweight, 14" or smaller, no more than 2224 grams   12,5" display, starts at 1260 grams.     Linux support (I don't mind if it comes with Windows but every hardware component should work well under Linux too.)   They come with Windows 7/10 but we have good experience running Linux on former dell Latitude models, so it's probably fine. (We have some issues with the Dell E-Port Replicators, kernel 4.5.3 freezes after docking while the notebook is sleeping.)     32GB RAM support   They have 6th generation Intel Core processor which supports 32 GB of memory. The notebook has two memory slots and 16 GB modules are available but Dell says that it supports only 16 GB memory (2x8GB).  Anyway, my E7270 (as well as my colleague's E7470) runs well with 32 GB memory. It has two 16 GB Kingston KCP421SD8/16 modules.     Can handle three external displays (Currently I have three displays, all of them has DVI input and VGA too, but I'd prefer the digital one. Using DisplayPort->DVI and/or HDMI->DVI conversion cables are also fine for me.)   6th generation Intel Core CPUs also support that and our Dell docking stations have three display outputs.     Faster than my current Intel Core i5-3230M CPU @ 2.60GHz   It can come with Intel Core i7-6600U which seems faster.     Matte display   Anti Glare LCD seems fine.     Compatible with our Dell E-Port Replicators   It's compatible. The packaged Dell Docking Spacer for E7x40 is also handy.     Budget: ~$2500   Price on dell.com is between $1000-$2000.
I did some research and found that most power banks (and laptop batteries) use 18650 Li-Ion batteries (cells).  So finally I bought a 18650 battery case (search for "18650 power bank case") which I'm using with a 18650 cell from a disassembled old laptop battery. Currently this one:    Product link and image source: 2600mAh 5V 1A USB Power Bank Case Charger DIY Box For iPhone     Small enough to mount on a bicycle helmet   Its shape fits well to bicycle helmets   It's not perfect, but it seems to be the best option currently. Mine weights 67 grams (including battery).      Possible/easy to mount on a helmet   With self-adhesive velcro it works fine.     At least 1000mAh capacity   18650 batteries usually have 2600+mAh capacity.     No need to power on, always on (I don't want two handle two power buttons, the one on the camera is enough)   I have not tested it thoughtfully but mine does not have any power button and seems fine.     Easy to mount/unmount (unmount for shorter rides, or using more than one for longer rides)   Velcro solves that.
It is hard to find case which meets all your requirements in this budget but I have two recommendations under $70:   Corsair Carbide Series SPEC-03 - $70 on newegg.com. It is black with red lighted fan in front panel and meets all your requirements without USB type C support. This case has quite good cable managment and good airflow. Thermaltake Commander G41 - $65 + shipping on newegg.com. It also meets all your requirements without USB type C support. It has nice HDD and 5.25 mounting system and good amount of space for cable managment.
The answer to my own question is Silverstone RVZ01 with only 10.5 cm height. http://www.silverstonetek.com/raven/products/index.php?model=RVZ01  They include a custom 90 degree riser inside the case, which should fit most GPUs.
The best available CPU at ~70$ U.S. is the AMD Athlon X4 860K. It is an FM2+ socket Kaveri chip with for compute cores. It is clocked at 3.7 Gigahertz stock, though generally has very good overclocking potential, if interested, and also happens to be the CPU that powers my system.  Pretty much any Intel CPU beats it out in single core performance at stock, but when overclocked, it approaches i3 performance per core and has an extra 2 cores to work with.   The AMD FX-6300 is also another chip you might want to look into. It has 6 cores, each slightly inferior to the X4 860K's. However, it costs $90 and is on a dying CPU socket, the AM3+, which will be totally replaced by Zen later this year.  If you want to wait for the new Zen AMD CPUs to come out (AM4 socket), that is a good idea too, as they are supposed to actually compete with Intel i5 and i7 processors.
I wouldn't recommend going for a 24 in 4k as it isn't recommended for the eye.  Check out the Dell P2415Q if you don't change your mind and go for a 24 in monitor. It is priced at around 425 dollars for which you can get good TV.
In my opinion Xiami RedMi 2 Pro is much better choice than SGS4. Below I present pros for both phones:  Xiami RedMi 2 Pro   it's new it has LTE it has DualSIM it uses MIUI OS which has regular updates   SGS4   better screen (AMOLED 1920x1080) better camera it's cheaper     CPU and GPU are similar in this models maybe a little better in SGS4. The biggest advantage of Samsung phone is AMOLED Full HD screen but my choice would be Xiami RedMi 2 Pro because it has regularly updated OS (MIUI), LTE, DualSIM and it is brand new phone.
For $100, you're not going to get a new card.  New hardware RAID cards typically run several hundred dollars.  What you can get is an old server-class RAID card pulled from a retired system.  I recommend the Areca ARC-1120 8-port card.  It's a universal PCI/PCI-X card, so it can fit in almost any PCI or PCI-X slot (the exception being those few PCI mainboards with components blocking the area occupied by the PCI-X part of the connector).  It supports RAID 5 (as well as a variety of other RAID levels), supports up to 8 SATA hard drives, doesn't require any drivers under Linux for basic operations but has them (as well as management software) for advanced functionality, and you can usually find one on Ebay for under $100.  Two things to watch out for when buying off Ebay: people sometimes mislabel the ARC-1120ML (two SAS multilane connectors rather than eight SATA connectors) or the ARC-1110 (four SATA connectors) as the ARC-1120.  I can also strongly dis-recommend the 3Ware 9500S-8.  On paper, it looks similar to the ARC-1120, but appears to be optimized for benchmarking, and performs quite poorly with small-random-write workloads.
To measure the signal integrity all you need is an oscilloscope. Your requirements aren't in the (old) I2C specifications, but need to be found in the data sheets for your particular devices connected to the bus.  For sniffing and analyzing the bus I'd recommend a Saleae Logic. (http://www.saleae.com). Later versions can perform analog measurements, too. All measurements can be automated (and networked) and they have a nice API available to customize your specific measurement.  Edit to elaborate on details:  You will need to consider what you need, and when you need it.  The list of things you want to do not usually fit in one test.  I usually break down to these stages:  Circuit design  This is where you read the data sheet for the I2C slave devices. They each specify the min/max raise/fall timing for both the clock and data signal (usually identical). You usually are able to ensure correct timing by using standard value pull-up resistors. Make sure to provide test pads on both SDA and SCL lines.   Circuit verification  When you have your first PCB back from manufacturing it's time to verify that the design parameters are correct. With a powered circuit, measure the short-to-ground current of both the signal lines and ensure it fits with your calculated design values. Then use hardware bring up software to make the I2C host generate data trafic and verify with an oscilloscope (or other means) that your design parameters are meet. You may have some capacity from the PCB design that screws up your design parameters. In bad cases you may even have to redo the board layout to fix it.   System bring up  This is where you start implementing drivers for each of the slave devices. Therefore an I2C analyser can be a very handy thing.  This is usually the time you discover cross-talk related problems, to which you either devise a time-sliced workaround or -more correctly- go back to the design to fix it.   Production testing  At this point you know you have a working design and a working system. The components are tested by the manufacturer so we can assume they are working. Usual problems associated to manufacturing are component miss-placement, bad soldering and shorts. You can verify all this with two simple measurements on the test points: Voltage at test-point and the short-to-ground current from the test-point.   With this I hope you have a better understanding of what your requirements in reality are.
When given the choice between onboard, Xonar U5Â¹ and Prodigy CubeÂ² under $100 one would probably go for the highest quality product available. A few years ago I would have chosen the Prodigy Cube, because it has designer components and an impressive professional looking product page. I bit later I would have gone with professional recording interfaces, but unless you can actually evaluate the objective audio performance of a device, a discussion will be more subjective based on taste and preference.   Try onboard first. You are already willing to pay for it and it can be your fallback if the external soundcard drops out. I recommended to read a review about the Behringer UCA202 (~$30) in: External USB audiocard with 3.5 or 6.35 jack output. I feel a bit ashamed for dropping the name in every second answer of mine, but that is as much as I know or have experience with.      Asus support staff was unable to answer a question about demanding low impedance headphones regarding their high-end soundcards. I have little to no confidence recommending their products if "supports 600â„¦" is what they can say about it. I was interested in buying a Dr.DAC from Audiotrak until I read that the Alps potentiometer usually crackles and that this can be avoided in high quality designs.
I'd recommend the Matias Laptop Pro.  Subjectively, the Quiet Click switches are possibly my favorite quiet switch.    Let's compare with your requirements:     Must play nice with my 2012 MacBook Pro   Mine works very nicely with my 2009 MacBook Pro and my iPhone.     Must not slide around too easily, that's my pet peeve with keyboards   Haven't found it to be a problem.     Must be affordable (ideally < $200, but much less would be better)   Cost is $170+shipping from Matias, currently $160 and free shipping with Prime on Amazon.     Format should be US/QWERTY. Bonus points if I can rip the keycaps off and turn it onto Dvorak, if I ever get the ambition up to do so.   This board is US/QWERTY.  You may want to order separate F & J keys if you don't want the homing bumps to be in the wrong spots.  As a bonus, the stock caps for this board also list the characters you can type using option+key and option+shift+key.  Ideally:     Bluetooth, I don't have very many spare USB ports   This one is 100% bluetooth.     Have an option to have an OS X-style 'command' key symbol instead of the nasty Windows key symbol.   Also has the modifiers in the proper OS X order and says "option" instead of "alt".     Not sound like hail hitting a tin roof, that makes me cringe when I type.   It's not as quiet as my TypeHeaven, but not any louder than the MX Clear switches of the CODE keyboard.  Decidedly not a "superclicker".  Not needed:     Numeric pad: I hate those things and never use them anyway   None to worry about here.     Portability: I don't have any issues using my MacBook keyboard when travelling.   You're getting that anyway.
If you have large pockets (not necessarily cargo pants size), the Poker ][ is a very nice pocket-size board.  Mine has an aftermarket aluminum case, which means it's a very tight fit in my pants.    Vortex has since discontinued the Poker ][ in favor of the Pok3r, which comes with a stock aluminium case and has a different default fn-layer mapping.  Other 60% keyboards should be about the same size as the Poker series.  If you're looking for something even smaller and are willing to live with using the numbers from a function layer, the JD 40 (since discontinued, or at least no longer listed on the manufacturer's website, https://www.crtralt.io) was a good bet.  Assuming you do not mind both a the 40% size and an ortholinear layout, the Planck is your way to go.  Its manufacturer also makes parts for the Atomic, which is an ortholinear 60% keyboard that you get to assemble yourself.  Finally, the TypeMatrix 2030 is deeper and maybe a bit wider than the other options, but is easily the thinnest of the bunch.  It's a 60% ortholinear keyboard with scissor switches (the others all use traditional mechanical switches).  It won't fit into any pockets (unless you count the font pocket of a hoodie sweatshirt, but it will easily fit into a briefcase, backpack, or on top of a stack of books.
The Asus Xonar D2X appears to fulfil your requirements.  Here are two links regarding Linux support:  http://www.linux-hardware-guide.com/2014-08-02-asus-xonar-d2x-sound-card-pcie-7-1-digital-inout-dolby-dts-eax-192khz-24bit-asio  and  http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Vendor-Asus  Amazon.de appears to list it for under 150â‚¬. E.g.  http://www.amazon.de/Asus-D2X-interne-Soundkarte-Digital/dp/B0011BC1FO/  It is also an ASIO sound card.
As far as hardware compatibility goes, you're fine. The 750 Ti is indeed PCI-E 3.0, and the motherboard in the model you linked supports it. So since the motherboard slot and the GPU are both PCI-E 3.0 x16, the GPU should fit just fine. The dimensions of the card are 6.70" x 4.38" if you'd like to measure for yourself. It's also a dual-slot card, so keep in mind that you won't be able to use the slot below the PCI-E slot.  Replacing the GPU is extremely simple, and there are tons of YouTube videos on it. There's really no need to get someone to do it for you, unless it's a friend or family member that would do it for free.
I suggest the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO. For one the cooler you have is huge for a cooler and actually has a bunch of people worrying about the same problem you have. Because the EVO is not meant to do anything more than keep your CPU cool it is much smaller and pack almost the same punch as the Macho. In addition, the Macho is double the weight of the EVO. As far as I could tell you only need a CPU cooler and nothing more, and that's what the EVO will do for you.
Short Answer: Yes there are power banks that can do that. However, the power bank must support the feature and your phone.A famous brand of power banks can support this feature is Anker one type can be found on Amazon. There are cheaper ones.   Output: However, this is strongly advised! First, being that you power bank will exponentially increase in heat depending on your phone. Second, the power bank will from now on take a double amount of time to charge up than not charging your phone at the same time. Third, depending on your phone it will take even longer to charge your phone even once you go back to an adapter and a outlet in the wall. Choose wisely.
Its a bit tricky. There's three elements to your problem and each of this needs to be handled seperately. Data, Power and 'space'  Easiest way? USB 3.0 Hard drives. They are typically fast enough for bulk storage these days, though clearly you arn't going to get blazing fast speeds. A 2.5 inch drive goes up to 2tb, which is pretty impressive data density, and this is the neatest solution. You could also get an enclosure with more drive bays connected over NUC. Newer NUCs would do thunderbolt wihich is even faster.  This is the sane way to do this. I did once figure out how you could get 3 drives into a NUC tho. This is entirely theoretical and somewhat impractical IMO.  If you need more speed, you can trade your wifi adaptor for more storage - a mini pci-e adaptor can be broken out to sata for 2 more drives, which takes care of your data.  Power is tricky - You might be able to split the internal sata power adaptor or get a power brick specially designed for hard drives. Split this and you have power for the hard drives. They are laptop drives so power needs might be low but something like this should cover it handily  Space? Intel has an option to 3d print lids. Design a new lid to hold the drives, 3d print it. Hard drives are pretty standardized.  Personally, the USB 3.0 HDD option or external drive bays are the way to go, especially since you can turn off unwanted drives as needed.
If you want a non NUC class machine, just go with a mini ITX system. They arn't as ludicrously small but they have more expansion capability.  Looking at these reviews something like the asrock 3150 or 3700 based boards might be a good fit - up to 4 Sata ports (or even 2 in the alternatives) one mini pcie slot (which might be good for 2 more) and a PCIe slot (which might be good for even more).  Physical size depends on your case and power supply, but this would be a better fit for "I need a ton of hard drives for as little space and power as possible"  Outside of physical form factor, these are fairly similar to nuc class machines and ought to have similar power use. Of course, form factor depends on your case, and such, and this won't be barely the size of a 3.5 inch drive, but you can pick drives as needed for maximum density
My go-to is the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite (ERL). The kind of features you're looking for aren't often in consumer routers, though if I had to bet I would figure Asus would be the best place to start. Asus's latest line of routers run a proprietary version of DD-WRT, which ASUS has incorporated their own drivers into and such. Many other CFWs for routers have much better implementations (Toastman's Tomato/TomatoUSB builds, for one), I have to imagine some consumer routers support some types of very basic QoS, and aren't very configurable.  The point of saying this is that real QoS, or the newer Traffic Shaping Policies (a subset of QoS that's not just rate limiting for specific services) is really going to be robustly included in higher end routers. Traffic shaping is more what you're looking for, because where QoS usually has hard limits for particular services or devices, traffic shaping can allow all unused bandwidth to go to lowest priority queues. Then, when a higher priority queue begins taking traffic, the bandwidth is dynamically reallocated to the expected (defined) values. If Ping is specifically very important to you, you'd add port 23 to a high priority queue, for instance. Luckily, routers the the ERL and ERX are on the market with a very disruptive cost. They run a form of Vyatta, which is highly configurable and true enterprise class. The Ubiquiti support forums are a great place to start if you run into any issues, but the latest version of EdgeOS support Smart Queues through the GUI, so I imagine you'll have an easy time getting exactly what you'd like. If you feel you need to make tweaks or change the queue type, that can be done through the command line to the full extent as is supported in Vyatta.  Here are the release notes for the current firmware, and these include directions for setting up a basic smart queue (which is proabbly all you'd really need): http://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeMAX-Updates-Blog/EdgeMAX-EdgeRouter-software-release-v1-7-0/ba-p/1287631  Here's the product page, when the ERL and ERX can be found: https://www.ubnt.com/products/#all/routing  Edit: I forgot to mention above that traffic shaping can still have reserved bandwidth for certain services which allows instant allocation of bandwidth to that queue. It's important to note that Eric does this in Gargoyle by default when optimizing for RTT. That is to say that MinRTT is a preconfigured set of QoS rules that are optimized to reserving bandwidth to reduce RTT (30%-50%, from what I understand of the Wiki): http://www.gargoyle-router.com/wiki/doku.php?id=qos The reason it's important to note this is to understand that MinRTT isn't an "application" or "mode of operation" for these devices that is missing or has an equivalent elsewhere. There's no black magic or crazy behind the scene action, it's really just QoS implemented for a specific purpose. Any robust QoS implementation can achieve the same results, meaning that you just need a decent QoS toolkit on a router to achieve the desired result. ERLs provide that toolset, and you may have to experiment and create threads (https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeMAX/bd-p/EdgeMAX) to achieve the desired result.
The issue with your question is there's no allusion or reference to compute requirements. This puts some of your requirements at odds with each other. Observe:   IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7-6920HQ Processor (6th Generation)   Base Freq. 2.9 GHz. 4 Cores, 8 Threads 8M Cache MSRP: $568 ARK Link  IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i3-6100H Processor (6th Generation)   Base Freq. 2.7 GHz. 2 Cores, 4 Threads 3M Cache MSRP: $225 ARK Link    So, the first processor is one of the best mobile processors available right now. It's also over twice as expensive as one of the lowest end current generation processors. The low end processor may meet your needs if each VM is not doing anything, or if the load is primarily on one or two VMs at a time.  Thus, what may be better for you is recomendations for what to look for, and you can adjust what you get based on your needs.  What to look for in a CPU for virtualization   Virtualization Technologies Support   IntelÂ® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d): I believe you'd have to go very low end to find a processor that didn't support VT-d, but check to make sure you have it. These technologies (along with VT-x) greatly enhance VM performance by reducing the arbitration between the VM and the actual processor. Cores vs. Threads: Hyperthreading is great, but it is not another core. GENERALLY: i3 processors have 2 cores and HT enabled. i5's have 4 cores without hyperthreading. i7's have 4 cores with hyperthreading. ((Not a hard and fast rule, follow the links to the 6th Gen list of each device to see what I mean)) More cores is better than fewer when looking at actual compute power, but hyperthreading is a great way to get a little additional bang for your buck. Consider your expected load (including a potential load on the host) when picking a core count. Speed vs. Cores: I always break this out into speed vs. cores, because I think the generally referenced low GHz vs. high GHz is too obvious and a bit dated. So many applications are multithreaded these days that having more cores is almost always better than fewer high-speed cores. This is especially true of running many VMs, where each virtualized processor can be considered an application thread (for the sake of simplicity). If you have a choice between fewer cores at a higher speed, and more cores at a lower speed, get additional cores. Cache Size: All these VMs are going to be sharing a processor cache. Even though the i7 above only has twice as many cores as the i3, it's Cache is 2M larger than twice that of the i3. That will make a big difference in your expected performance of these VMs. All the quad-core i5's have 6M cache, for your reference, so that's another cost you have to decide if you're willing to absorb or not. This will help the VM's to feel less sluggish; with more cache shared among the VMs, the likelihood of having a cache hit (where the information a VM is looking for is in cache) goes up drastically. If the information isn't there, it has to go to memory, or worse, to storage for the info. Which brings to to my final point... Bus Speed: Most processors of the same generation will have similar bus speeds, but don't neglect to check. If you're going to get RAM that is fast, you need to make sure your processor supports the speeds advertised by the RAM, and that your FSB doesn't become saturated. By having a higher DMI3 speed, there's more headroom on the bus for the processor to get the information it needs from RAM, or elsewhere.    That's about all I can do for you. I understand the scope of HR limits the question range, but I should like to offer a few other tips for VM performance that can help keep costs low while boosting performance considerably (keeping it within range of the more general question you're asking, 'What can I do with hardware to ensure my VMs perform well'):  Lots of RAM, even if it's a bit slower: Having a lot of RAM is better than having less, super fast RAM for VMs. The issue here is we want to keep as much as we can in as fast a medium as possible. More RAM accomplishes this, and prevents the system from having to go to storage for information.  Get an SSD for your OS Cache: Called the page file in Windows, this little area is "virtual memory" that the OS uses for things that it thinks don't belong in RAM, but still wants to keep in "memory". Having a faster system cache (by comparison to HDD) will make a huge difference. A 60 GB SSD dedicate to this task will pay out dividends in performance. This is why most high performance NAS devices have SSD backed read and write caches.
Have a look at SimpleNAS Pro. It is based on Banana Pi, costs under $100, has a SATA controller and it allows 2 HDD in RAID0/1 configuration.
Theoretically, you can use a SATA port multiplier Intel NUC. Another option is a dirt cheap SimpleNAS Pro, which is based on Banana Pi and allows 2 HDDs in RAID0/1 configuration.
Intel Galileo Gen 2 costs ~$80, has Ethernet and USB, runs Yocto Linux (or Debian) and has 8MB Flash memory and 8kb EEPROM memory built in, where you can store your encrypted data. It is not bullet-proof, but still more secure than Raspberry Pi.
One option is Particle (f.k.a. Spark) Photon - STM32F205 ARM Cortex M3 microcontroller with Broadcom BCM43362 Wi-Fi module, 1MB flash, 128KB RAM for $19.  Second option is WiFiMCU - STM32F411CE ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller with Broadcom  Wi-Fi module, 2MB SPI flash, 512KB on-chip flash, 128KB RAM for $10.  Another option is a much cheaper NodeMCU - ESP8266 microcontroller with 64 KB SRAM, 96KB DRAM, 4MB flash for $4.  The last option is SparkFun ESP8266 Thing - also based on ESP8266 with On-board LiPo battery charger for $16.  All of MCUs support full TCP/IP stack and partial SSL.
a) If you feel like spending then something like MIT's inFORM would be suitable for you (basically what you've asked for).  b) Look at braille "monitors", but that's far from what you've asked.  c) You could build one yourself if you have time but no money.   About choice c:   You can use standard (not LED) light bulbs (there are really small ones available too, like 3mm diameter ones), set them up in a 10x10 array. Light up the ones that need to form the display using a display controller, meaning a blind person can sense the heat generated by the bulbs. To control the bulbs you can use a microcontroller like Arduino Mega and send the characters to it with a PC program via USB. It would in overall cost you about ~50$ (plus 20$ for a uber cheap soldering iron) but hours of time, soldering together the array, programming the arduino and creating the desktop program will take respectively about 10h, 20h and 30h (about 60 work hours in total) if you have never done something like that ever and need to learn it all.
Since your main concerns are "not a downgrade from a GMA950" and "dual VGA support", I recommend a VisionTek Radeon 7000, $36 from Newegg.  It's an absolutely ancient card (released 15 years ago), but the Tom's Hardware hierarchy puts it on the same performance tier as the nearly-as-ancient GMA950.  It's got one VGA output and one DVI output with a DVI-to-VGA adapter, it uses one of your board's PCI slots rather than a PCIe slot, and it's well-supported by the open-source ATI drivers (R100 column).  I haven't found a solid source for maximum resolution, but it appears to be at least 1600x1200.  Alternatively, if you can find one, I recommend a GeForce 5200, again with a PCI interface.  One VGA and one DVI-I is common, it's somewhat more powerful than either the Radeon 7000 or the GMA950, and it's got decent support by the open-source drivers.  If you really want to use your PCIe slot, a few 5200 boards used an AGP-to-PCIe adapter chip to give them a PCIe interface.
Consider using the Enermax Ostrog. Although it does not meet the USB Type-C requirement (Which I honestly doubt that any case under $60 would have at this point), it does fufil your other requirements. I have personally used this case in the past, and I can say that it does indeed work well. On a side note, the side panel is essentially one huge window; which means weekly cleaning (At least I did). Great case that can be had at Frys for $44
GE62 6QF Apache Pro  You have multiple options in my opinion.    See if your shop offers this Laptop with a SSD. This would be the easiest option for you probably       Get a M.2 SSD - your laptop supports the new M.2 SSD's which are even faster than the regular SSD's. If a normal user really needs this is questionable but having the option is nice. It is more expensive though. If you want to get a M.2 SSD you can get it here. Any of these should work -  pick one which suits your budget and read some reviews when you have doubts. You would have to add this to your laptop yourself but there are some How-To's on Youtube. I have made some good experiences with the Crucial and Intel SSD's - they were reliable and deliver a great performance. EDIT: Your Laptop supports M.2 SSD's with a formfactor of 22x80mm.  Source: Manual for this Laptop     But your manual does not say which M.2 Key Port it features - there are 2 different ones.  Source: Kingston SM2280S3 120GB M.2 SATA SSD Review on legitreview.com  Your best bet when buying a M.2 SSD is to buy one with a B&M Connector. These will fit the M.2 Port always. So your best bet would be this Intel 535 M.2 SSD 240 GB from Intel for example:  This will fit your laptops M.2 SSD port :)     Source: Intel ARK Page of this article    If you want to buy a SSD from another company then make sure to get one with B&M key connector and with a formfactor of 22x80mm.     Get a regular SSD. Your Laptop has a built-in DVD-drive - if you are not intending to use it that much you could swap it out and replace it with a SSD. If you plan on doing that you would have to get yourself a SSD and a SSD/HDD Cage. Then you would have to replace your HDD-drive with this cage which houses your SSD.      So it depends on which road you want to take. You can't go really wrong with many of these. My Suggestion would be a Intel 535 M.2 SSD. But if you want to replace your DVD-Drive with a SSD then I'd probably go for the Crucial MX200 or BX100    I hope that this helps you a bit - if you still can't decide which one to buy or which path to take then feel free to leave a comment. I'll try to update the answer accordingly :)
HP Pavilion 14-ab057ca is a good choice. It has :     Intel Core i5-5200U 750 GB HDD (if it you don't mind breaking the warranty, you can just change it) Intel HD Graphics 5500 (Can runs recent games pretty fine, even if it's reputation says the contrary) Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Blu-Ray drive (compatible with DVDs) I can play "Just Cause 2" during 2 hours on battery. Battery life isn't a problem Linux runs smooth on it (Startup in only 10 seconds >_<) (You're gonna need the "wl" driver for using the Wi-Fi card on it. Advanced touchpad features are gonna need little hacks) 1 SD Card slot, 3 USB ports You can boot from the USB, not sure about SD Card. 6 GB DDR3 RAM (You can change it) A touchpad (You can use two-finger scroll, like on Mac)   I bought mine for 650$ CAD (approximately 450 $ USD)
There are two tablets which are officially supported by Replicant - a fully open source Android distribution - namely Galaxy Tab 2 10.1" and Galaxy Tab 2 7.0". However, they run on proprietary hardware and firmware.  Another possibility is an open source LuneOS Linux distribution, which runs on HP Touchpad. But it has proprietary hardware as well.  We will see if BQ Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Tablet is fully open source when it hits the shelves.
Dell i7559-763is a superb laptop for programmers and also for game developers.This laptop comes with 8GB DDR3L,256GBSSD 6TH generation Intel core processor.It has 15.6 inch IPS screen with anti-glare technology.
This fan will do the job perfectly, as I installed it 2 weeks ago.  http://noctua.at/en/nf-a9-pwm.html  The CPU will not go over 48 Degrees C, no matter the load.
I've yet to find a compact keyboard with a track pad below the keys that I like, even on laptops. I find that I hit the track pad with my wrists and that randomly clicks everywhere.   I had, however, found a keyboard that has a track pad off to the side that I like. It's not as compact as a small laptop's keyboard, but it is still significantly smaller than my desktop's keyboard.  I like the Logitech K400.    Pros   Does not contain a number pad. In it's place is the track pad. Hopefully this is ok for the shoulder. The Ctrl is in the lower left corner. I agree with you about the FN key. It is not in the lower left. Feels similar to laptop keyboards I've used.  Contains a multi-touch track pad built in The Alt seem easy enough to reach to me. I don't recall ever being annoyed by that button.   Cons   My only complaint is about the right shift button. Instead of the usual long button, it occupies a single button position. Personally, it doesn't bother me, but I've had others that utilize it complain occasionally. I've had laptops with this layout though, so I may be used to it.
The 750W PS is perfectly fine for your config.  This is just my opinion: I usually go for more smaller drives than less larger drives. If you get 8 600GB drives you will get the same storage capacity (or very close to it, depends on how they are formatted by the FS) but you will get a large speed bonus, which will generally be a good thing if this server is going to run VMs that are I/O intensive.  If this server absolutely needs to be running 24/7 i would also get a secondary PS and run it on a different power circuit. If one goes down than the other one can take over.
I would recommend the Dell Inspiron 15 7559 Notebook  (specifications here) According to the above website    It has a 15.6 Inch Screen It has a GTX 960M GPU It has a Intel Core i7-6700HQ CPU (Specs here)   And the battery specs:  Idle (without WLAN, min brightness) : 11h 49min  WiFi Surfing v1.3 : 3h 52min  Load (maximum brightness) : 1h 16min  Hope that helps
I would get the same fan that is on the cooler. You know that it will fit on the cooler and have the same performance. I would make sure that you have enough room on the other side of the cooler before purchasing the additional fan, as it look like you might have another heat sink in the way (it might not be, its just hard to tell from your picture at that angle).   It appears that this fan is the same one that comes with the cooler. If you do not decide to get the same fan, I would get a fan that has the same RPM as the one on the cooler, as the fan with the lower RPM will just get in the way of the faster fan, reducing the cooling effectiveness.
Solid State Drives use about 8W of power while HDD use 12W or so on average. That doesnt directly show heat output but it should help you get an idea. So SSD aren't any hotter than HDD besides NVME ssd's. For example NVME 950 Pro from samsung is known to get upto 100C and start thermal throttling to prevent damage. If you dont know what NVME is then i will just tell you that as long as you are using a red SATA cable to connected the drive to the mobo you are fine.
The Intel CPU is generally better, especially in single thread applications, and with the Skylake platform you can upgrade to i7 6700k down the road when it gets cheaper. However, it is most certainly not worth the extra money if you have to change the motherboard and RAM. Keep in mind that you cant really upgrade that much on that AMD socket.
I have been looking at different laptops and cannot see one with a Mac keyboard layout.  You could buy a Macbook (I found one which has your specs here) and install Windows OS on it.  You can find a tutorial on installing Windows on Mac here  Hope that helps
The trend for a smaller and a compact smartphone is decreasing. I'd still recommend the moto g1/2 if you don't mind sticking on to android 5.1.1. If you don't mind a little bit bigger screen at 13 cm then go for the nexus 5x .
Why didn't anyone recommend the nexus 6p?? It is the latest nexus out there and scores virtually in almost all the aspects you mentioned and even exceeds a few  Gorgeous display- boasts a QHD AMOLED and it is the best display on a smartphone and takes on samsung's flagships.

I finally worked out what 1GB effective memory actually means in the EAX1550. ATI has a feature on some of their cards called HyperMemory which allows the card to steal some of the the systems main memory (RAM). The reason for doing this is that it allows for ATI to produce cheap video cards with a large amount of processing memory without the need for expensive on board memory.   The downside to this is that it requires the system to surrender a portion of its RAM for graphics processing. Also, due to the fact that a large portion of the GPU's memory is not on board, large amounts of data must be moved between the card and the main system causing some latency issues.  As for which one plays Skyrim better, i have yet to run some tests but i will probably post my very unofficial results here for anyone who is interested. (My money is on the card without HyperMemory, as it should run slightly faster, albeit with less memory)
These are the two routers which match your requirements and these were released recently. These are tri-band routers which do not reduce speed even when multiple devices are connected to the same network i.e A tri-band router is literally hosting two separate 5 GHz networks, and it automatically sorts devices into different networks. This offers more speed to share among your devices even if you are using heavy data on one network (eg;- 4k).   Asus RT-AC3200 Tri-Band Router - 200â‚¬ It has six adjustable antennas featuring three bands 2.4Ghz(1) and 5Ghz(2) It has solid performance in the 5Ghz band and has a bunch of features like multiple LED indicators. It under performs when handling files through LAN(file transferring) and it is a tad expensive.  D-Link AC3200 Ultra Wi-Fi Router (DIR-890L/R)- 200â‚¬ Similar to the Asus it has 6 antennas with tri-band, 2.4Ghz and two 5Ghz bands. It has an awesome build and a multiple LED indicators like the Asus. It can really handle files and heavy data without breaking a sweat. Even though it has very less cons it is priced at an expensive price point.
There are not many good bluetooth options available, but I've listed out a couple of the best   Nolan MIC Bluetooth Wireless Microphone - 64$   Bluetooth connectivity Range - 100ft(30m) Battery life - 6hr(moderate usage) Good customer reviews   If you can slightly bump up your price barrier then,  Sony ECMAW4 Wireless Microphone - 150$ (can get it for a lot cheaper offline)   better audio quality  can pair with other devices like camcorders  can't pair with phones directly great customer reviews avg. battery Range - 164ft (Sony's claim)   Do check all the customer reviews of both the products on amazon and there is also a video about the latter product on its review page.

I recommend the Lenovo Y50. It has a GTX 960M, which is a relatively powerful graphics card. It also has a powerful i7 processor and a 1080p screen. It is also one of the most affordable gaming laptop at around US$800.
Personally speaking, the power supplies that come with cases are normally not very good. I tend to buy just standard ATX PSU's for my builds. They are very quiet. I don't think you will be drawing enough power to make it kick in the fans on full mode but you should be fine with either option.  In my freeNAS server, I have a Corsair 500w power supply. Whisper quiet. The only noise that comes from the tower is the CPU fan.
As khmer11 said, the PSUs in cases are terrible. A 150w - 300w PSU will be optimal and be at peak efficiency, but a 400-500w PSU will still work well. If you choose the 150w - 300w PSU then you will be limited if you do any upgrades (e.g. change to a more powerful CPU or add a GPU) but it you will be fine if you choose the 400 - 500w PSU. Another thing you should look for when choosing PSU is the efficiency rating. I recommend at least 80 Plus Bronze rating since it is a good combination of good efficiency, value and durability.
Nvidia Optimus is a technology that allows automatic switching between the Nvidia GPU and the integrated GPU. This allows less power to be used when less GPU intensive programs are used. This is not a factor that effects VR.  The minimum recommended requirement is the GTX 970 GPU, this is less powerful than the 980M and more powerful than the 970M. Since VR requires extremely stable framerate, running at less than minimum requirements can make the experience less enjoyable and can cause motion sickness. So I would recommend a 980M.
If you want a VR ready notebook it has to have Nvidia GeForce GTX980, so it will be a top end notebook. Asus ROG G752VT isn't VR Ready because it has a GTX970M which does not support VR.     I would choose one of the MSI top end notebooks which cost around $3000 (both are VR Ready).    $3099 - MSI GT Series GT72S DomPro4K-059 (this one have 4K display, but less RAM memory 16GB) $2999 - MSI GT Series GT72S DomProG-070 (this one have Full HD display and 32 GB RAM memory)
There are several developers working towards this right now! Unfortunately most of these projects are still in the "Crowdfunding" or "Pre-order" stages.  One promising board, the "UP-Board" currently on Pre-Order: http://www.up-board.org/     $99   2GB RAM   16GB EMMC memory   Intel processor (Compatible with Windows 8.1/10, Unknown if compatible with Linux)   Another promising board, the "Lattepanda" currently still in the Pre-Order stage located here     $89   2GB RAM   32GB EMMC memory   Intel atom (quad-core) processor (Compatible with Windows 8.1/10, Linux various)   Honorable mentions:     MinnowbardMAX   JaguarBoard   If you are looking for a board that is currently available at your price point and also X86, you are out of luck. However, if you upped your price point by between $50-$100, you'd find some neat boards on Amazon  NOTE: I am involved with the Lattepanda project as a backer, however I do not own or operate it.

Most microcontroller boards less than $20 do not have Bluetooth/Wifi/Eth, or LCD ports. The Raspberry Pi is your best bet, but if you need something a bit cheaper with the same capabilities, I'd look at the PINE A64, Currently on pre-order.  $15 gets you: -64bit Quad Core ARM A53 1.2GHz CPU -512MB DDR3 SDRAM -MicroSD Slot Supports up to 256GB -10/100 Mb Ethernet port -2 x USB 2.0 host -4K x 2K HDMI port -3.5mm Stereo Output mini-jack with Microphone Support  For the integrated LCD panel port, you will need to upgrade to the $19 model. It also adds: -1GB RAM instead of 512MB -4-lane MIPI video port port (LCD) -Touchscreen port -1000MB ethernet -5MP Camera port
I'm currently doing 4k gaming - a 980TI is probably the most sensible option - its 90% of the performance of this generation's titan at 75% of the cost stock but I'd wait for the next generation if possible. On one hand they promise massive improvements. On the other hand, last gen hardware is cheaper.  What do I base this on?  I'm running a ivy bridge core i7 with 16 gb of ram. I'm rarely ram or CPU throttled. I do have a 980ti which performs adequately for my needs. That said I don't seem to think I hit the limits of my video card ram, and I seem to have some headroom with my GPU with most games, and I usually turn it up past the nvidia recommended settings. .  My advice would be to do a video card upgrade, but to wait a bit. If you must buy one now, while its pricy, a 980TI is likely your best option for dx11, single card gaming. That said, the next generation should have similar performance or better, and there's a few new interesting technologies - smaller process sizes and Ram varients that might make it worth the wait. Don't get me wrong, my current card is glorious but we should be seeing things like HBM this year on most cards.   That said, things may change soon - AMD's cards are doing really well at dx12 (and there's big price cuts on the high end R9s), and vulcan's coming out. And of course new cards promising more performance.
MSI H81M-P33 LGA 1150 Intel H81 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard  Here's what you get with a $45.99 price tag: -6 USB ports (4x2.0, 2x3.0) -Compatible with Core i7 / i5 / i3 / Pentium / Celeron (LGA1150) -DDR3 1600/ 1333/ 1066 RAM -MicroATX -One Ethernet port (you won't find a motherboard with two at less than $250)  It comes with a standard PCIx connector, which should fit most common Graphics cards. Also, you did not specify the socket for the i5 you have, but according to Intel it uses the LGA1150 connector, which this board comes with.  As for your dual network requirements, might I suggest this nifty 150Mbs USB WiFi adapter or this USB 2.0 to Ethernet adapter from Amazon. They are very compatible, and just about as good as you'll get under $10. For another $7, you can get a USB 3.0 to Ethernet adapter for a much faster 1000Mbs over the 100Mbs of the USB 2.0 adapter.
First solution - perfect match but expensive.  Asus prepared solution which is perfect for your requirements but it's really expensive and it's over your budget. It's ASUS CS-B:  It meets your requirements:  Dual LAN:    IntelÂ® I217LM RealtekÂ® 8111G   USB Ports    2 x USB 3.0 4 x USB 2.0   It's mATX.  But:  Cost: $200 (Amazon US)     Second solution - better and cheaper   You should just use @john kieran solution.
After reviewing my answer your CPU is compatible only with 990FX motherboards. So I deleted second option because it wasn't compatible with your CPU. I also added cheaper alternative which will work in your setup.    MSI 990FXA GAMING - 149.99 on newegg  This motherboard meets all your requirements and is good for OC. Additionally it has really good software. It's really solid construction.  ASUS M5A99FX PRO R2.0 - 134.99 on newegg  This is cheaper alternative which is also good constuction and meets your requirements.
You're right: it'll work as long as the last hub will be a powered one. Remember that you have only 5 hops 5 meter cables which gives 20m tops (because last hop is from hub to USB keyboard/gamepad.  IMHO buying "active" cables is pointless, you'll be better of buying few regular, 4-port hubs and 5-meter cables.  But this all is unnecessary hassle: have you tried using wireless keyboard, mouse and joypad? They usually work very good over several meters and walls at home. If they don't, use one usb cable to position receiver better, this does the trick in most cases.
What I'm proposing is a hack, involving two-sided scotch tape and splicing wires: DELL AS501 or AX510. They can be bough for as little as 5â‚¬ used or 10â‚¬ new. They're simple, one-piece analog devices with 3.5mm jack audio input and 5.5mm barrel plug 12V input.    Power supply can be a slight problem without compatible Dell monitor, but it's still relatively simple to either match a 12V/1A power supply (just watch the polarity) or to splice the cable and power it directly from some 12V source you already have (like your desktop PSU).
Here are my recommendations: 1, LotFancy 13-15.6 inch laptop cooler   - Dual fan   - 73% 5 star rating (out of 176)   - $16.30    2, Cooler Master NotePal X2 - Single fan - 78% overall positive rating (out of 7,332) - $29.99  3, EGOGO 12"-17" Laptop Cooler - Quad fan - Dual controlled cooling zones - Dual USB port - $19.99  Now that the Amazon links are working, I can honestly say the TekNet cooler looks best for your situation. It has about as many features as you can possibly get in a laptop cooler, and it has a moderate number of reviews, most of which are positive. As for the side cooler, I would recommend using the TekNet with a separate side cooler, so you can have all the neat features instead of compromising.  The HAVIT HV-F2061 Mini LED USB Vacuum Turbine Air Extracting Cooling Fan Cooler has: - Temperature LCD - Automatic/Manual adjustable speed - Quad head dispenser - Fits almost any laptop - $19.99
The Samsung is much more durable since all the components are manufactured in house and they have very strict quality control. They are both TLC, but the Samsung has a really good TLC flash chip. The Samsung SSD is also much faster than the ADATA.
I'm going for Samsung SSD 850 EVO.   After some research i found ADATA's TLC is a poor performer. In real world file transfer read speed was decent but writing can bring the SP550 to its knees. Sequential write is averaged about 50 mbps, where as Samsung 850 EVO is able to maintain so much better performance.  we can push our self to spend extra bucks to get a quality product.
Most of the models linked here have fans mounted in a fashion that makes them work like axial fans with a big dead spotÂ¹ in the middle and directly blowing at the mostly closed surface or trying to suck air from it, which probably causes more turbulence in the fan itself than actual cooling of the device. I don't think this is a very efficient design, neither do I think that the mentioned extracting cooler fan helps support the CPU cooler in the laptop doing it's job better. It tries to get the hot air out faster, but doesn't help getting fresh and cool air into the system.  We had some older very hot running laptops in the office here in Germany. I bought an Arctic NC suitable for 14 and 15 inch sized laptops which made it run significantly cooler and I have used it since then for most of the laptops I worked with in the office. It's rather small and mostly quiet. I would recommend looking for such a device that works more like a radial design and covers the entire surface without any dead spots. The downside of this particular cooler is, that your laptop only stands on two points on this fan which may be bit unstable in some cases compared to the other designs.      As I said I live in Germany where it doesn't get very hot and our offices are outside of town, my co-worker in Hungary living in a not well ventilated apartment had more severe heat problems with the same laptop model (trying to cool with +40Â°C fresh air). So it also depends on where you live.     TMD fans were proposed as a solution to the dead spot problem more than 10 years ago, but never got as popular as the radial based designs you can find today.
Based on your picture, and description involving "U" and "Q", it sounds like you are thinking of a product from Ubiquiti Networks. There was a very detailed article about them on Ars Technica last October.  The only issue is, they don't have have a router that looks similar to your image. There are Access Points though.  One of the ones that Ars reviewed was the UniFi AP AC Pro. You can get this directly from Ubiquiti (when it isn't sold out) for $150.
I use the basic version of Kindle  It can do all the following things:   copy a PDF in a folder formats and uploads it to the e-reader.   In addition, I use an app called Calibre which makes that process very simple and effortless. I generally use epub version books, compatible with iBooks. However, Calibre formats them according to Kindle's format and uploads them to the device.  So, copying files is a breeze with (Kindle + Calibre).
This LVDS driver board from ebay has a quoted max resolution of 2048X1152.  It says in the description that when you order the board, you need to supply the model number of your LCD panel so they can give you the correct kit.
If you are worried about building a machine, don't build it. You may lose out a tiny bit on hardware, but in return you usually get limited manufacturer support. The trade off between more hardware and more support is a valid reason to buy pre-built (and configured) hardware.  The next question you need to answer for yourself, is whether you are going to actually upgrade your hardware at some point or are you just going to plan on doing it, but never get around to it. Everyone wants more hardware to throw at stuff, but if you are not actually going to utilize it to it's fullest potential at some point, there is no sense in buying a machine that can have it's capacity doubled. Instead, focus on maximizing the hardware now. It sounds like this is going to be an experiment in visualization for you. It may be worth while to simply build a machine that works for now and see if visualization will work as you are hoping. If it does, consider this experiment a success and plan a truly beefy machine in a few years time to replace this proof of concept.     For my recommendations, I've made a few assumptions that may or may not fit your situation.    Your goal is to have server versions of the operating systems be visualized. Thus, you won't be running full desktop GUIs (frequently) The goal is to have at least the minimum amount of RAM each operating system requires. You will run 3 VMs You will upgrade this machine to utilize more of it's capabilties at some point     The server you found on Amazon, doesn't appear to work for your requirements, as is. There are a few things that will trip you up in this case.  First, there are only 8 GB of RAM included. Personally, I wouldn't consider that "lots of RAM".   Second, it doesn't come with hard drives. That means you have to decide what kind of storage space you want. On top of that, the drive bays don't appear to be included and the reviews say there isn't a place to mount regular drives. Configuring the storage, once you've gotten it, is an exercise left to you. Do you want one giant array? Do you want mirrored RAID? Do you want individual drives? You have to decide an configure the system.  Finally, the CPU is 6 cores. This means, that with 3 VMs, each of your VM can have only 2 cores. Depending on the type of development you do, this may or may not be enough.  On the plus side, this server appears to support dual power supplies. Only one is included, but if you wanted you could add a second one.     Now, can we make this server work? I think you can. Especially, since the price on Amazon is about $400 cheaper than I can find elsewhere. Let's use that to upgrade the specs.  This machine can handle a lot more hardware. The specs sheet from Lenovo shows what it can do.    CPU: Up to two 10-core Intel Xeons. Ram: Up to 192 GB Drives: Up to 12 3.5" drives / 16 2.5" drives (requires the second power supply)   So, assuming we can't get all of that for $1,500, let's find something reasonable.   RAM: Add at least another 16GB for a total of at least 24GB for an additional $110 (per 16 GB). Drives: If you want speed, get a few SSDs. If you want storage, get a few spinning drives. If you want a combination of speed and storage, mix it up. This is going to cost you a few hundred though. Adding in drive bays for the 3.5" drives at $15 each, adds an additional $15-$60 (assuming you are only filling 4 bays).   Right now, the total cost is roughly $1,200-$1,300. For this, you get a system that has manufacturer support (of some kind), states in it's spec sheets that it is compatiable with a variety of operating systems (including VMware ESXi and Citrix XenServer), and has been upgraded above basic levels. It is also $200-$300 under budget (excluding taxes and shipping). It will require you to add a bit of hardware yourself though.  If you are willing to go over your budget by a couple hundred, it may be useful to look at filling that second CPU slot. The system already comes with one Intel Xeon E5-2420 v2 2.2GHz 6C/12T. A second one will cost you about $650. Before you do this, though, consider how you are going to use this machine. Are you going to use it as an experiment and see if this works? If so, adding the second CPU at this point may be overkill.
While Peter has explained why Nvidia Optimus is a problem and ivaan has proved that even a 980M won't work. If the laptops, MSI GT Series GT72S DomPro4K-059 and MSI GT Series GT72S DomProG-070 are too expensive. I would suggest going with a Razer Blade Stealth with Razer Core or Alienware 13 with a graphics amplifier. They will allow you to keep your price low while being VR compatible in a flexible way.
Assuming I understand what you're looking for, as LCD monitors don't really refresh per-se, you may just need a monitor with higher response times. Try searching for monitors <3ms response time. This will be a more cost friendly solution if it meets your needs. There is very helpful information at this link to help you understand the differences. See: http://www.tweakguides.com/Graphics_7.html (Be sure to click the next at the bottom left to read more.)  If you truly need a higher refresh rate then first you're going to need a high end graphic interface such as a HDMI or Display-Port with a graphics card that supports the higher refresh rates. (Refer to that link I posted for details supporting this.) Also, depending on how you're images are rendered, VSync may help if you're experiencing tearing.   That said, NewEgg is a website I really like to shop on because of it's search engine. You can search by the features you need and require and narrow it down from there including refresh rate and response times. There is a Dell on their site that meets all your criteria except it's 27" and Â£412.99 plus shipping. You can always buy your monitor elsewhere but this site can help you narrow your search. See: My NewEgg Search  Personally, I find that Dell monitors, while good quality, are somewhat over priced and I, therefore, prefer other brands. As for other brands, ASUS is not a bad brand neither is LG, Samsung or View Sonic. LG and Samsung along with a few others manufacture their own LCD's as I understand, others buy their screens from others and re-brand them, but even LG and Samsung have been known to re-brand to meet price/demand.   As youâ€™re probably aware, most TVâ€™s do not truly preform at 120hz + as they claim. Also, TVâ€™s will suffer from input lag. But they do have interpolation software in the television that adds more frames in between frames from your input (which is 60Hz. Iâ€™m afraid to get the 1ms youâ€™re after, it just isnâ€™t possible yet with LCDâ€™s and current technology. 120hz at 8.333-, 144hz at 6.944, 165hz at 6.6060-, and 200hz at 5ms is the highest monitors currently available. The 240hz+ ones that Iâ€™ve seen use a TruMotion like technology, so the input is actually 120hz or even 60hz. Again these will require a high end graphics card.  If you don't currently have a high end graphics card with HDMI or DisplayPort, you'll need to see if you have a PCI-x16 slot otherwise you may have to upgrade your PC.   Here is a list of current monitors that I've found with higher refresh rates. They're all targeted for gamers, but they should suit your purpose. You may have to tweak the settings in the AMD/nVidia control panel to output the frequency you're after.  Another consideration is the method that you're delivering the media in question to the display. For example, if you're using a compressed video, the frequency of your display refresh rate will not factor in if the video encoded at 60fps. In this you'll need to use uncompressed video or video compressed at 200fps and your PC/GPU will need to be able to handle this. This is because if you have a 200hz monitor, it is writing to the screen every 5ms witch correlates to 200 frames per second. This is way beyond the capabilities of most games and videos which are typically no more than 120 fps. Though the monitor may preform at 200hz, you won't realize the full benefit unless the video is equal or higher that the monitor. For these reasons, simply a higher response time and things like TruMotion technology will probably suit your purpose.
This should work perfectly except you should note that you cannot install Windows based drivers on a Mac which means that some of the more advanced functionality on some components cannot be used.
Belkin is selling a product (USB-C 4-Port Mini Hub) which meets your requirements:  Input:    USB-C   Output:   2 x USB-C 2 x USB-A   Additional info:   5Gbps Data Transfer Speeds (shared) Powered through USB-C host device Tethered Type-C Cable for easy access Ultra-portable / Slim design Charge peripherals with 900mAh (shared)
Samsung all day, every day. Their warranty is amazing and the speeds are all at the top of the charts. I've installed several Evos and Pros in systems and have been nothing but thrilled with the results, especially in older systems.
It would cost you more to build one from scratch than just buying a used one  My recommendation is based on experience,  In last 6 months i have used 4U servers from 3 different vendors, Dell, HP, IBM  Models  Dell PowerEdge R900(more choices in HDD)  HP DL580 G5(most favorite)  IBM System X3850 M2(least favorite)  Dell PowerEdge R900  Pros   4 Quad Cores 128GB or 256GB RAM You can buy used from ebay starting $300 Maximum 16 or 10TB Storage Choice of 5 of 3.5 or 8 x 2.5 inch drives formats.   Cons   Noise level : Like a jet engine Heavy, difficult to lift and move with just one person   HP DL 580 G5  Pros   4 Quad Cores 128GB or 256GB RAM You can buy used from ebay starting $200 for 128GB Maximum 32TB or 16TB storage 8 x 2.5 inch drives or if you add another SAS RAID Card you can go up 16 x 2.5 Drives. Maximum storage 2TB per drive   Cons   Noise level : Loud but less louder than R900 Heavy, but lighter than R900 and it has hooks on both side for easy lifting so one person can lift it   IBM System X3850  Pros   4 Quad Cores 128GB or 256GB RAM You can buy used from ebay starting $200 for 128GB   Cons   Noise level : quieter compared to both DL580 and R900 Similar in weight as DL580 it has hooks on both side for easy lifting so one person can lift it Maximum 8TB Storage : 4 x 2.5 inch drives, yes only 4   My Personal Comments  I am divided between DL580 and R900. i like both of these and i have both of them at home. IBM System X3850 was Dead on arrival, machine powered on but it never recognized physical drives so i had to return it. It was quieter out of the three.  How i use them  I use them to Run Virtual Machines. I power them on when i need them. I have WOL Enabled with port forwarding for WOL so i power them on from my phone whether i am home or not. They sit in my office where i do not sit so i never hear the noise.  Storage Needs   Comparing only Dl580 and R900  I use SATA to store my data coz it's cheap and high capacity  R900 comes with either 3.5 or 2.5 inch drives. So if you storage need is 10TB or less then i would recommend going with 3.5 drives as you can get those cheaper like $50/each. and if money is not a concern then you can go with 2.5 inch drives and you can go to 8x 2TB SATA = 16TB on both R900 and DL580. one 2TB 2.5 STA would cost you around $100   Now if you have a need for even higher storage let's say 32TB Then go with Dl580 G5 you can add a second RAID card for like $15 and then just add 8 more 2.5 SATA drives so total storage 16 x 2TB = 32TB  Summary   All the above 3 machines have similar CPUs and Similar memory and storage is the key deciding factor among st others mentioned above if you want 32TB of storage get DL580 add a second RAID card you would have to purchase 16 x 2 TB 2.5 SATA Drives that would cost you $1600 just for hard Drives + Server Cost If you want 16TB of space you can go with either R900 or DL580, my blind recommendation DL580, nicer and quieter compared to R900, it would cost you $800 just for Hard Drives  + Server Cost if you are okay with 10TB of storage of less, go with R900 but make sure to get the one that takes 3.5 drives, then you need 5 x 3.5 2TB SATA Drives that's like 5 x $60 = $300 + Server Cost. Cheapest option with 10TB Capacity.
You can use HP Dl585 G5 or DL385 G5. These servers use AMD based processors  both of them take PC2_5300 RAM  DL385 G5 Specs Memory : Up to 128 GB (with PC2-5300 8GB DIMMs). PC2-6400 800MHz DDR2 Select models support 2:1 Bank Interleaving. 4:1 Bank Interleaving (Data saved across 2 pairs of DIMMs) and Node interleaving support (data saved across 2 processors memory sets) also available  http://www8.hp.com/h20195/v2/GetPDF.aspx/c04286576.pdf  DL 585 G5 PC2-5300 Registered DIMMs at 667 MHz http://www8.hp.com/h20195/v2/GetPDF.aspx/c04286140.pdf
I suppose you mean an USB 3.1 hub with USB-C on both ends. Because the USB standard does not support splitters. It always needs a hub. USB charging/power cables are the exception.  Also USB-C refers to the port not the cable itself. For example you can have USB 3.1 cable (with type C connectors) or a Thunderbolt 3 cable.   Trust and Belkin have similar mini hubs: Trust: USB TYPE-C 4 PORTS USB3.0 HUB  Be aware, both hubs (Trust and Belkin) are USB 3.1 Gen 1 (5 gbps) NOT Gen 2. So far  I haven't seen a Gen 2 (10 gbps) hub  At the moment it is just to early. I can imagine that in the near future many USB 3.1 gen 2 hubs will come to market.
Most important question is what is your budget and what will you use it for ?   Also I have some doubts about your setup and I will list them below changing some elements to "better" or "compatible":  1.Why Haswell not Skylake ?  If you are thinking about so strong setup you should think about newest platform (Skylake) and change CPU and Motherboard.   Intel Core i7-6700K ~$380 ASUS Z170 Pro Gaming ~$155   You should also change your RAM memory to higher frequency. RAM listed below is good example:   G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 32GB (4 x 8GB)    2.If it is your intetion to stay with Haswell you have few parts which won't fit in your setup.   CPU/Motherboard - You want to buy so good CPU with OC possibility (letter K at the end of CPU ) but your motherboard won't give you OC possibility. There are two ways to change it. First you can buy Motherboard with Z97 chipset to have OC possibility (for example MSI Z97 Gaming 5 ~$135). If you want to stay without OC possibility you should change i7-4690K to i7-4690. RAM which you choosed is not compatible with your Motherboard (it is DDR4 and your motherboard uses DDR3) so you should choose something like this: Crucial Ballistix Tactical 32GB (4 x 8GB).   3.If this build is prepared for gaming I would buy maximum of 16GB RAM it will be enough for a long time.  4.If you are thinking about OC in setup with this GPU and CPU I would buy a little better PSU, for example XFX TS Series P1 750W  5.Fans. They will be needed If you decide to overclock your setup.
I would recommend getting WRT400N It's trending around $15 and you might be even able to negotiate down further. www.ebay.com/itm/172094577410  These are Dual-Band wireless-N Routers, so you can use one band just for bridging between your main router and second band can be used for extending the signal further  Yes, it will pass the signal to wired networks  My Experience   I Bought mine from ecost in January 2012 for $39.99 each and i am still happy with it Took me few hours to flash them as this was my first attempt at dd-wrt My main router is downstairs and 2nd router is upstairs(my office) right above the main router physically.  I have a gigabit network switch upstairs that is connected to several machines Both routers on 192.168.1.x network and all machines connected to any of the routers are able to communicate with each other   DD-WRT Instructions  https://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Linksys_WRT400N  If you have any trouble after these instructions you can always ask for help on Super User.
Another option, for even longer distances, is a KVM over CAT5 extender. Startech has many options, among other vendors. I'd search on Amazon as the prices are generally better than buying directly from Startech.  For example, the SV565UTP (they are sold in pairs):    You take one and put it next to the computer and connect it to the machine's keyboard, mouse, and monitor outputs. You take the other one and plug a keyboard, mouse, and monitor into it. Then you run a CAT5 cable between them and you get up to 500 feet.  They make longer distance ones; there's a 650 ft VGA/USB extender, there's a whopping 1500 ft DVI/USB extender, and so on.  These are overkill for your 55 ft in terms of cost, but if you need even longer runs, or you have the budget, they're a good option. It's a lot easier to run CAT5 through walls and such than VGA / DVI, too, and cheaper to replace failed cables (or re-terminated failed connectors). If the building already has CAT5 wiring for ethernet you may be able to repurpose one of the existing runs. If you already have a network closet with a patch bay for wall jacks around the building, it also makes moving your console around in the future pretty trivial.
I used to use one of these to serve as a wireless receiver for a machine that only had an ethernet port.  TP-LINK-TL-WR702N-Wireless-Repeater  In addition to serving as a "wireless card" for my device it also could have been configured to serve as an access point, a repeater and a few other functions. Once I got it configured it worked well and never gave me any problems.  Edit:  I should add that to configure this I didn't have to do anything fancy, the device came with a small disc that contained some configuration software, I had to install the software and plug it into my computer to do the initial setup which wasn't any different than logging into your router normally would be.  Additionally there is more than one model that has this form factor (the nano size), it would behoove you to make sure the one you are looking at will be able to handle the sort of traffic you plan to run through it.
I'd rather build than buy. It really depends on your needs though.   If you're worried about noise, a home system actually makes a decent VM box.  There's a few things I go for.   More cores. Get at least a quad core. For serious work a 'mainstream' core. I like a minimum of a quad core box - a core i7 is a decent workhorse machine, but both my recommendations are xeons. I typically run single core VMs  At least 16 gigs of ram - the 'right' amount is enough ram for the host + enough ram for each VM. 8gb is a bit of a minimum I guess Enough storage. I favour SSDs for booting and speed reliant things - the samsung 850 pro 256gb is my preferred mainline SSD but the evo would work if you have the budget and want a 1tb SSD.   For reliable storage, I prefer HGST - they have a nas line of deskstars I'd suggest taking a look at, though I have a pile of older, very trusty desktar models   No OS. Most of the good VM servers are free,   If you're going to use this as a development box and want to run linux, fedora is a good bet. Excellent support for KVM and virt manager.  If you're buying as opposed to building, a dell precison might be a good option. Old workplace had them and they were tanky, reliable beasts, and they fall within your price range.  The 5000 series might be a good starting point - possibly the base model. I'd take a look at parts prices before adding any options since it may make sense to buy parts elsewhere to upgrade the ram and HDD. These things can go up to 8 cores if I remember correctly and are basically server grade parts set up as a desktop. I'm more familiar with the 7000 series, but those are for when you need two processors and is somewhat out of budget. Nonetheless, very solid machines, you're covered by the warranty, and if you're willing to spend a little extra, trivial to order what you need and know that it works  Upgrades from the base model? Up the ram to 16gb, drop the OS (most of the good VM hosts are free anyway). Get a 3TB HGST deskstar drive. I'd be tempted to slot in an SSD for the OS (I would suggest a 256gb Samsung 850 pro) , but these things take a while to boot due to the raid controller.   If you're building  Might take a bit of tweaking to get it in your budget but a X10SDV-8C+-LN2F might be a good start Its ~1000usd but that gets you 8 cores. Load it up with 32gb (4x8, or 2x16) of ram at least of the cheapest standard DDR4 ram you can find. In theory, you can go up to 128 gb with Rdimms. Don't bother with ECC in this case, not really worth it.   Its mini itx (so you can use a smaller case).  Its somewhat limited in terms of video (VGA...) but also has IPMI (for out of band management, which is cool) and is designed for being a VM host, but at reasonable power consumption. Most of the xeon-d models are interesting, but this is the 'cheapest' one I could find with a fan.   USB ports are somewhat limited as well, and you have one pciex16, but that's more than you would on a laptop.
Update: I found the socketed i5 5675C with Iris Pro 6200 (48 EU GT3e 128 MB L4) at LDLC.com  CPU: Intel Core i5 5675C with Iris Pro 6200 iGP (â‚¬289.95 @ LDLC.com) (Processor Specs @ Intel ARK)  A multiplier unlocked quad core Intel CPU, it has 48 Gen 8 EUs, comparable to the Iris 540 and 550, and double the amount of L4 eDRAM. 65W TDP.

Actually I found other solution which was much cheaper:   I resigned from using LED lighted fan because my case is lighted enough with LED stripes mounted inside it (thread about light in case). I found used (half year on 6V) fans from NZXT Switch 810 which I bought for $5 each. I connected it to motherboard via NZXT Grid+ V2 and set them to work only when GPU/CPU will reach temperature above 50 Â°C.   I'm really happy with this solution when computer is idle it's really quiet and when I start to stress my PC fans are working on RPM dependent to temperatures.    If anyone is intrested in this setup I can post some photos on the weekend.
English is not my native language so please be patient.  At work we use the Raspberry Pi 2 (model B), this device meet all your especifications.  There are many boards that may be suitable for your needs. You can check in http://www.bigboardlist.com for more options than Raspberry Pi.  Almost all of them come with at least one USB and a Ethernet Port, the performance and price varies, but I think the all meet your especifications.  Now we're seeking to buy the ODroid C1+, because for the same amount of money we could have a better processor (Maybe not the best Architecture, but best frecuency), better RAM, an OTG USB port, build-in heat sink and better GPU.  So if you plan to make a small server (like we do) you could use the Raspi2 or the Odroid C1, both of them at very low price.  (Based on the answer of @Gilles)
I finally bought an Asus ROG G551JW-DM379T following the advices of my SysAdmin (Quoting : "Asus is GOOD").   It is not too flashy Features an hybrid HDD (1Tb + 24Gb) Windows 10 Good processor (Core i7) and graphics card (GeForce GTX960M) Was quite "cheap" (980â‚¬, which allowed me to take some accessories with it)
Your motherboard is on H61 Express Chipset.  List of compatible CPUs with your motherboard. Highest compatible generation working with your motherboard is Ivy Bridge (3rd generation).   I would choose between i7 3770 or i5 3570 it depends if you need more threads.
These days there is a lot of talk about Butetooth Low Energy in home automation so you might opt for the Pi 3 which is still 35$ but comes with a BLE transceiver.  Also the PINE64 is a very cheap and poewrful alternative, with 1 GB RAM at 19$: https://www.pine64.com/product#pricing
There are a lot of SBCs (Single Board Computers) similar or competitive to the Raspberry Pi that will fulfill your requests.  They are pretty broad, and the market is pretty hot right now, so you have lots of options.  Like most, I've played around mostly with Raspberry Pis of various sort.  Aside from the B, B+, and 2, you have:   I have an ODROID C1+, and it has greater specs than the Raspberry Pi 2, with which it competes.  I loaded Android to it, but it also has Ubuntu available. I have a Beaglebone (I don't think it's the black version though), but I have not done anything with it.  It's somewhat competitive in features with Raspberry Pis, I think the original B and the B+.  This device is usually meant to run headless, though they do have HDMI ports. I have a Raspberry Pi Zero, which is neat.  I don't think it has any lower power conspumption, and it's required adapters may negate the savings of the board itself, but it is physically small, which may be a boon for your project. I have looked at the Banana Pi whilest browsing SBCs. Continuing with the fruit pies, is the Orange Pi, another full featured cheap SBC, though this one makes a point of being extremely low cost. The pcDuino combines an arduino and PC components and has various flavors including USB ports. The CHIP computer is a $9 SBC that hasn't started fully shipping  yet, but it's another low cost, low power SBC sure to catch your eye.  They should start taking regular orders in the fall if I recall correctly.   SBCs all have slightly different features, which is good and bad.  I have come across a blog that keeps up with all sorts of little devices called Liliputing.  You could scroll through it and see if there are any other devices which might suit your tastes.  EDIT  Mark mentioned community support.  I've seen some grumblings in the FOSS communities that people don't understand the allure of the Raspberry Pi, because there are more powerful, more feature rich alternatives.  Keep in mind that while the community is large, a good chunk of it are n00bs asking the same questions over and over again presumably getting stuck on known issues.  Those known issues can be with the OS, the board, or while they are trying to realign the squishy parts to wrap their squishy part around the concept of Linux and/or Linux around the Pi.  My point is that a community of problems is not a beneficial community to the newcomer.  I'm a newcomer, and this is my gripe.  Also, I imagine that a lot fo Raspberry Pi How tos will work on other similar SBCs.
It seems this laptop would match your needs, doesn't it?   Asus ROG G501VW-FY031T PC Portable Gamer 15.6" Full HD (sorry, it's a link to the French amazon website, but I'm sure you'll find it easily on whatever your country is)   It features :   A core i7 processor (With "only" 2.6 Ghz of frequency, but I'm not sure it will make a difference in the games). 16 Gb RAM 128 Gb SSD for the OS, and 1Tb HDD for the storage. A GeForce GTX960M graphics card with 4Gb RAM (And, according to my researches, is equipped with DDR5) Equipped with wifi and bluetooth 3 USB3 ports (and no USB2 port)   I'm wondering about your question for USB 2.0,though. Isn't USB 3 meant to be retro compatible?   As for the processor frequency, I don't think it will make a difference in a gaming configuration (The graphics card makes the difference and is not limited by the frequency of the processor).  I don't know if it can make a slight difference for video editing. After some researches, that's the number of cores of your processor (The one in this configuration has 4) that could matter, depending on your software, of course.
If you are looking for laptop for gaming you should look for machine with best GPU. On newegg in this price range the best solution will be:  ASUS ROG G751JY-WH71 $1600 most important features:   i7 4th generation CPU  GeForce GTX 980M SSD 128 GB 16 GB DDR3 RAM   In your price range it will be best solution because of GTX 980M GPU. It is the most important part for gaming in laptops. The rest will also meet your requirements. It has no USB 2.0 port but USB 3.0 is backward compatible so you can use one of USB 3.0 slots for USB 2.0 devices.    If you are from Croatia like your profile says, it will be a little harder. I checked that â‚¬1500 is around 11500 Kn so I looked for laptop which meets your requirements in Croatian shops (I'm not familiar with Croatian market it would be easier if you provide some "good croatian shops url's") and I found:  Acer ASPIRE G9-591-73PJ Predator 15 - 11000 Kn on ekupi.hr:  Pros:   6th generation i7 CPU (6700HQ) 8 GB RAM DDR4 (it is enough for gaming) GeForce GTX970M (worse than ASUS but should be enough for most of new games)   Cons:   no SSD drive no operating system   It is much worse than ASUS but it's best solution which I could find on Croatian websites. I would look for something with GTX 980M if it's possible in this price range in Croatia. If you provide me with url's of "good" Croatian shops with laptops I will look what you can find there.
I have a LEPA MaxBron in my current machine which powers two nVidia boards. I've been very happy with it's performance.  It has a 6+2 set of connectors. This allows you to fit both the 6 and 8 pin power connectors. If you don't need the full 8 pins, the last two can be detached and don't need to be plugged in.    On top of this, it is fully modular, so you only need to plug in the power lines you need. This saves you trouble with wiring and improves airflow in the machine.    The 800W version of this power supply costs less than $100.   A few other features that are listed that may help your decision (from NewEgg):   80 PLUS BRONZE certified with over 88% efficiency  6+2P PCI-E connector supplied supporting extreme graphic cards Extended CPU connector cable to 23.6" (60cm) facilitates installation with bottom-mounted PSU chassis Anti3s Q-Brick design protects power supply from shock, static electricity, and slip
Undoubtedly the intel cpu. Benchmarks don't lie and I'm positive even that since 4th gen Haswell i5's intel has been significantly outperforming even the 8350, let alone the 8320. I'd also check out some of nVidias GPUs if you haven't already
A word of caution: you've got a Dell.  Dell is known for using non-standard pinouts on their power supplies, so if possible, check the documentation before plugging anything in.  That said, I think the technical name for what you're looking for is an EPS-to-PCIe cable, such as this Y-cable from Newegg.  Yes, it's a Y-splitter rather than a straight-through cable, but the keying pattern matches what's in your picture.
See the following articles from Phoronix:   30-Way Graphics Card Comparison On Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS 15-Way AMD/NVIDIA Graphics Card Comparison For 4K Linux Gaming The Best, Most Efficient Graphics Cards For 1080p Linux Gamers     In fact there are a dozen more articles comparing video cards on Phoronix, and you can use that to decide how much you want to spend for how much performance.  Also visit OpenBenchmarking.org.  In conclusion I recommend the Geforce GTX 970 because it offers the best price for the performance levels.  The faster cards are $100+ more and in the best case you get 10 fps more.  You wanted the 970 anyway for the Oculus Rift.  Currently the 970 is about $320-$350 on newegg.
I know this may be a little late, but I do know of one potential option. I couldn't find an adapter like what you describe (I was looking for the DisplayPort equivalent of this), but they do make HDMI source switchers with automatic input select, for example this one from A-Tech:    It has a select button but also will automatically select inputs if only one is connected.  Then, to one input, connect a DisplayPort -> HDMI conversion cable. To the other, connect a Mini DisplayPort -> HDMI cable. Leave the cable ends hanging out in the open for users to see, and let them pick.  Another thing you could do, although it might be slightly more complicated for users, is use a DisplayPort -> HDMI cable. Leave it exposed. Then get a slim Mini DisplayPort -> Display Port adapter and tie it to the end of the cable with a little string. Users with mini DP can use it if they need it.
I found this on a forum.     i was using OpenELEC 5.0.5 for RPi1 on my old RPi1B+ and CEC was   working well on my TV. today, i just received my new RPi2 and i   installed OpenELEC 5.0.5 for RPi2. also here CEC is working well   Several people have report being able to do this with a raspberry pi 2.  The device is $35 and you will need a 5v power supply,SD card, usb wifi adapter.  The raspberry pi 3 has a built-in wifi adapter if you go with that model.  The rest you would have to research on the exact details of how.  Regarding the bonus points, Raspberry Pi, all versions, run linux and therefore support apache.  You can add a certificate from the letsencrypt project and setup a login screen.
Your best bet is one of the Rasbperry PI 2 or 3 is $35 The PI 3 does actually have built-in wifi, but no WPS button or activity leds.  They both have a RJ45 for hard wiring with activity leds.  You need a 5V adapter,SD card, USB wifi adapter and shipping and handling will bring the cost up a bit more.  Give up on the WPS and wifi activity leds and save $10-$20. You can then get a USB dongle if you really need a WPS dongle and wifi activity leds.
You might be able to use something these, feedthru RCA adapters with a side connector:    http://www.aliexpress.com/item/10PCS-RCA-adapter-RCA-Male-to-female-to-Female-M-F-F-Connector-Adapter-Audio-3/32469466648.html?spm=2114.40010308.4.167.2LWvQi  http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/2pcs-Audio-Right-Angle-RCA-Copper-Adapter-Splitter-1-Male-to-2-Female-Gold-Tone-/191495690255  Daisy chain the barrels and add extension cables from the side connectors.
I don't believe there are any phones with your specifications under $199. Here is my recommendation:  The Honor 5X - $199     Android 5.1   Dual camera (13MP back)   2GB RAM   Compatible with both AT&T and T-Mobile sim cards (This also means StraightTalk)   Full 1080p HD 5.5" multitouch screen   Easily rootable (unlockable bootloader)   MicroSD card slot   16GB internal storage
You could buy a fanless Chromebook and install linux yourself.  It shouldn't be that difficult if you have much Linux experience, which you probably do if you only want it for the command line.
I find this one fits most of your requirements.  AT&T GoPhone - ZTE Zmax 2 4G with 16GB Memory No-Contract Cell Phone - Black ($99.99 + free shipping @ best buy)  1.2GHz processor with 2GB of RAM  (Snapdragon 410, 4 x A53 @ 1.2 GHz)  Delivers outstanding overall performance for opening and running applications, flipping through menus, running home screens and more.  Android 5.1 Lollipop OS  New colors and typography, new ways to control when and how you receive messages, and new security features, including Android Smart Lock, which secures your phone by pairing it with a trusted smartwatch or other device.  5.5" touch-screen display  (720p LCD)  Large screen makes it easy to navigate pages and watch videos.  8.0MP rear-facing camera  Snap photos of memorable moments while you're on the go. Also includes a 2.0MP front-facing camera for video chatting and taking selfies.  16GB internal memory  Offers plenty of storage space for music, photos, contacts and more.

addonics has introduced its Network Attached Storage (NAS) adapter, which is a $55 device that lets you plug a USB-powered external drive in one end and then connect an Ethernet cable to the other end that runs to your router.  http://www.zdnet.com/article/turn-external-hard-drives-into-network-storage-via-usb-with-addonics-nas-adapter/#!  http://www.addonics.com/products/nas40esu.php
After checking specification of your motherboard (from this link) I checked that you have one PCI-E connector which will support PCI-E Solid State Drive.   You have two possible solutions:  Buy M2 to PCIe adapter:   Addonics M.2 PCIe SSD Adapter X110 / $30 in their shop   Buy new SSD drive:   Kingston HyperX Predator 240GB (with HHHL Adapter) -> $180 on newegg.com Plextor Lite on M6e 256GB -> $190 on Amazon.com   I would reccommend to buy Addonics adapter it is cheaper and has good reviews.    EDIT:  If you will mount only one SSD you won't need additional power and sata cable (screen below):  Digging deeper I found two other Addonics adapters which have slot for only one SSD drive and no additional connectors (but only one can fit your SSD, because second one can only fit up to 80 mm M2 cards):   ADM2NVMPX4 $19 on their website
It seems that the best way to find a compatible Samsung TV is to check the firmware version on the Samsung Support pages. You can check that the downloadable firmware for that TV set is above 1400.  As a reasonable answer to this question, we found this device:  Samsung UE32J5550 80 cm  At a price of 327 Euros at the time of writing.  Small enough to fit on my desk, and cheap enough to please the boss.
EDIT: Another official Cherry MX Blue RGB option has become available recently, the Cooler Master MasterKeys Pro L/S. This keyboard is not exactly new, but I ignored it for some time after the Cherry MX Blue versions were originally delayed. The keyboard is currently out and available for anyone looking at options besides the Corsair keyboard.  EDIT: Since I first wrote this answer, Corsair has surprisingly brought back the K70 RGB in Cherry MX Blue switches. They were available on Amazon a few days ago, but quickly sold out. Unfortunately, it seems these aren't going to be restocked, meaning the Strafe RGB is likely the best option for Cherry MX Blue.  The Corsair Strafe RGB is available in Cherry MX Blue switches, and is a great option if you cannot wait for the K70 RGB Blue. The reviews for this keyboard have improved over the last few months, and the one I tried had no problems.  One of the previous answers mentioned the G.Skill KM780 keyboard, and the KM780R RGB is now available for preorder, unless Amazon is lying to us. The RGB version of this keyboard probably will never be available for Cherry MX Blue switches. The Amazon pages for the KM780R MX Blue RGB no longer exist.  There is also the Poseidon Z RGB keyboard, which is relatively cheap for an RGB keyboard. This keyboard does NOT have genuine Cherry MX switches (Kalih Blue), and I would only buy this as a last option, because some complain about the switches breaking after awhile of use.
I'll keep this as short and as on point as possible: Get the Samsung Galaxy S4 because it is a     great android phone with awesome specs, but in a tight budget of under   $180(may go a little over).       Typically $130-180 unlocked second hand, $150 on a quick amazon search for Straight Talk. New for $208.  Apparently $150 new at Walmart for Verizon.    It satisfies all of the following:     Here is a list of things I want it to include:         compatible with micro SD card   uses android OS   a good camera(about 13mp camera) 1080p@30fps w/ flash and auto-focus   Camera on both sides   Resolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels (will go with a lower if price and other specs make up for it)   multi-touch is a must   Screen Size: about 4.7-5.2 in.   At least 2gb of ram   Rootable (unlocked bootloader would be a bonus) - plenty of help available for this popular phone e.g. xda developers forums   compatible with Straight Talk       and also has super-amoled screen.  Obviously hard to say what 6 hours non-stop use is, but according to specs: stand-by up to 350 hrs (3G), talk time up to 11 hrs (3G) and music play up to 69 hrs. It does have a removable battery so for an $10-15 extra you can get an official Samsung battery and effectively double the battery life. You're probably better off getting an official Samsung Adaptive Fast Charger in a bricks and mortar store.  Don't really understand what you mean by     An led notification bar   Hope that helps.      Addendum (so the comments section doesn't get too lengthy):  With the required spec changes from 2GB RAM to 3GB, no upper limit on screen size and assuming this     but in a tight budget of under $180(may go a little over).    means ~10% over, so ~$200, it looks like the Samsung Note 3 (obviously 2nd hand) and the Xiamoi Mi4 (non-LTE, $160) are your only candidates.  If you stretch again by $20 you can find the Xiamoi Note 3.  For me personally, if it was taking me a long time to find a Samsung Note 3 that I really liked, I'd stretch out the budget and get the Xiamoi Note 3 to end the wait.
There's a test of the Medion on this site:  http://www.notebookcheck.com/Test-Medion-Erazer-X7843-Notebook.154482.0.html  Just use Google Translate or similar and you'll see that it is even tested against the G752VT. Nobody can tell you whether one thing is worth it or not, but the test gives you pretty much all the information you need to make your own decision (screen, noise, temperatures etc. are all in the test)  Edit: The site says that the screen is good, the performance is very high, the input devices are "proper" (my German isn't great, so that is the best translation I can give) and the negatives are that the CPU and GPU are soldered on and that the laptop throttles (turns down clocks/performance) on battery power.
The HP Stream 13 might be a good option.  I've run Fedora on the older, bay trail 11-inch model and it works out of the box. You may need to turn off secure boot for some distros. Otherwise? Dual core Celeron processor (mine was bay trail but there's a newer model), fanless, roughly 6-hour battery life, 32GB eMMC for storage, and it's entirely silent.
Just to add one possibility that I found after posting this question:  an ideal laptop would be:   device called NexDock combined with some IntelStick / Raspberry Pi / BeagleBoard   But there have been similar startup projects before, and they did not succeeded.  I hope that NexDock will (but it is critical, the current status is 52% with only one month left).
Have you considered biometric USB drives, such as the Imation Defender F200 Biometric, it may be a little slow, but supports passwords, fingerprint scanning, or both. There is a review of it: Imation Defender F200 Biometric Flash Drive Review: Secure but Slow.  Or there is the Iron Key Personal D200, which does not specifically have a password enabled write protect, but it is pretty damn secure, nevertheless. Here is a, somewhat out of date, review: IronKey Personal D200.    As an aside, have you seen George Bailey's answer to Is there such thing as a password enforced write protected flash drive?:     (The write protect switch on the model drive I have used is discrete like a reset button, you need to stick a pen or something into the slot in order to reach the switch and flip it)      The best solution I have so far - that still satisfies the requirement that no malicious files be downloaded by the user - is to get a flash drive that has a physical write protect switch, and apply a coating that will harden. (similar coats are on the market for covering tool handles, such as wrenches)      If the hacker has physical access, I see this setup as having 2 possible outcomes         the tamper would be evident to the user (broken seal), or   after tamper is complete, a new coat of similar color would have to be applied by the hacker.      Again while not password protected, it does get around the issue that you mention in your comment hardware switch is not good because everybody could turn it on or off.
The original Hi-Fi Wi-Fi speaker company, Sonos, seems to be your fit. They have three product lines that are fully inter-operable with each other; in order of increasing quality (and obviously price): the Play 1, 3 and 5 at $200, $300 and $500 respectively.   Despite the $50 budget breach per speaker, I include the Play 5 because you'll need at least one (or the CONNECT or the CONNECT AMP) for full source computer (Apple) audio (i.e. sources from non-Sonos compatible streaming apps). The Play 5 is also the only one with an AUX, the biggest speaker and as I mentioned the speakers are fully inter-operable, so you can mix and match.  As long as you have at least one Play 5/CONNECT/CONNECT AMP connected to an AirPort Express, all models exceed your critical requirements:     Critical features:      The Wireless speakers I am looking for should be able to source    computer audio, and let me select where to play it at any time (yes for Apple devices via AirPlay):         Play one of the speakers, or...   Both speakers at the same time (2 speakers be can linked for great stereo output)         additional speakers can all play at the same time   all speakers can be divided and grouped individually into zones playing different music. Note: if using AirPlay, group functions are still available, however AirPlay is treated by Sonas a single source-so same music only in that group            Additionally, I would like them to:      Support AirPlay streaming from iOS devices   And satisfy almost all optional features:        Support direct streaming from services like Spotify (with Spotify premium-yes), Soundcloud (not sure-but if it plays through AirPlay then yes)   Allow Aux Line-In or equivalent (Play 5 only)    Manufacturer also provides "bridge" unit that can connect ordinary line-in speakers to the Wi-Fi system      Now in contrast to previous Sonos speakers, the latest ones connect directly to your Wi-Fi and don't require the old $50 bridge. Assuming a total budget of $900 for any 2 speakers and that you have an AirPort Express (additional $100 if you don't), to stay within it you could get (in order of preference):    (1 x Play 5) + (1 x Play 3) = $800 (1 x Connect) + (1 x Play 3) + (1 x Play 1) = $850   I'd go with option 1 myself because it's more than enough my for average (European) place. All the Plays sound amazing, but obviously the Play 5 really fills the room, so put plug that in your bigger/more frequented room with the AirPort Express next to it. If you don't have an AirPort Express you can get one and still be in your $900 budget.   If you want to fill a large house, stretch the budget and get 2 Play 5s. Or buy 1 Play 5, test it and decide on another or a Play 3. The main lady will try, but she'll never keep you down.
You're absolutely right-it is very very hard to find the right keyboard for everything, but if you want to switch between 3 bluetooth devices at the press of a key in the dark and don't need a full size keyboard, the Logitech K810 seems to be the only one. Tried it in store and was very happy with the build quality but it goes for ~â‚¬100.  Another option for fast Bluetooth switching between 3 devices is the Logitech K480. The keyboard is not illuminated but has a dock to place phones and tablets which is very handy. Again tried it in store and was happy with quality, real shame it's not illuminated. ~â‚¬50-55.  For a basic multiple Bluetooth connected keyboard with no illumination or dock there's the Logitech K 380 for â‚¬35-40. Haven't physically touched this.  Hope the K810 is what you're looking for.
I have used Devolo dLAN 200AVs extensively in my UK home for about five years now, and they are great.     I have about six of them, all single Ethernet port (multiport versions, which three Ethernet ports, are available). I have not found this to be a problem, because I have switches/hubs in most rooms, anyway.   They have UK plugs, not US plugs, but none of my dLAN 200 AV devices are pass though (i.e. you can plug a mains device into them), so I needed either use an extension cable with a 4 or 6 way plug board attached, or where I had dual sockets in the wall, I just sacrificed an outlet.  The benefit of pass through devices, is that they contain noise suppression circuitry inside them, to help counter any noisy devices, or power on spikes that may be generated by adjacent devices that may also be plugged in to the plug boards. Devolo actually recommend that the dLANs are not plugged in to plug boards, and that they should only be plugged in at the wall, due to signal degradation. However, I personally, have not experienced many problems, mine all work fine.  I recently added two 500 dLAN AV Plus devices, which do have pass through.    I use these for a higher speed connection from my media server, in my garage, to my lounge, where the XBMC is, and I can stream videos just fine. They also are compatible with the existing 200AVs, so now every room is connected.  They even come with a remote admin tool, the dLAN Cockpit, that works on OS X (as well as WinTel machines). Also available are Wi-Fi extenders, which act in the same way as the Ethernet variants, but pump out Wi-Fi instead.  Also, the wiring in my house is about 50 years old, and no problems have arisen because of that. They can get quite warm, but even after having them plugged in for 4 years solidly, that has not been an issue.  I can not recommend these highly enough.  Also, I purchased all of them, secondhand, on eBay for around Â£10 each for the 200AVs and Â£20 for the 500s. Just wait for someone selling a bulk lot because they are upgrading (i.e. from 200 to 500, so they are selling off the 200s cheaply).
There are sites like cpuboss (for comparing CPUs) and gpuboss (for comparing GPUs) where you can compare your components with other components you are interested in and see reviews, benchmarks and differences. Here i'm comparing:   your CPU with FX-8320 and FX-8320 with i5-6500   I think that going with Intel is overall a more valuable change and choice.
Does it make sense to store relatively large sample libraries in a remote location?   It makes sense, but it's not at all beneficial. If you're going to be pulling samples into your project fairly often, you'll be much better off storing them locally so you only have to depend on drive connection transfer rates.     Would it be smarter to get a network switch to enable double LAN ports?   Like you said, this wouldn't matter at all if your computer is bottlenecking the network connection with one LAN port.     What's most future-proof solution given that I may upgrade my computer to USB-C and/or Thunderbolt 3 within 1-2 years?   The two options you're choosing from aren't desirable if you're focusing on future-proofing. Both will become completely outdated in 1-2 years because of the USB 2 and HDD technologies.       External SSD with USB 2 or external HDD with Thunderbolt 1?   Transfer rate  Taking into account the other questions, an HDD with Thunderbolt will do you well because you could connect several of these to a Thunderbolt hub and have little to no bottlenecking. Thunderbolt is rated at 1250MB/s per channel (but usually hits around 500MB/s) while HDD read speeds average around 120MB/s. This allows for a lot of room to expand your storage options later on. With an SSD-USB 2 setup, you have a connection speed of 60MB/s bottlenecking an average read speed of >400MB/s... Not too great.  Cost  Since you're looking for at least 0.5-1TB of storage space, choosing the SSD route will skyrocket the price very easily. A 1TB SSD will instantly put you over budget while a 1TB HDD won't even put you over half your budget. Also, since you're considering the future, it's better to spend less so you can potentially upgrade to a newer technology later on. You might find a good deal on an SSD with Thunderbolt for example.  Availability  Both options are fairly uncommon because USB 2 is being quickly phased out as a drive connection type and Thunderbolt on a hard drive is a mix of very old and very new technologies. Don't expect a small price tag on anything amazing.  Recommendation  G-Technology G-DRIVE Mobile 1TB 7200RPM 1xThunderbolt/1xUSB 3.0 (USD $190)   Enough space for large sample libraries Easy to move around and manage Comes with Thunderbolt and USB cables Transfer rate: up to 136MB/s   A quality solution overall. But, again, you don't have too many options here given your price constraint. There are better products out there that sit outside your budget.
I would suggest a $9.95 Dynex DXHUB23 4-Port USB Hub. Failing that, you could employ a USB 2.0 active repeater cable. These abound aplenty, just have a search on google. For example, for $14.95, on Amazon, there is the PTC Premium 33ft / 10 Meter USB 2.0 Active Repeater / Extension Cable:    If you really want to extend a long way (20m) then you could employ the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed Active Extension Repeater Cable (A-A M/F), 20M (65-ft.)
The best mouse that I have ever bought, in fact the only mouse that I have ever bought (as I usually get mine from corporate throw outs), was a mouse made by NUBWO. It is a Nubwo Phelan NM-18:    Now I purchased this is Thailand, so I am not sure if they are widely available in the West, although they are designed in the USA. It cost me B$180, or $4, and it was not a copy or clone. It is a beautiful looking thing, and very comfortable to hold. It also has a plethora (well, a couple) of side buttons, which worked well (i.e. they weren't ignored) on an OS X machine (I have never used the mouse on a WinTel machine).  It also has a small resolution button that can cycle through four different pre-set speeds, 400, 800, 1600 and 2400 DPI, which I found to be very useful (when drawing technical designs), after having initially scoffed at it.  In addition, it has a colourful light display in the top, which looks cool, although it could be distracting, if working with the lights out.
English is not my native language so please be patient.  Your requeriments doesn't go with your budget, so you'll have to drop some requeriments, especially for non chinese brands.

Powering USB devices with solar is pretty easy, powering laptops is much harder. You really see the difference in power needs when you are trying to charge them yourself like this.  I'm based in a country with an unreliable power supply but good sun with a setup that can keep my portable PC charged for about 7-8 hours a day without going to too much trouble. While the exact product I use costs more than your $200 budget, I'm assuming you won't be putting in a full day's work while camping, and there's a lower-power option that should give you a few hours laptop use and a charged USB device on a sunny day that is within your budget.    < $200 option  Poweradd 40 watt Solar Charger, currently $159.99 (it says its on sale from $499.99 but I'm skeptical, there was a similar discount in June last year when I bought my 60 watt).      I recommend PowerAdd's panels because they're high efficiency, very portable, durable, and have some basic voltage control built in, at 18 volts which is suitable for most laptops and battery packs, with optional USB output too straight from the panel. They have both DC output (for a laptop or battery pack) and USB output, and can charge both at once (though obviously both will charge slower). Unlike most regular solar panels (not counting expensive kits like GoalZero's) they're explicitly designed with this kind of use in mind, and come with a variety of laptop and USB device adapters (basically everything except Apple adaptors which need to be bought separately). The 60W even comes with a jump lead and can jumpstart a car (though it looks like the 40W doesn't).  I've been using the larger ($259) 60 watt version almost daily for nearly a year now. It's very portable - folds down to the size of a hardback novel, and weighs about the same.  It's sturdy, too, and flexible, with a bit of give and bend, and a waterproof canvas. It's survived a tropical rainy season (I kept it out of direct heavy rain but it took plenty of splashes and humidity, and some light rain) and a very dusty atmosphere. The 40 watt will be even more portable, and looks just as sturdy.   There's a bit of an art to setting it up such that it points the right way and also keeps whatever you're charging in the shade - I recommend something like washing line or (what I use) bungey cords with carabiner clips.  Update: the solar market is fast moving and it was over 6 months ago I first looked into this, and since then several new products have appeared that seem to offer the same power and features as the 60W version at the price of the 40W version, from KingSolar (15V), Suaoki (18V) and ALLPOWERS (18V). I know from direct experience that the 60W PowerAdd I use is good, if these are as reliable, they're great value. 40W should be enough for occasional use while camping, 60W will easily be more than enough in an sunny location.    I've not used the 40 watt, but here are some typical real-world outputs from my 60 watt, with an estimated one third reduction applied:   Perfect conditions, 11am-4pm, pointing directly at the sun, no cloud, sunny day: you can get nearly the maximum output. For me, it's the same as a good mains charger (over 3 amps). The 40 watt pointed up and slightly to the north/south depending on hemisphere should still average around 2 amps for about 5 hours a day since you've got complete freedom in where you place it, which should be enough to fully charge or nearly fully charge most laptops. You can also charge a USB device at the same time which would make the laptop charging comparable to the bullet below. Any one of light cloud, imperfect angle, or charging a USB device at the same time: This is typical for me since I'm limited in where on my building I can put the thing, so it's typically about 25 degrees off the ideal angle, and typically gets something like 18V / 2.1A during appropriate peak hours (roughly 11AM-4PM) which is comparable to some older laptop chargers. You should get something like 18V / 1.4A which is easily enough to get a few hours' use out of a laptop each day. Any two of the above: This knocks it down to something like 18V / 1.4A which is easily enough for a few hours a day but is definitely very noticeably slower than even a very old laptop from the mains. For the 40W it should manage to sustain 18V but will be slow. Probably charges at a similar speed, or slightly slower than, a laptop uses power while on. Fully in shade or overcast, summer daytime: For example, on a morning when the sun is on the wrong side of the building, or when the sun's behind not-heavy cloud but it's either summer or you're in the tropics. I usually get 15V / 0.3A which is enough to charge slowly but slower than the laptop uses the power. A day like this might give an hour or two's power. For the 40 W it might not charge at all, but it should still charge USB at a respectable speed. Heavy cloud, or indirect sunlight on a somewhat cloudy day: the 60 W can usually manage enough to slow-charge USB (less than 1 amp with the 5 volt USB, or enough to recharge a partially depleted smartphone in a day). I'd expect the 40W to either not do anything, or maybe manage an hour's worth of phone use in a day.     Important consideration: the voltage input range of your laptop battery. First, I'm assuming it's 18V input. It might also be very fussy about its minimum voltage, in which case it'd probably not charge reliably except for in the top two bullet conditions.   For this reason, and for versatility, I never charge my computer directly and instead connect the panel to a battery pack, but direct charging might work better for some laptops. My battery packs don't like charging and discharging at the same time, so I own two, since I'm keeping my computer topped up from one while working during daylight hours while the other is charging, but assuming you're doing outdoors activities during daylight then whatever one does with a laptop while camping after dark, one will be enough for you.   I use Intocircuit 26000mAh which have a pretty decent 15V-19V input range, and are portable (same size as a paperback book, similar weight to a full water bottle) but they cost $99.99 (again, "discounted" from $299.999 but I've never seen them not so discounted) which would exceed your budget. They can also output at 12V and 15V as well as 19V, and as USB, making them very versatile. Weirdly, Anker sell something that is identical (seriously, identical) except smaller and lower capacity (20,000mAh). Weirdly, it's also the exact same price. Maybe you can find it cheaper somewhere making this plus the panel $200 or less.    If you're happy with only one or two hour's laptop use a day, and especially if you have more than one USB device, you could just connect a regular USB-only cheap battery pack with capacity around 7000-11000 mAh alongside the laptop, and it should recharge after about a day, enough to then charge two USB devices, while the laptop gains about an hour or two's charge.  (just be careful to keep everything except the solar panel out of the sun - this can be quite tricky)
Computer UPSs are optimized to provide high power levels for a short period of time, the idea being to bridge a brief flicker in the mains power, or let you shut down cleanly during an extended outage.  At low power draws, they are quite inefficient, wasting much of the battery's power as heat.  Your best bet is to build your own UPS from an inverter-charger and a marine/RV deep-cycle battery.  Something like this 600-watt inverter-charger ($400) plus a 60AH-80AH battery should work; given your low power draw and assuming you don't switch to battery power very often, you might even be able to get away with using an automotive battery.
The Samsung 840 Evo 250GB is priced at around $115 now. Samsung SSDs are known to be very reliable and I think that if the 850 Evo is out of your budget, the 840 Evo would be your best choice.  Comparison between 840 Evo and SanDisk Ultra II Plus here.  Comparison between 840 Evo and Intel 535 here.
Moving from HDD to any new SSD will be noticable, while the differences between particular SSD tend to be slight. I actually did the same (also ssd upgrade for programming) and just went with the cheapest SSD at the time (Kingston), because my laptop only supported SATA II (300 MB/s). If you have SATA III and want something premium, the Samsung 850 250 GB is your best bet imho, and you can get it for 360 zÅ‚ in poland: see allegro  See benchmarks:   Samsung 850 Pro VS 840 Evo Benchmark Test Samsung 850 pro vs 850 evo benchmark test (do not go with pro, it's for other use cases and you'd be overpaying) Also see SSD buyers guide from Linus
The Cable Matters 10 Meter(33ft) USB 3.0 Active Extension Cable is what you're looking for. It doesn't come with a power adapter, but unlike most USB repeaters, it can be used with one.   I've read that this repeater works great with this generic 5V adapter, which means you can have a fully powered USB hub at the end of the cable with no problems. These two will set you back about $40  I realize you were looking for a much shorter cable, but they don't really make 10' cables with power adapters.
Note: I saw you specified a Linux operating system and you can do that with my suggestion, but it'll give you greater flexibility.  I recommend to try out an Apple Mac mini & your Bluetooth Keyboard of choice. I am using a Mac mini myself, but have no experience with the features for blind people. I have repeatedly used some screen-guidance (VoiceOver) and know Apple does pay attention to these features, but apart from that I can only refer you to their specifications: http://www.apple.com/au/accessibility/osx/#vision   It's within your specified budget (although on the higher end). They have decent built-in audio speakers (but no microphone, which is ok, but not ideal, maybe). You can easily run them without a monitor (I do).   I think one advantage is that you could try out Mac OS X to see if it fits your needs. They also have a pretty good return policy, so if you don't like it, just return it.  You can also install any operating system you want - it's a bit more work for Linux, but it's manageable.  As I mentioned before it'll also allow you to switch between operating systems, if you ever see the need. Hope this helps.
If you want something really basic and cheap, I'll recommend a Raspberry Pi 3, which was recently released. It has built-in support for WLAN and Bluetooth 4.1, which is great for such a cheap device. You'll want to attach some external storage HD or get a pretty decent MicroSD card, depending on your storage needs. Western Digital just released a great 314 GB external hard drive that is made for the Raspberry Pi, but others will do just fine.  You could attach bluetooth speakers, like the Bose SoundLink Mini, which in my personal experience has amazing sound quality - and since you'll have plenty of left-over budget it might be a nice option as you probably want a high quality audio experience more than anything else.  You can install the default Raspbian (based on Debian) or other Linux variants on there.  It's not an x86 architecture, but uses an ARM processor (1.2 GHz quad-core). So, have a look around if that's something you are ok with. In my experience it'll work really well for all the tasks specified.  It's also really small and can be hidden out of the way in the corner really easily.

The best bud earphones I've ever used where those which came with the Nokia N8. The satisfy all of your primary requirements, except #4 (the warranty). However, I would imagine that you could pick some up second hand, quite cheaply, and so the warranty would not really be an issue.    As you can see from the photo, they will even satisfy your second optional requirement, as the controller is most useful. No LEDs though, I'm afraid.  The sound was excellent, they were hard wearing and rugged, and the volume control worked with my iPhone 5. I have gone through so many flimsy iPhone earbuds that I no longer even bother thinking about them.  I'm sure that you could find some on eBay at a most reasonable price.  The only down side is that if the connections in the jack go bust, they are a little bit hard to fix, but that applies to most bud earphones these days. Gone are the days of easily fixable 1/4" jacks.  As a side note, I ended up losing mine in a Bangkok nightclub, unfortunately.
High spec Haswells and Broadwells are going for absolute bargains right now and are excellent machines for most people that want very good gaming with normal work/social use cases.   But if you primarily want to game on your laptop and if you don't want to wait and can find the 6700HQ (or something else) with something like a GTX 970M and a Thunderbolt 3 port (preferably more), then go for it. That should last you 2 years by which time there'll be much more external desktop GPUs to upgrade to via Thunderbolt 3.      About a year ago there was a big explosion in interest about   Thunderbolt, partly because it offered the possibility of running   desktop-grade GPUs as an external plug-in to laptops and all kinds of   other cool stuff. Right now, I can't ascertain whether this has lead   to any tangible use cases or is likely to.   To give an example (for non-hardcore gamers), Acer will be releasing a dock which features an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M graphics card, two DisplayPorts, a HDMI port, three Type A USB 3.0 ports, a headphone jack and an Ethernet port. Expected to be about â‚¬300, likely to be tied to Acer laptops.  For serious desktop graphics cards, a number of enclosures are out now or just around the corner that take a full PCI-E x16 slotted card. Thunderbolt 3.0 doesn't nearly have the same bandwidth as PCI-E x16 and this does lead to a performance hit compared to a desktop (Asus say 1-5% fps hit for theirs); but a bit of perspective: you're running a desktop graphics card on your laptop :-O.  There's the Asus ROG XG Station, as in a YouTube link above, tied to Acer laptops. Likely to be GPU manufacturer agnostic.  Razer have Core, which is a docking station designed to enhance their ultrabook grade Blade Stealth, but is GPU and PC manufacturer agnostic. From what I gather, hot swap drivers drivers are built into the Core and load on the fly, unlike the other offerings where you'll have to power of your device to disconnect the external GPU. It has a built-in 500W power supply (supports a 350W GPU), four USB 3.0 ports and Ethernet port. Already shipping in the US for $500 (without a GPU), $400 with a Blade Stealth ($1000 starting). Expected to ship in April for Europe. This is the one I'm really excited about :-D.  AMD are working on XConnect (with Razer), intended to be at least PC manufacturer agnostic.  So if you get a Skylake gaming machine with Thunderbolt 3 soon, which typically last for 2 years, by then there'll be plenty more GPU and PC manufacturer agnostic enclosures around. If you go Haswell, although much cheaper now, you'll have to replace the whole machine at upgrade time.     I'm not even entirely sure, to be honest, whether you can even buy   non-Apple laptops with Thunderbolt ports   Thunderbolt 3 is no pricey passing technology like Thunderbolt 1 & 2 before it. Nor should it ever be thought of as an Apple feature like Thunderbolt 1 & 2. Major manufactures have already released laptops with Thunderbolt 3 for their higher priced offerings and only more will follow suit. Here are only some examples.
As suggested in the video link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJRh43flvQ8) passive speakers could be the solution. They usually come with basic audio wires and you would have to attach these to a 3.5mm audio jack yourself. They may also be called Cabinet or Bookshelf Loudspeaker.  Impedance of these speakers is very important to avoid creating an electrical short. The suggestion is 16 ohm with 8 ohm possibly also working, but it's not without risk from my understanding.  The speakers brand in that video is called: Apart and they have different product lines available: e.g. SDX / SDI / SDQ / Ovo  Another similar example would be JBL Control, but that appears to only have a 4 Ohm resistor, making it a bit of a risky choice I think. Another one is Audioengine P4 and you'll find plenty in any audio-hardware selling shop.  The main problem (for me) with these is the price and size. They are more higher end products, not exactly small (understandably so if you are looking for high quality sound). Naturally, they also don't come with a 3.5 mm audio jack.  I also found these: Pyle Home PCB4BK 200W 4 inch Mini Cube, which are not as pricy, have 8 Ohm impedance and good reviews. There are a bunch of those cube shaped speakers available.  Obviously, you can't use any of these with a digital audio output - well, you would have to put a FiiO converter in between, which will need power and make this sort of pointless.  Most out of the box solutions on the smaller side are called something like External Loudspeaker or Computer / Tablet / Laptop Portable Speaker. Strangely, these will generally require being charged and/or come USB/AC powered. Examples are: Logitech S150, XMI X-Mini II, Frisby FS-210NU, Earise AL-101, AmazonBasics Computer Speakers, etc.  Obviously, there are plenty of Bluetooth speakers available as well. Bose SoundLink Mini is one with decent sound that also has an analogue line-in, but these need recharging every 8 hours of use. They are mobile, though and you can use them anywhere around the house.  [DIY]  Ok, back to the passive speakers. They won't come with that 3.5mm audio jack, because people expect you to put an amplifier in front of them. If you want to do it yourself, there is something on instructables: http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-wire-a-speaker-to-35mm-jack/  Now, this won't always work as the results will highly depend on how much power your Audio-Out provides. People tried this with a raspberry Pi and there it didn't exactly work. A monitor Audio-Out may give you better results, though.
It took me a fair bit of Web searching to find the answer.   In the end, I finally hit upon the correct set of terms to enter into Google.  I did a Google search for [ plantronics m70 m90 vs | comparison | difference ].  The 21st search result was an Amazon.co.uk product-description page which included the information I sought.  On that page, reviewer Andrew Oakley writes:     Note that the only difference between the M90 and the M70 is that the M90 comes with a fancy charger cable that can charge two devices (headset & phone) at a time, wheras the M70 just comes with a standard charger cable. The M70 is mostly black with a thin white stripe along the edge; the M90 is entirely black. The M70 and M90 headsets are otherwise identical in all technical and physical respects, to the best of my research. Talk time, A2DP, BT3.0, spoken features, etc.: all identical.   An anonymous commenter adds:     Plantronics don't make it very clear about the difference between the two products. I'm certainly going to go for the M70. I even checked the manual on the Plantronics website. It groups the M25 & M55 in the same manual and mentions when there's a difference. The M70 & M90 have the same manual but the only difference seems to be this for the "What's in the box" section: *Contents may vary by product.
Your requirements don't appear to be very specific:   What OS (Windows, OS X, Linux, or other); Which platform (PC, Pi, Mobile device, mini PC, MCU); Which processor (Intel, ARM, Atmel); Which size (0.94" up to 14"); What resolution; Which input connectors (VGA, HDMI, DVI, USB) Most importantly - cost   So, I will assume that you are fishing for possible solutions.  There seem to be three simple options, depending on what, and how, you wish to want to achieve your objective:  Use a mobile device  As you say      I thought to create an app   assuming that you mean a mobile device (iOS or Andriod) app, then, depending on the actual size of display that you require, you could use a second hand, iPad, which are cheap and readily available on eBay. If an iPad is too big then an old version of an iPod (an iPhone would be over kill, unless you need a 3G connection to your server, which I doubt) would suffice. If the app is for Android, then a facsimile of an iPod/iPad would satisfy your needs, a second hand Galaxy Note or Tab, for example.  Use a small monitor  If you mean an application, rather than an app, for a PC based OS (OS X, Windows, or Linux) then taking your question at face value, the best (i.e., cheapest, smallest monitor), would be one of the monitors supplied by Lilliput, such as the 10" 859GL-80NP/C.  For cheapness, you could use an old, vintage, CRT based Apple Color 12" Monitor, which has a resolution of 512 x 384. You would require an adapter, from Apple's monitor connector to VGA, but these are easy enough to find. You may, nowadays, have trouble finding a video card that supports it though.  Use a Lapdock  A Motorola LapDock 100 has a small screen, and accepts HDMI, which is fine so long as your PC has a DVI or HDMI output. Granted it also comes with a keyboard, but it would be useful for testing purposes, and could be used in conjunction with a Raspberry Pi - known as a PiDock. A prefect testing ground for your project, assuming that you are using a Pi. If you are indeed planning on using a Pi, then I would suggest the Motorola Atrix LapDock is a better solution than the Lapdock 100 as it has more and better features. Avoid the Lapdock 500, even though it appears on paper to be more fully featured, as it has some odd quirks that make it difficult to use.  To my mind, this is your best option to prove your project, as it would only require a simple set of Python scripts to get it up and running, and should you, thereafter, want to cancel/scrap the project, you can use the Raspberry Pi and Lapdock for some other purpose, and hence save money.  Build a custom solution  If you only need to display five numeric characters then a monitor seems to be overkill, for both a cost and energy efficiency aspect.  Much less power hungry, and arguably more of an interesting project would be to create a custom solution, using an Arduino and a Wireless or Ethernet shield (with the appropriate sketch to query the server) and an LED display, be that a 0.94" OLED, or a set of five 6.5" seven segment displays, or anything in between (again depending upon your size requirements).    If you can hammer down your requirements to be more specific, I can edit my answer accordingly.
You can try the Dell Precision 15 5000 Series (5510). It comes with Windows 7 pre-installed with an option to upgrade to Windows 10. RAM upgradable to up to 32GB. Does not have a webcam or an Ethernet port. Only drawback is that it has 15.6" screen.  Dell also has couple of Latitudes that fit the requirements, however they have built-in webcams and Ethernet ports.
I'm currently running a asrock beebox as a home server and I'm pretty impressed - its a reasonable balance between most of the factors I'd find handy in a small home server.  Its tiny, smaller than the brix of any size, and while its a 'less powerful' N3150 braswell processor, its probably plenty for LAMP hosting (I've done it for less and I run VMs with KVM on this - even a full windows 10 install).  I picked up the full system with OS (which gives you a 32 gb mmc with windows installed) - I've installed linux on a 1tb hdd, but there's no reason you can't use this for a system drive or even swap. You can also add msata and a 2.5 inch drive, and in theory, possibly replace the m.2 wifi card with a suitable m.2 SSD. There's very few options that give you this much flexibility in storage options in such a small form factor.   That's not all though - it has 3 usb 3.0 slots and a proper type c port. It has DP and 2x HDMI, and I've tested the HDMI ports at 4K30. I need to test DP but I'm a bit lazy.   Another unique feature is you can load it up with 2 slots of ram - I've got mine with 2x4gb of ram but you can go up to 16gb  Its rediculously small, has low power use and is pretty darned inexpensive. The only place where it may fall short is in the processor speed - its got a low base clock speed (1.6ghz) and will ramp up to 2.08 as needed. Its not actually as powerful as a mac mini but its good enough for most work. I run a full desktop environment (KDE) + up to 2 virtual machines with little issue.   ~170 usd on amazon + ram and storage to taste, so it won't break the bank either.
I'd essentially mirror my answer here and build something around a X10SDV-6C+-TLN4F Xeon-D based system. Newegg has it for a hair under the grand including an embedded CPU, and unlike some other models, it has a cooling solution. This dosen't include the ram but it'll take standard DDR4, and up to 64 gb of non ECC stuff (or 128gb of Rdimm ram).  Lets talk about the nice things about this board.  Its an 8 core system, designed to run VMs, with a TDP of 45W.   Lan ports? 2x gig-e. 2x 10gig-e (should you need it).   Out of band management over IPMI. You can install the OS over lan.  One PCI x16, one M.2 slot, 6 sata 3 ports.  All in a mini ITX form factor.  You could go cheaper but I doubt you'd get all the same features. I've not actually gotten one, but I was seriously considering it at one point, when weighing my options for a home server.
How about a Dell Latitude E6420?  Webcam and mic are optional (I do not have them on mine), It is very cheap, I got mine for <Â£200 about 3 months ago, It has a 14" screen, It is ridiculously tough, all metal in the important places with a scratch resistant powder coat and water resistant keyboard, You can get an optional USB 3.0 module, It features HDMI and VGA out, It has a WiFi switch, It has native Windows 7 support, i3, i5 and i7 options available, I have 8gb RAM installed in mine, Google says 16gb is possible, I upgraded mine to a 512gb SSD with no problems and considering the price compared to your budget, I think a little out-of-the-box adjustment is reasonable.    It also has an Ethernet port and an EC and SD card reader (no micro SD).  I've owned this Dell for a few months and have had zero problems with it. I think you may have had bad luck with them in the past. Dell have good drivers and some good software but I will admit customer support is lacking..
You really should upgrade, minor upgrades just won't do. Right now you might not be doing any computationally heavy tasks, maybe a few scripts in Matlab, assemblies with only a few parts in Solidworks/Creo and writing up the reports. Your laptop may get those done but probably very slowly.   In the later years, you'll need to be running larger assemblies along with CFD, thermal and FEM simulations that can take a few hours. You'd also like to do these from home instead of staying late after lectures in the computer labs all the time. Your work (particularly solid modeling) will be much more interesting and fun on a better machine, you'll be dying to learn more! You'll want it to last a few years after college and I've factored that in too.   Spec wise what you're looking for is any laptop with all of the following:    a Skylake i7 12-16GB RAM with support for 32GB and access to slots 256GB ssd (preferably 500+GB) a Thunderbolt 3 port a mid range gaming graphics card for Solidworks, a GTX 960M will more than suffice  14+inch matte screen (preferably 15.6+inch) obviously Windows as a host OS   The above should easily get you through college and longer. But if you find that you really like designing and need to do even more complex assemblies, when the time comes you can upgrade to a desktop graphics card via the Thunderbolt 3 port. If you are trying to decide between specific machines, post them up here and the Exchange can help you out.  Be prepared to spend $1000-1500. That'll leave you ~$500 to buy student versions of Matlab, Solidworks, Creo, Office etc if you need to. Many laptop manufacturers have student discounts of 10-15%.  Treat yourself like a professional and you'll naturally start acting like one.
This looks promising: RENOGYÂ® Foldable Solar Suitcase Kit 100W Mono.      100 watt output Maximum Power Voltage (Vmp): 18.0V.  For an extra $20 there's an optional charge controller that can limit this to 12V, and they say in answers to questions that it's fine to charge things other than 12v lead acid batteries without using the charge controller, straight from the panel. Heaps of detailed positive reviews! A couple mention connection problems, but add that they had no problem fixing these Portable, includes its own stand At $240 USD, it's cheaper than my 60w panel was!   More details at Renogy's site. At 12kg and folding to the size of a large suitcase (Renogy's site has an illustration) it's portable enough for my needs (occasional house-to-house or air travel but not backpacking or camping).   Regarding waterproofing, they say:     The solar panels are fully waterproof (IP66 class), the controller is not.
Perhaps you could use a cheap tablet or smartphone with a streaming app?  You could also use a BananaPi with extra batteries, camera module and USB WiFi stick (or BananaPro with built-in WiFi). Batteries require some simple soldering.
Currently, Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 Gaming Laptop is going for $999 in Newegg. It has an i7 6700HQ, 16 GB DDR4 RAM, 1 TB HDD + 128 GB SSD, Full 15.6" IPS HD display and up to 5 hourse battery life.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834321438  Honestly, the configuration for this price is very good. Compared to some of the other laptops with similar price points, this one is much more powerful. It should be more than enough for programming. This laptop does not have an internal disk drive, however I don't believe that to be too much of a problem since external ones are available. The only con of this laptop that I think is worth considering (even though compared to all of the pros, I think is relatively insignificant) is that the hard drive is only 5400 rpm. The SSD will definitely speed things up, but you might want to consider this. All in all, I think it is a great laptop for the job.
This VGA to HDMI with audio adapter is what you are looking for. It costs a little more than you were hoping, but there aren't many of these things around, and it has a lot of good reviews.   $22.42   Converts VGA Source to HDMI Display   Supports Audio Function for HDMI Monitor and TV   Powered by USB Port   Cable Length: 8"
Yes, virtually all single beam projectors are active.  This is because passive polarization relies on pixel perfect alignment of the light to the polarization material (screen medium).  Active 3D however does not have that limitation as the glasses do not need polarization.  There are costly dual projection setups which can be used passively, but they are also difficult to align and maintain.  I prefer passive as well, but owning both types, I can say that active 3D has made advancements in the home.  I prefer DLP 3D projector glasses even to those sold for Samsung 3D TVs now.
If you have not come right as yet see if you can find yourself a pair of Steelseries Siberia Raw Prism's. They are a good price to performance headset and are also extremely comfortable, the only thing I do not like about them is they are plastic but I doubt you will be able to find a set as good as them for that price and if you look after them the plastic is strong enough to last. I see they go for $49 on Amazon at the moment.  http://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Siberia-Prism-Gaming-Headset/dp/B00O06ZN3O
There are a couple of things you could do....  Option 1:  VGA to HDMI Adapter  The cheapest one I found with relatively good ratings was (at the time of this post) $17 available on Amazon.  VGA being an analog signal and HDMI being digital, there's no getting around the fact that you have to convert the signal.  Note:  You will need to supply your own HDMI cable to go from the adapter to your TV    Option 2:  Upgrade Video Card to DVI and use a DVI to HDMI Cable  You said you had a desktop computer, so you could easily add (or replace) your existing video card with one that had a DVI connector.  These are selling for as low as $5.95 (at the time of this post) on eBay.  Keep in mind that this is going to be a used video adapter, but given the price constraints, I don't think this will be too much of an issue.  You can then use a DVI to HDMI cable to connect that video card to your TV.  Amazon has it for $6.95 (at the time of this post). Since DVI and HDMI are both digital, no digital to analog conversion is necessary      Unfortunately, there are no options that I could readily find for under the $10 limit.  The second option I proposed seems to be the cheapest, coming in at about $13 USD.
What you need is a firewall that that does packet inspection so that it can prevent IP spoofing.  Your Linksys BEFSX41 (assuming v2) "does" packet inspection and can prevent IP Spoofing (see data sheet).  That said, this router/firewall is from 2004 (over 12 years old) and as far as I can tell, there have been no updates to this particular model; meaning it isn't current to address current threats.      I recommend pfSense.  The beauty with this platform is that you can purchase a complete hardware appliance for as little as $300 or your can build your own if you have a spare PC laying around.  There are videos on YouTube that show you how you can do this.     Packet normalization - Description from the pf scrub documentation - "'Scrubbing' is the normalization of packets so there are no ambiguities in interpretation by the ultimate destination of the packet. The scrub directive also reassembles fragmented packets, protecting some operating systems from some forms of attack, and drops TCP packets that have invalid flag combinations."   Being a small business, I can appreciate trying to maximize your investment and getting the most value for a dollar.  I have recommended pfSense to many of my clients and I use it personally at both my office and at home.  I think you will find it more than capable to meet your needs.
Well, just like @Cfinley said, Nvidia is about to drop the Pascal Series. You're probably get the most bang for you buck with one of those, but since we don't have concrete prices/specs, it's mostly just speculation. If you want your GPU soon, I would recommend the 980 TI over 970 SLI. In my opinion, there are many benefits to the 980 ti.   Lower TDP. The 980 TI has a TDP of 250, whereas the 970 SLI has 290. SLI is not always supported. This varies from program to program and game to game, but a single card is more reliable.  Most benchmarks I can find show the 980 TI getting a higher framerate. Here's an article. I don't know how well this transfers when you're rendering rather than gaming, but I'd assume the one that's better for gaming is also better for rendering.
I would start with only systems that are "self contained", meaning they need no software or special drivers installed.  These units will be recognized as a standard mouse and the OS will use a standard HID driver.  There are 2 main technologies used in developing head controlled mice.  Accelerometer/Gyro based systems like eeZee Mouse Tracer and Headmaster are generally the FASTEST and MOST ACCURATE.  The camera based systems which track head or eye movement seem to be the most widely marketed, although often more expensive and somewhat less responsive; including: Accupoint, Camera Mouse, myGaze, ViVo Mouse, Eagle Eyes, Erica, Eye Gaze, Eye Guide, Eye Mouse, Quick Glance, PCEye, Vision Key.  Most reputable manufacturers have a demo or loaner program in order to "test drive" their products for little or no cost.  Each state has a lending library of Assistive Technology devices.  An old medical evaluation of head-controlled mice can be found under the title of "Efficacy of three head-pointing devices for a mouse emulation task".  My newbie status prevents me from including more than 2 links.
You can use motherboard with IntelÂ® P55 Express Chipset it is not listed in compatible devices list but people run this Xeon on this chipset without any problems.  I recommend to look for some used motherboards with this chipset on auction portal which you use in your country (or specify country where we should look for it).   I would recommend looking for motherboards like:   MSI P55-GD65 Gigabyte GA-P55-USB3 Asus P7P55D   But you can always look for other motherboards with IntelÂ® P55 Express Chipset
My suggestion is to put that CPU on eBay.  By the time you source the motherboard, memory, drives, case, etc. (not to mention the time to find the time required to source and assemble all the parts) you are going to be in for at least $500 or more.  Why not look for a workstation class machine like this Dell on eBay?  It has a newer Xenon CPU, is fully built and ready to go.  You can even further customize it to your hearts content and the asking price is $250.  I am not knocking system building by any means, I just found that unless you are building a custom gaming rig, there really is nothing more efficient and economical than getting a used server/workstation rather than trying to source EOL parts.
The market for this type of product is shrinking quite rapidly; the culprit being "the cloud" and virtualization.  Data centers are a thing of the past for small and mid-sized businesses so the need for economical data center products has all but evaporated.  This is why you can only find old PS/2 VGA products that meet your needs.  As for (reverse) KVMs that support the newer tech, you aren't going to find it.  Display's are intelligent and mice and keyboards are predominately wireless.  It's difficult enough to support a traditional setup of 1 keyboard/video/mouse to many computers, it is next to impossible to support a setup of 1 computer to many keyboards/video/mouse.  Why?  Well, what "profile" does the OS use when sending a signal to the display?  One moment it might be a Dell Ultrasharp monitor with Logitech mouse/keyboard and in another instance it's a Samsung monitor with a generic keyboard and Microsoft mouse.  See the problem?  However, you can overcome this by using KVM over IP, but it's expensive.  Since the KVM signal is now going over TCP/IP it can connect to any keyboard/video/mouse combination.  They even have options for audio and USB. Take a look at these from Avocent.  One thing to keep in mind is this is for datacenter use.  If you are expecting to be able to get high performance and high resolution from your video, it's simply not going to happen.  My solution:  Given that you are going between a shared wall....   Video Splitter You will need two of these for each pair of monitors Logitech wireless mice  You can have multiple input devices on your system, it's just logitech's unifying receiver makes things very easy. USB over CAT5 Extenders (if necessary)  You can use this if you want to hook a non-wireless USB mouse/keyboard to the remote desk.   With this you won't have to press a button or need software.  However, you should be aware that both systems will be live at the same time.
I used to be a fan of Bose until a friend told me about Sennheiser.  They started out making monitors (headphones) for the music industry geared toward musicians and then branched out.  I have these exact headphones and they sound phenomenal and they fit perfectly.   (Sennheiser CX200. )  Not only does it fit all your specifications, but it has a huge 2 year warranty (one of the reasons I forgot how to spell Bose).
There are quite a few options available to you, depending on how much comfort you want to have vs. how much money you want to spend.  1. There are a few do-it-yourself solutions as suggested by @filo  You can use a Raspberry Pi + Camera + USB Battery pack to setup something, but it requires some effort and it's not going to be the most easy-to-use option.  2. There are plenty of USB WiFi cameras available that would be suitable.  Same as with the former option, just add a large battery pack and you have a mobile solution. (Nest Cam / Dropcam Example: http://www.instructables.com/id/Dropcam-Unplugged/) The clear advantage is less trouble setting it all up, but it's still not the most user-friendly, if you really want to carry it around.  3. Build-in battery WiFi Cameras:   Logitech Circle http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/circle Netgear Arlo https://www.arlo.com/en-us/   These products have a build in Battery and are made to be used without any wires (until you have to recharge them).  You can read a comparative review on some of these options here: http://arijaycomet.com/2016/01/23/comparison-netgear-arlo-q-vs-nest-cam-vs-logi-circle-vs-samsung-smarthd-vs-d-link-dcs-2630l/  [ALTERNATIVE ANSWER]  If your sole use case is for that family member to see you - I don't understand why you would want to carry the camera around on your helmet in the first place?  I think it would make more sense to either just install a few simple WiFi camera (e.g. Nest Cam) around the house and have her look at those on a tablet. They will show where you are and even give her security, when you are not there.  Alternatively, any smartphone you may already own, can do exactly what you want. Just start a Skype / FaceTime / Hangout call and carry your phone around. Assuming you already own a smartphone - it would be the no-cost option. (Well, you need a viewing tablet / computer for her, but you need that in any case.)
I just check on Amazon for the ULM100USB. and in the Q&A someone from Behringer said that it works on Macs.  Have you contacted their customer service department?  Recommendation:  Given that their website and product brochure says that it's compatible with a Mac, you should stick with that product.  From their product brochure:    I would double check the specs, or clarify your question because everything I am finding says this works with OS X (and I can't see why it wouldn't).  As for bluetooth and WiFi  I seriously doubt that you are going to find a pro level mic that transmits over either of these technologies.   Why?  Bluetooth is limited to 30 feet and a PC/Mac will only work with one bluetooth audio device at a time.  This makes it rather impractical to develop a wireless mic system when you can only have 1 mic paired to 1 computer and you can't go any further than 30 feet  WiFi gets around the 30 foot limitation but the audio quality will be horrible.  WiFi is wireless IP which is packetized.  So forgetting about the DAC (digital audio conversion) that must be done, it will then take those digital signals and put them in packets, blast them out over the network to the receiving device, reassemble them, convert them back with another DAC then process them.    Shorter version of that?  Think VoIP.  It's really neat from time to time but it can get horrible quick the moment there is a traffic storm.  Why would any company build a product for which the quality will inherently be crap due to facts completely outside their control. The answer is...they won't.  The "radio based stuff" as you called it works off a 2.4Ghz channel which it dedicates to that particular mic.  This way you can have the range of 2.4Ghz and the high quality of a clear signal that it isn't in competition with other mics for bandwidth.
If found this soundbar on Amazon - The 5iveÂ® Bluetooth Soundbar    It's only 38cm, it has all USB, 3.5mm audio jack and bluetooth.  It has it's own power supply and is priced around $40 USD or $35 â‚¬  I think this should fit the bill quite nicely.
I am basing this on your statement:     Primarily I am going to be using VS 2015 (Visual Studio) and later   editions, so we can safely assume there is a lot of memory-hogging and   processor-crunching.   Also...     Portability: I am going to be travelling a fair bit around the   country, yes. But not frequently.   I would get a workstation class laptop like the Dell Precision line.  Personally, I have bought refurbished laptops and had excellent results.  I found this one on Amazon, the Precision M4600.  All of them lasting well past 3 years and none dying on me.  I just outgrew them.     Intel Quad Core i7 2860QM 2.50GHz Processor 15.6" 1920x1080 Full HD Anti-Glare LED Display nVidia Quadro Video Card with 2GB Dedicated RAM Memory Windows 7 Professional 64-bit operating system    It has a 1TB HDD, but you can upgrade to an SSD quite inexpensively a 1TB Samsung EVO is under $300 and a 250GB is under $90  There are optical bay drive conversion kits available for you to change out the DVD drive for another HDD as well.  This way you can get a smaller SSD for your OS and programs and a regular HDD for your "storage."
As has been said, Pascal is coming soon, and is expected to have greater performance increases than the Kepler to Maxwell transition (Pascal should be released to public around the end of Q2). However, I wouldn't dismiss multi GPU setups out of hand, though perhaps it makes more sense as a later upgrade.  Why multiple GPUs are better with Pascal:   Pascal Introduces NVlink, which can be used to connect GPUs even when the CPU does not support it as in the image below (image source)      Rendering generally scales well with multiple GPUs. SLI is not required.   (sources: iray benchmarks, VRED Nvidia article, Vray RT Nvidia article)   With the introduction of DirectX 12, Split Frame Rendering is making a comeback. Multiple GPU solutions with good game support can have comparable frametime latencies and also allows the graphics cards to not duplicate all the resources across the two memory pools.   Why you might opt for a single GPU anyway:   Upgradability. You could always drop in a second later. Third GPU scaling is way worse, though that might change with NVlink, a single GPU is still the better option in that respect. Support. It's annoying when sometimes SLI doesn't work for a game, and you're stuck with poor performance. You'd also need a slightly bigger PSU and case, because lower end cards are higher clocked, and two obviously take more space.   What you should also consider:  AMD's Polaris is also releasing around the same time, and is supposed to have competitive performance per watt. Of course, you might run into problems with vendor specific software, such as those using CUDA, but it goes both ways (well, slightly more in favor of Nvidia, owing to their market share), and AMD hardware generally have better OpenCL performance. If you're not worried about power consumption and you want your computer now, 2 R9 390s would be decently better performing than 2 GTX 970s at high resolutions.
I think you are making this overly complex.    I purchased a Kindle Fire for my 80 year old aunt and showed her how to use three apps on it.  Netflix, Skype and email.  The out of pocket cost was just over $50 including the case and a stand (so she could watch movies)  I positioned the icons for her so that they were the first things that were there when the device was turned on.  That was Christmas 2015.  I have yet to have a tech support call from her on how to use the device .  However, she has called everyone including her grandson in Guam using Skype - she on the Kindle and he on an XBox.  Now, this was a woman who got a free laptop from another nephew but the laptop ended up collecting dust because the moment something had to be updated or it generated an error, they had no idea what to do.  Sometimes, the simplest solution is the best solution.  I regularly get emails and Skype calls from her, but none have been to resolve a tech issue.  That $50 was well worth the price.
There's pretty few options that are cheaper than the rpi. Quite frankly, there's nothing with the same support and for the moment the same power as an rpi 3, at that sort of price range. Off the top of my head odroid's lower end stuff's at the same price point, and I've considered them (and ended up spending a fair bit more and getting a NUC, for other reasons).  They have nowhere near the same options for OSes but they have two models with the same price point and roughly similar performance. Unlike the RPI models, they have gigabit ethernet.   I'd take a look at the odroid c1+ or c2.   The c1+ has   Amlogic ARMÂ® CortexÂ®-A5(ARMv7) 1.5Ghz quad core CPUs  * Maliâ„¢-450 MP2 GPU (OpenGL ES 2.0/1.1 enabled for Linux and Android) * 1Gbyte DDR3 SDRAM * Gigabit Ethernet   And the c2 has  * Amlogic ARMÂ® CortexÂ®-A53(ARMv8) 2Ghz quad core CPUs  * Maliâ„¢-450 GPU (3 Pixel-processors + 2 Vertex shader processors) * 2Gbyte DDR3 SDRAM * Gigabit Ethernet * HDMI 2.0 4K/60Hz display * H.265 4K/60FPS and H.264 4K/30FPS capable VPU   And the c2 is getting released in april  Reviews seem positive, and the c1 compares well to a rpi2
I would like to add to what T.J.L. said (i completely agree with him). Software/MB raid is bad!!! Unfortunately for you, any solution that you choose that is going to be sufficient is going to be expensive.  So here are your choices as I see them: This card has some good recommendations: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816117153&Tpk=Intel%20RS2BL040&nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-VigLink2--na--na-_-na&cm_sp=&AID=10446076&PID=3821802&SID=imc5dvz3r0000a1700053  keep in mind its Intel so there should be no issues with setup. (or choose a similar card, i know they are expensive, but you get what you pay for) Its pretty much a carbon copy of an LSI card but with Intel firmware. You should get a UPS if you go this route!!!!!!  For a NAS I would recommend Synology DiskStation DS1515+  I have a DS216+ (I love it, a lot of features). It is easy to expand and you can easily add or upgrade drives in it.  Another option is to get a Synology DS1515+ or 1815+ and map a network drive to your PC. Now this is going to be a bit slower, but you can bridge all the ports on the NAS to work together to get you more throughput + a 1Gb switch or connection should work (no promises, you will need to test this for yourself). Be sure to get the "+" versions. the others are underpowered in my opinion.
I would recommend the gtx 980 TI.  Pros:   It is a geforce. It performs WAY better than your old card. Draws 250 W, so with your power supply, you should be able to handle it. Compatible with your motherboard, and your case. This card is 282mm, and your case advertises a maximum length of 295mm. Costs about 650 USD, which (according to google) is less than 600â‚¬.   Cons:   Very modern, definitely supports rendering. Probably supports rendering. It isn't officially listed on adobe's list of support GPUs, but it probably works anyway. You might have some tinkering/hacking to get it to work. Also, there are some benchmarks showing unsupported cards, including the standard GTX 980, working well.    As a side note, right now this is pretty much the best GPU on the market. The Titan X outperforms it, but is significantly more expensive. This card is a great choice for what you have described. If you want something a little bit cheaper, you could go with a regular GTX 980 which will save you about 100â‚¬.  If you're scared by this card not being supported, you could go with the GTX 780.  Pros:   It is officially supported. Some benchmarks show it outperforming the 980 TI, which is strange since it is significantly less powerful.   Cons:   Less powerful. Older. It was released in 2013. Half the VRAM. (3 GB vs 6 GB) Expensive for a card that is 2, almost 3 generations old.   Personally, I would still recommend the 980 TI. I don't think it's worth it to drop 600 on a 2-generation old card. Hopefully future versions of premier will officially support the newest cards better.
Alienware would be my recommendation will meet all your specs as standard besides the RAM and touchscreen and will meet the budget as well the last quote i got from them was below your upper limit but that was with a business discount. you also get extras like,   1 yr Next business day warranty which you can choose to extend. RGB configurable LED Keyboard.  awesome styling.  Interestingly enough you can also purchase a graphics adapter to add desktop grade graphics, Nice if you need extra power while at a desk.   Can't speak to Linux support i have in the past ran it on dell laptops without much issue.  all these details are available via the below link,   http://www.dell.com/au/p/alienware-17-r3/pd?ref=PD_OC  Alienware 17 inch $2,799.001 Powered by Intel Core i7-6700HQ Processor, Windows 10 Home, 8GB memory,  GTX 970M,  Full HD display,  1TB hard drive.
You might want to investigate the Thinkpad from Lenovo as well. W550, P50, P70... They are all high end machines and they have various options so that you can tailor the machine to your needs.  But the "killer" feature - for me - was the docking station (purchased separately) that gives the ability to move the laptop around while still having a "proper" screen, keyboard and mouse when you are sitting in your home office. The best of both worlds. While you didn't mention "docks", maybe this could fit all of your keyboard requirements if 90% of your work is done on a desk and not "on the go" (you can then purchase any keyboard and plug it to the dock, which is what I did with mine).  Support is great as well and professional (at least here in the UK) - and when I purchased mine, I got the extended warranty which was very cheap.  Also, the Lenovo laptops are fairly easy to open and there are lots of manuals in case you want/need to replace the components by yourself.  The bill can add up quite quickly at purchase if you go for the best machine, though.
I am assuming that you want to connect the Intel Compute Stick to something that you can view the output of the device, correct?  First off, you cannot connect it into the HDMI port of your MacBook Pro.  That's output only.  That's like trying to connect the HDMI out port on a DVD player to the HDMI port on a game console - it's not going to work.  What you need is a monitor with an HDMI port as an input.  Any monitor with an HDMI port will work.  If you want to capture the video, you need a video capture device.  The Elgato Gaming Video Capture products have been really good.
There is one company that I have seen that makes a pretty good product for this - Gefen's EXT-HD-MVSL-441.    They have a multi-view switcher that takes 4 HDMI inputs and scales them, sizes them and outputs them either full screeen or in a "windowed" layout on a single HDMI montor.
Have you tried eBay?  I bought a 2GB SSD for about $7 so I could build a pfSense router.  It was perfect for what I needed.  I also bought a 60GB HP SSD for $15.   There are plenty of drives (even new ones) for under $20.  It will just take some hunting.
You can find HDD's under $20 on newegg.com :   80 GB - WD800JD - $9.99 on newegg.com WL 160GB - $14.99 on newegg.com
I created e-ink display from Kindle DX device. Steps can be found on the internet, but due to their length I'm not going to reproduce them here. The point was to jailbreak Kindle DX, put a VNC viewer there and start a session.   advantage: used Kindle DX is relatively cheap to buy disadvantage: 9.7" Kindle screen often is too small for use as PC display; display always works in 16 shades mode so there is significant lag  Still good as a starter device or for testing by someone who is not sure whether e-ink display will help him or not.    Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â >> youtube search (reality check)    My friend just received Dasung PaperLike 13.3" e-ink USB display, from Chinese startup, also promoted in their Indiegogo campaign. Interesting and useful feature are 3 modes of display (16 shades, 5 shades, 2 shades) which differ by screen update speed.   advantage: first really usable device around; good screen size and sufficient resolution (1600Ã—1200); offers 2-color mode to eliminate problem with lagging disadvantage: price and limited availability (they are currently producing them in batches, you need to send the money and wait for next batch)   13.3" panel seems to be currently the largest available e-ink panel on the market, no one seems to manufacture larger one at the moment (also see this e-ink form factor limitation Q/A)  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â >> youtube search (reality check)    Similar 13.3" e-ink monitor is announced by SOL Computer, but details were not disclosed and obviously it is not available for sale yet (UPDATE 2016-05: it seems they are just distributing the above PaperLike monitor (re-branded)). Also they currently offer   e-ink notebook e-ink tablets (with Windows and Android) e-ink display with controller board (to build into custom devices)       2016-10-13 update:  These displays are expensive so before buying I borrowed the PaperLike from the friend I mentioned above. And to my surprise I found out that its e-ink panel did not relieve my computer vision issues (although for the friend it did) but it worsened it. (White background of e-ink panel was too bright on long run.)  I found out, that in my case, the actual problems are caused by blue light, intense bright image (of any color) and LCD display flickering (especially when display brightness is set low). After research I solved them using BenQ EW2775ZH available at 200â‚¬:   reducing blue light â€“ display switched to Low Blue Light Plus mode reducing brightness â€“ used low brightness and low contrast levels eliminating flicker â€“ the display is designed flicker-free   So for those reaching for e-ink due to vision problems: It is possible that pricy e-ink display won't necessarily solve them. So when trying to mitigate your problems, you might want to check the above 3 points before buying expensive e-ink display. You can try reducing blue light (initially even without purchasing anything) and you can eliminate screen flicker by keeping panel brightness set at 100% (see PWM explanation to understand why this helps). For me, BenQ EW2775ZH eliminated the need of the e-ink display.    2017-11-15 update:  PaperLike Pro e-ink panel 2nd generation of PaperLike. It supports HDMI interface.  Manufacturer: Dasung (see English site)  This can be currently purchased also via SOL Computer, see the Dasung or SOL Computer site.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â >> youtube search (reality check)
I assume that you are looking for TV in UK. All TV's I listed below have VESA mount so you can mount them on the wall.  If you are looking for cheapest solution I would recommend this TV's (all of them meet your requirements):   LG 50LF652V - Â£537.55 on transparent-uk.com Philips 50PFH5300 - Â£440.33 on www.lambda-tek.com LG 50LF5800 - Â£439.08 on www.lambda-tek.com
You should not go with a card with more than 200W TDP as you have only a 550W power supply. It might work, it might not.  600 EUR is way too high of a budget for just a new graphics card. If you want an equivalent graphics card to the 6850, you could go for a GTX 960. It's faster than the 6850 in fact, and consumes similar amount of power(120W for the 960, 127 for the 6850). Ultra-high end cards like the 980 and 980Ti will be overkill for you, since your PC is old, and they're pretty fast, over 4 times as fast(or even faster) for the 980Ti. The 980Ti also consumes a lot of power, 250W.  If you want to go for a bit of futureproofing, go with a 970 or an upcoming Pascal card. The 970 is an awesome card at $330 with a power consumption of 145W. Pascal cards are new ones coming with an architecture change, meaning they'll be significantly faster for the same amount of money. But you'll have to wait two months for them.
If a good USB Hub with more than 4 ports is what you are looking for then you should check out Anker USB Hubs like this one  https://www.anker.com/products/A7513141  It's a 7 port Aluminum hub, USB 3.0, with a 5V 3.0A power adapter.    As for reviews....  Their site:    From Amazon:    They make hubs that go from 4 ports to 14 ports so there is a lot of choice.  What what I really like about their products is that they stand behind them.  I had an issue with a 2 port hub over a year after I bought it and they refunded my full purchase price.   Their customer service has been fantastic that I can recommend them and their products without hesitation.
A device like this does not exist.  The moment you split the pairs in rewiring the connections at both ends, it can no longer be considered CAT5/CAT5e/CAT6 installation because using the green and brown pairs on pins that are spec'd for the blue and orange pairs creates confusion.  You also mentioned that there would be considerable cost rewiring and that is correct.    So, the question to ask when thinking about splitting out pairs is....  What would be the benefit gained by splitting out pairs to create two separate connections that another switch at the end point or VLANS would not solve?  The answer is there is nothing to be gained by splitting the pairs to create two separate connections because the cost of a small 5 port switch is $30-40 USD which is less than half the cost of the hourly labor to rewire the connection.  Additionally, most Ethernet adapters found on client devices (USB adapters, motherboards, laptops, VoIP phones) and low end "business class" switches will support  VLAN tagging so there is no technical benefit to splitting out the pairs.
What you have there is called mSATA.  These are available from every SSD manufacturer but I am very partial to both Samsung and Crucial as I have used many of their products in the past without issue.  I have provided links in order of preference:   Samsung 850 EVO 500GB Crucial MX200 500GB mSATA   Both are priced right around the same price point and both have excellent warranties.   Will it work in your computer?  Hardware wise?  Yes.  SATA can address up to 8 EB (Exabytes)  or 8 million TB.    Will you OS read it?    Assuming you are using Windows or Linux and not something custom, then NTFS and EXT2/3/4 will address much more than 8EB.  You should be good there as well.
One of my go-to brands for cables and adapters is Anker and they make a USB-C to HDMI adapter that has some really strong reviews:  Anker Premium USB-C Hub with HDMI and Power Delivery  It's best to stay away from "house brands" and brands you have never heard of.  A Google engineer has been testing various USBC cables and has found many which can fry your gear.  Subsequently, Amazon has banned cheap USB cables..
My friend did a very similar thing, but with PCIe 2 put into PCIe 1 slot. The only thing you will see is that the card won't perform as it should - PCIe 2 is almost 40% slower than PCIe 3. As @Mark stated in the comments this difference is between PCI express verions itself, not for the performance of a specific GPU and also depends on the workload.  That said I believe the wait for next generation won't be to the end of the year - for nVidia Pascal it looks like it will be unveiled this month and for Radeon Rx400 Wikipedia says around this summer. All in all I believe the wait for new GPUs to hit the market in quanitites is at most half a year.  Also, that 10x claim for Pascals vs Maxwell is only in specific usages (such as neural networks), but it still will be way faster.
It has been a while since I asked this question and requested whether I could answer it myself but here's a link to what I've come up with which matches the specs, budget and power consumption I was looking for. It's a pcpartpicker part list (please notify me if you can't access it for some reason). While I crossed the original budget marginally ($80), I believe this would be a good choice for anyone looking for a 256W machine capable of running the latest games. It's a Skylake build featuring a GTX 950, 1 TB of HDD memory and 16 GB of DDR4 RAM. I will be using this for (graphics) programming, gaming and probably quite a bit more of the latter.  Any feedback would be appreciated since I'm planning on building it and I'm not really confident about my motherboard and case.
The Lenovo Y50 meets all of the criteria you mentioned.  It has a low profile Island style backlit keyboard, a large multi touch trackpad, comes available with quad core i7 CPUs and gaming capable Nvidia GTX graphics cards.  They start at around 800USD for those options, but can be found a little cheaper as they are recently a discontinued model.  They can also be found with touch screens or UHD displays.  However, the size is 15.6''. This is an industry standard, to go smaller would be impractical but possible if it is a necessity.  My other suggestion with be a MSI gaming laptop.  The GE and GS series come in 15.6'' and have high quality components in all models, suitable for intensive usage.  The keyboard that you would want is the SteelSeries, it is also a low profile and very responsive keyboard, available with multi color backlighting if you desire.  These can be had for right around 1000 USD depending again on configuration.
I would recommend the Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 to you as it is an amazing laptop for the price; Newegg sells it for around $1,000.    CPU:  i7 6700HQ. RAM: 16 GB DDR4. GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M. STORAGE: 1 TB HDD + 128 GB SSD.   It has the latest Skylake processor, DDR4 RAM, a decent GPU (roughly equivalent to the desktop 750Ti) and an SSD. It also has a backlit keyboard and a 15.6" Full HD display.
I finally bought 2 of them  http://www.projectorcentral.com/parts_compare.cfm?pid_1=7456&pid_2=7436  Well to be exact, I bought one. And then realize that the second one is better for me. So I exchange the first one with the second one.  Acer H6510BD http://www.projectorcentral.com/Acer-H6510BD.htm is the way to go.  However, my room has a width of 3.2 m and I want a REALLY BIG screen.  So I search for something similar but smaller throw radius.  So I exchange that with  BenQ W1080ST http://www.projectorcentral.com/BenQ-W1080ST.htm  More expensive. But I think I will be able to get a big 4 m wide TV I have always wanted to work peacefully.  Regular TV would have cost $5k and stuff. This projector only costs $1200.  Yes, the second one is more expensive. So it depends on where you want to put things. If you want to put it on a big room where you can afford some distance between the projector and the TV, then the first one is the way to go.  Note: I should have answered with something I recommend rather than actually bought. However, I finally bought... can be interpreted as I recommend .... I mean why would I buy something I don't think is good? Not sure how the mod would think.
In your budget I would recommend exactly this model which you presented. But there are few other options.  Cheaper:   ASUS Maximus VIII Ranger -> Â£138 on Amazon - around Â£40 cheaper than Hero and it actually meets all your requirements.   More expensive:  This are top end motherboards for overvlocking Skylake maybe it is worth to save more money and buy best possible option if you have top end CPU.   ASUS Maximus VIII Formula -> Â£305 on Amazon MSI Z170A XPOWER Gaming Titanium Edition -> Â£300 on Amazon
You have two good options here both being delivered by ASUS.   Your suggestion, the Maximus VIII Hero.     4x DDR4 DIMMs Max 64 GB Upto 3800mhz 1x M.2 6x Sata 6 2x Sata Express Ample USB  At Â£40 cheaper, the Maximus VIII Ranger.   4x DDR4 DIMMs Max 64 GB Upto 3400mhz Same  storage as the former. Ample USB    It may be worth the extra Â£40 for you to go with the Ranger as it gives up nothing important and will leave you with money to spend elsewhere.
The GTX 550Ti is a discontinued video card (and has been for a couple of years now)  You would be paying a premium on ebay for a (probably) used card if you wanted to find a matching one.    In order to use SLi, you need to have matching graphics cards.  Though the brand and clock speed may be different, they must have the same GPU (and both be Ti or non-Ti) as well as the same amount of video RAM.  If you are not gaming or doing graphical rendering I wonder why you would want two cards anyways?  You are able to use two (and on some models three) monitors with a single GTX 550Ti.    If you are looking for a new single video card of comparable power which can also support multiple monitors, I recommend the GTX 750 which can be found for around USD$100, or the current GTX 950 for about USD$140. The GTX 660 Ti is capable of supporting three monitors, but can be difficult to find because it has been discontinued.    Virtually any video card sold in stores today will support multiple monitors (at least two) and be capable of web content and bluray playback.  Bear in mind that ATi video cards will need to use DisplayPort (or a powered adapter) in order to use three displays simultaneously.
Things to check before buying:   Temperatures If the cpu temp exceeds 50c at idle, it has probably been overheated in the past and experienced more wear than others.  Laptop hinges If not opened slowly and from the middle, hinges wear unevenly and on many models break.  If there is looseness it is indicative of future failing.   Battery Laptop batteries do not like frequent discharge cycles nor years of use.  When buying a used laptop, you can expect to be buying a new battery somewhere in the not too distant future.  You can check the wear level at the same time as the temperatures using HWMonitor from CPUID (freeware).   A 3rd gen i5 at higher clock speeds will outperform a 1st gen i7 in single threaded performance, but in multi threaded applications the difference is less notable.  For your described usage the i5 would be preferable as it uses less power and you will not frequently be at 100% load.  Of the models you listed, as a money saver I would choose the Llano based Toshiba.  The integrated graphics far outperform the IntelHD series (which will make web browsing and video editing smoother) and it is a more recent chip requiring less power than the older i-series (TDP 35W).  The price difference between the next models allows you to purchase a higher density battery for extended use.  Ideally the final notebook you posted (8470P) would have discrete graphics installed e.g. Radeon HD 7570M.  It's not specified in your question, but if it does it's the clear winner.
In this price range you have a few options:   From Nvidia: You really only have one option right now. Note if your going for Nvidia I highly recommend waiting for the new Pascal based GPUs.   The GTX 960. Although the link is to a Gigabyte card you are free to choose from any manufacturer.  From AMD: You have a few options but by far the best is the following:   R9 380. AMD's top card in this price range. I'm a sucker for the STRIX branding but you can use whichever you would like.    In Conclusion  So those two are the clear winners in each category, but out of the two I cannot pose a clear winner. If you would like to see a nice head to head I recommend checking out this one here.
Is this memory compatible with the ZBook?   Yes.  "Up to two SODIMMs, for system memory up to 32GB." - HP's website      Will this memory run at 2666MHz or will the computer/cpu limits its use at 2133Mhz?   I have never heard of RAM speeds being bound by a CPU, and even if it was IMO the performance increase is negligible in everyday tasks.     What will bring me more performances: the 2666Mhz CL18 or the 2133Mhz CL15?   I'm almost positive that the former will be more expensive for starters. Now let's do some math.  Ram Frequency is expressed in Hertz, which means "cycles per second". So the 2666 ram will perform 2666 cycles per second, while the 2133 will perform 2133 cycles per second.  Cas latency is given in cycles, thus CAS 18 means it takes 18 cycles to respond, while CAS 15 means it will take 15 cycles to respond.  Now to do some math.   2666 RAM will take 18/2666 seconds to respond or about 0.00675 seconds. 2133 RAM will take 15/2133 seconds to respond, or about 0.00703 seconds.   So in conclusion, the 2666 is faster.     How big the performance difference will be?   Around 0.00028 seconds.     What will be the impact of 2666Mhz CL18 compared to the 2133Mhz CL15 in terms of energy consumption?   Honestly, I don't think it matters. The ram plays such a small part in the energy consumption in the machine it's probably negligible.
Your size requirements are a very odd size for monitors, so I don't think you'll find one exactly fitting your needs (short of having one custom made). That said, I have found some that are very close.  The ViewSonic VA2055SM: - 8.3 x 18.6 x 11.3 inches - full HD 1080p, 20" diagonal - Currently $84.99, $171 regular - DVI & VGA (only the one with built-in speakers has DVI) Apparently, ViewSonic also has a proprietary panel technology: "With SuperClear MVA panel technology, this monitor delivers the same image quality whether you are looking at the screen from above, below, the front, or the side."  The ASUS VE208T: - 11 3/8 inches high 18 3/4 inches wide (without stand) - currently $112.99, $124.99 regular - 20" diagonal, 1600x900 resolution - According to reviews, good viewing angle - DVI Input
This isn't necessarily the product I'd want but it's a low-end solution for $18.28 USD:    http://www.amazon.com/EnjoyGadgets-Switcher-Selector-Support-Switching/dp/B003AQD5W6  Some IR sender could be programmed to control this. Perhaps something like this: http://www.amazon.com/Global-Cache-IP2IR-iTach-Wired/dp/B003BFTKUC [+$92.00 USD]    There's also a 5x1 option: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049SCB2Y?psc=1 for $39.99 USD
Assuming you have the rest of the hardware/don't mind sharing some with your PC a mac mini would probably be the cheapest option. Why? They're roughly about half the price of the Mac laptop models to start with. Exact prices would vary with model and country.  Downsides? You'd need to supply your own keyboard/mouse and monitor. Its not as portable as an macbook of any flavour.   Its pretty reasonably priced compared to a comparable NUC class machine.   They're also often available refurbished, which may be cheaper. I'd go for a core i5 model over a core 2 model if possible.
Consider the Logic Supply ML100G-10.    RAM is a single SODIMM CPU is an Intel Celeron mSATA drive 2Ã—1GbE NUC   My company uses a lot of NUC-class machines. While I have no experience with this particular model, we haven't had any significant issues with Logic Supply products.  I can't speak to availability or how you feel about the pricing, but it is a NUC and it does have twin GbE ports.
In order to cover Windows, Android, Mac OS-X, and iOS, you'll need a two part solution.  As you've already discovered, Miracast is a wireless display standard. It is effectively HDMI-over-wireless. The Wi-Fi Alliance maintains a list of compatible products. Note that it can be called different things by different vendors; Samsung calls it "AllShare Cast" for instance.  Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 support Miracast. It depends on hardware support in the GPU, which modern Intel CPUs have integrated. Just be aware that having the right OS does not always mean the computer has the right hardware.   The same goes for Android - 4.2 and up have the software capability, but it's only useful if the phone or tablet has the hardware capability.  On the other side...  Apple has excluded themselves by Apple's choice, forcing their customers to purchase an AppleTV box as well. On sufficiently recent Intel-based Macs, part of the hardware to use Miracast/Wi-Di is theoretically there in the CPU, but there's no way to access it.  In order to get the same capability for Apple devices, you'll need to include an AppleTV in your setup. The AppleTV is small, so you can probably find some way to fasten it to the same mount as the projector and just leave it up there. It has Wi-Fi, so you don't need to supply anything but power.  In summary: Your projector will need Miracast-capability and an HDMI port for the Apple TV.
Another, not listed by you solution is MSI GS40 Phantom-001:   dimensions: 13.58" x 9.65" x 0.87" (so the size is close to your preferences) display: it has 14" FHD non reflection screen 16 GB of DDR4 (2133) RAM with possibility to upgrade it to 32 GB Intel Core i7-6700HQ (quad core, 2.6 GHz) not sure if layout of keyboard meets your requirements   It is avaliable on newegg in two versions:   with Nvidia GPU - $1499 without Nvidia GPU - $1379
If you plan to work with Nvidia's CUDA framework right away to do some GPU-based computations (neural networks primarily), you should stick with GeForce 750M laptop.  However, 750M's memory is only 2&nbsp;GB (as the R370X is), so you will not be able to fit any big model into your GPU either way and will be forced to use either cloud instances or buy a separate GPU and somehow connect it to your Mac so the choice is really not too much relevant.  If you don't have any immediate plans to dive into CUDA-based computations, buy either the cheapest option (750M Macs are previous generation, so you will buy them refurbished or used and that may save some money), or the newest (which is R370X) since it will be brand new and you will enjoy warranty period at its fullest.  Also, Apple did release the Metal framework for native shader programming in OS&nbsp;X, which allows to use literally any supported GPU from OS&nbsp;X to program your computations, and there are some frameworks that use that possibility (Memkite for example) - that will give you deep learning and computer vision on any mentioned GPU (and even on built-in Iris Pro which is built into the CPU). But the support of Metal is in its early stage, so there are not too many frameworks and projects using it for machine learning (though, you could pioneer in that).
Up to now there is no DSL/VDSl modem/router supported, because fo problems with the driver and the management of the modem itself that connects to the Internet Provider.  So, if you just want a name, I suggest you to look at ASUS DSL-AC68U because it supports a lot of OpenWRT features and it's directly maintained by ASUS. In sense that Asus bases its firmware on OpenWRT  Just to know it, FRITZ!Box 7490 has its own operating system that is NOT OpenWRT.
I have bought Philips 43puh4900.  Positive:   there a lot of parameters to set. After some time you find the combination that works well as a monitor. you can also avoid overscan/underscan easily the screen is matte not glare so you can use it many hours at a day for programming 43 is better then 40 so you can split the screen in 4 monitors   Negative:   I made a big mistake cheated by manual and brochure. It says under hdmi (translated from italian) "the TV can do 3840x2160 at 60hz". I suposed it was hdmi2.0 but unfortunately at 60hz it goes at chroma subsampling 4:2:0. So it is not usable and it is NOT hdmi2.0. At 30hz it does 4:4:4 so you can use for programming.
1080p's pretty common and 'trivial' to drive - any midrange card should be able to handle it at high or ultra settings on 90% of games.   I'm an nvidia guy myself, and I'd say a 960 (or even a 950) ought to handle it with no issues. I've pushed a 660 up to quad HD (1440p) with most settings turned up on relatively modern games, and it served well. (I went 4k, and needed something with a little more oomph. Card got rehomed, and the new owner's pretty happy with it).   I'd also suggest this as an interim card. It will handle 4k output but not gaming. When you do get a 4K monitor, it would make sense to pair it up with a 980ti (or its pascal or polaris equivilent). You have a good usable card now, and can get a less than top of the line card when you need it. On a all nvidia setup, you could use the old card as a physics co-processor. DX12 will also let you use 'mismatched' cards together.   The 970's a decent card but in the situations where you need all that texture ram, the last .5 gb's on a slower bus. Typically not an issue, but taking a step up (to the 980) or down (to the 960) might be an idea.   I'm not familiar with AMD, but the same rule of thumb, that the mid range cards are a good buy with the view to a future upgrade should hold through.
You could do worse than look at the compactrio.  http://www.ni.com/compactrio/     NI has invested thousands of person-years in this proven, validated,   certified, and rugged hardware and software platform that tens of   thousands of customers have deployed. With industry certifications and   wide-temperature range, thermal, EMC/ESD, and shock and vibration   testing, the rugged CompactRIO platform helps you to deploy reliable   systems that last. Plus, benefit from a wide-range of services,   outstanding customer support, and the industryâ€™s most extensive   ecosystem.   NI are usually very helful.  NI hardware was used in the large hadron collider so I expect it would suit your application.
Except for the backup requirements, the Gemalto IDPrime MD seems to fit your requirements. Some caveats:   It tops at 2048 bits for RSA; for ECC, it supports only three standard NIST curves (P-256, P-384 and P-521), not custom curves. From experience, at the APDU level, the signature operation is really a command to do a modular exponentiation with the private key; thus, the hardware is compatible with all kinds of RSA (PKCS#1 v1.5, PSS...) but the hashing and padding is done on the host computer. The MD 830 is FIPS 140-2 lvl 3, the MD 840 is EAL 5+. There appears to be no model that is certified for both sides of the Atlantic. The cards are available as standard-sized plastic rectangles, nominally compatible with all standard readers; but you can also get them under the "IDBridge" format which is a USB card reader with a card in it, with a small size. Individual cards can be bought from cryptoshop but it is a bit unclear exactly what you get; there are IDPrime MD and IDPrime .NET cards that use the same packaging, and the latter do not support ECC (only RSA). On the bright side, individual price will be about 20â‚¬. The cards are supposed to be reprogrammable with custom applications (in a subset of .NET) but I never tried that and I don't know if it requires extra licenses or things like that. I think that the certifications don't extend to cards which have been reprogrammed.   As for backups, I am ready to assert that you do not want backups for signature keys. In fact, presence of a backup for a signature key can only lower the legal value of a signature (but then, this begs the question of why you would want to sign anything; a signature you generate is a legal weapon pointed back at yourself).  For encryption keys, backups are necessary to avoid data loss, and then there is no really good solution with these cards, if you want private keys to never exist outside of the certified hardware. For personal usage, even for the paranoid, you could arrange a key generation ceremony in which you generate the keys on an offline computer, booted over a CDROM and with no hard disk; the computer would then push the key in 4 or 5 smart cards, which would be so many backups.
It not only depends on your CPU. Games differ by CPU utilisation some are more CPU dependent (for example Arma III) some are more GPU dependent  (for example Far Cry 4, Witcher 3).    To avoid CPU bottlenecking in all games I would recommend you:   GTX960 - from NVidia R9 380 - from AMD   If you compare versions with the same amount of VRAM the results are comparable. I would personally recommend version with 4 GB VRAM because new games use more and more VRAM.    To avoid CPU bottlenecking in GPU dependent games I would recommend you:   GTX970 - from NVidia R9 390 - from AMD   The second option is in my opinion maximum for your overclocked Athlon. I would recommend not to go higher than GTX970 or R390 with your CPU. From this duo I would recommend GTX970 if you want to play only in FHD and R9 390 if you want play in higher resolution.    Edit: What case do you use with your ITX motherboard ? How long GPU will fit to your case ? It can be important if your case is not aired enough you should look for card with lowest TDP.
Referring to a manual of your notebook there is one RAM slot (DDR3L 1333/1600) in your device, which can support up to 8GB of memory:     But after checking memory modules compatible with your CPU (ARK site) it says that maximum supported frequency of memory for your CPU is 1333 MHz:     Therfore, I would recommend replacing your 4GB RAM module with a     G.SKILL (F3-1333C9S-8GSL) - DDR3L, 8GB, 1333 MHz, CL9 - $33.99 at newegg.com
It's really hard to find keyboard which meets all your requirements. So I will recommend you quite expensive keyboard but it will meet most of your requirements.    WASD V2 105-Key ISO Custom Mechanical Keyboard - base cost $150  It's customizable mechanical keyboard with 105-key layout. It provides buyer with many options which allows it to be the closer choice to your requirements.  Layout:   You can choose from French/UK and many other layouts. Additionally you can customize other keys.    Silence:   You can choose between different types of Cherry MX switches and sound dampeners. I would recommend using Cherry MX red switches (+ $10) - it is most silent type of Cherry MX because of linear switch mechanism and softer spring than black ones. To make this construction even more silent you can add to it sound dampeners to keys but it is also quite expensive (+$25).  Color:   Unfortunately there is no possibility to order whole keyboard in white color but you can order it with white keys.   Cons   not avaliable in EU but it can be shipped to EU price (with Cherry MX red switches($10), sound dampeners ($25) and shipment to France (~$45) it is ~$230) no additional keys on the left     I assume that 105-key layout is the most important requirement ? Because I would recommend some cheaper devices in 104-key layout like Natec Medusa 2 White.
None.  At this moment there is no phone or tablet which supports UHS-II. Of course you can put UHS-II card in normal slot because it's backward compatible but there is many opinions that this cards are working worse than UHS-I cards when they are in UHS-I slots.
I recommending to you try the Apple keyboards (works ok in Windows too). They coming in two versions (US or UK)     Pros:   low profile keys, so:   it is an "typer's" keyboard (usable, but not the best for gaming) silent, but with good "press feedback"  USB connected (and contains 2 usb ports on both sides for connecting the mice) silver aluminum body (even better on the sunlight as white) with white keys you can buy it from any apple dealer in EU nice design (IMHO) :)   cons:   no extra multimedia keys on the left side... in the function keys the primary symbols are the apple's multimedia functions, the f1..f12 is printed in small letters (they works as functions keys) price   Ps: Me using it 3+ years and i'm absolutely happy with it.
If you can spend up to 250 USD and if it doesn't have to be very tiny then I would recommend to look for a smartphoneÂ¹. Several apps exist, among them VLC for Android, iOS and Windows Phone. I just tried it on Android which works fine with m3u playlists (I never bothered to try until now and VLC on my Windows Phone somehow doesn't read the same file, even if I replace the path delimiters).  You can usually get good midrange smartphones in the 200 USD/â‚¬ price tier (+ the price for a storage card) with Bluetooth 4.0, more comfortable file sync through apps like Syncthing or ownCloud and HD movie playback capability. Here are some related questions that have already been asked:    Android phone under $180 with great specs Smartphones under $100 for Android Development   Edit: In case you're wondering, you can get decent a2dp in-ears from QCY for under 20 USD and decent fit (I forced Comply foam tips on mine, even though Comply doesn't want support them).     You don't have to use it as a phone that spies on you if you don't want to.
After some investigation what's difference in performance of DDR3 and DDR4 I decided to stick with 5 years old hardware - as what I saw, performance is not so drastically different (and actually with current mobile CPUs it could be even worse). Yet I'm left with "only" 16GB RAM for now.  I managed to buy almost-like-new ThinkPad T420s, equipped with i7 processor and secondary nVidia graphics card just for ~450USD, including docking station. (Well, I still have to spend another money on 512GB SSD drive)    Edit - specs what I got:  Lenovo ThinkPad T420s (~450 USD)   CPU: Intel Core i7 2620M motherboard: Lenovo 4173AZ1 8 GB RAM (didn't check what brand, ... see below)   Docking station (with DVI and DP) (~35 USD)  And of course I wanted to tune it little bit, so I bought additionally:   SSD Samsung 850 EVO 500GB Kingston SO-DIMM 16GB KIT DDR3 1333MHz CL9 (8 + 8 GB)   ... so my final spending is ~720 USD for 3.4 GHz i7 beast with 16 GB RAM. But indeed it is used notebook, so there are some things which don't shine so much and I'm considering further polishing of it - but I don't need to rush with these.
It's really hard to find exact data about keys travel distance and force needed to actuate. But I would recommend you some keyboards which are good choices in my opinion.  1st option:  We can start from Razer mechanical keyboards with orange switches they are a little better than Cherry switches if we talk about travel distance needed to actuation.     We can find 3 models on newegg.com which have this switches, it's always Razer Black Widow in different configurations. $80 - $100 on newegg.com . What is important about this keyboard is that it's not flat keyboard.  2nd option:  Flat membrane keyboards with scissor switches. Full travel distance ~2mm and force needed to full key press 40g-60g.  Scissor mechanism in membrane keyboards is mostly used in laptops but it is also used in slim/flat keyboards.    The biggest downside of this mechanism is that it's easier to break this switches (than normal membrane keyboard switches) by hard hitting the keyboard or when it falls to the ground but how often your cable keyboard lands on the ground ?  When we look for good membrane keyboard with scissor switches I would recommend this keyboards:   Razer Deathstalker - $57 - $300 on newegg.com it depends on additional features. I'm an owner of this keyboard and I'm not really happy with the wide spread of keys but it's only my opinion. Cougar 200K - $30 on newegg.com Cherry Strait - $72 on newegg.com Gigabyte GK-FORCE K7 Stealth - $53 on amazon.com   3rd option:  Rapoo ultra slim keyboards - it's also scissor mechanism here but this keyboards are all wireless and ultra slim. I don't know exact values of travel distance and force needed to actuate but I assume that values are comparable to 2nd option.    ~$30 on newegg.com (~$60 with touchpad)   I've put this keyboards in other option because they are ultra compact and wireless.  Conclusion:  It really depends what are your other preferences (spread of keys, cable/wireless, mechanical(longer full keypress)/membrane with scissor switches, additional features like: touchpad, backlight, additional keys etc.)  Personally I would choose mechanical keyboard (Razer orange switches or Cherry MX red) and use 0.4 mm o-rings (I'm not sure if they fit to Razer switches but if not Razer also has o-rings) to shorten the travel distance and make the keyboard more silent.
Coincidentally, Cherry has just released a new switch, the MX Silver (a.k.a. MX Speed), which has a much lower actuation point:      Unfortunately, the travel distance is too quite long, I'm not sure why (comments are welcome if you know). I also don't know how much mm of rings one can add to reduce the travel distance.  The MX Silver is used in Corsair Rapidfire keyboard series, which contains both compact and complete versions:    A few additional nice features (quote from gameranx):     Additionally, these mechanical keyboards come with a detachable wrist rest, key pullers with spare WASD and QWERDF key caps that are often used for first-person shooters along with MOBAâ€™s. Furthermore, there is a USB 2.0 pass-through port in order to allow users to connect various USB devices such as headsets or a mouse.   As expected, the keyboards are overpriced:    Corsair Gaming K70 RGB RAPIDFIRE Mechanical Keyboard, Backlit RGB LED, Cherry MX Speed RGB(CH-9101014-NA) costs 170 USD in the US. K65 RGB Rapidfire: $139.99 K70 Rapidfire is listed as $129.99.     Some images for the K70 rapidfire RGB:          Some images for the K70 rapidfire:    Some images for the K65 rapidfire RGB:      Compatible o-rings (which can be quickly installed with a Keycap Puller Tool a.k.a. Key Cap Remover):   Cherry MX Rubber O-Ring Switch Dampeners Red 40A-L - 0.2mm Reduction (125pcs), ~1.5 mm thick, soft (15 USD) Cherry MX Rubber O-Ring Switch Dampeners Blue 40A-R - 0.4mm Reduction (125pcs),  ~1.8mm thick (15 USD) Rosewill  2.0mm (0.078") thick (uncompressed) (15 USD) Buna-N O-Ring, 70A Durometer, Black, 3/16" ID, 5/16" OD, 1/16" Width (Pack of 100) (2 USD) Rosewill RO-100T Silicon O-Ring Dampeners, for Cherry MX Key Switch, Transparent (135pcs)  ~2.0mm thick, 50A (15 USD) OcUK Tech Labs Noise Dampening O-Rings for Cherry MX Keyboards- Clear - 125 pieces, Shore 40A, 1,6 mm thick (10 GBP) http://lpwl.bigcartel.com/products have a nice choice: "Thin" = 1.5mm || "Thick" = 2.5mm || "XXL" = 3.0mm. (material : Silicone; Hardness : 40A) (around 10 EUR, ships from France)   Note that you can stack o-ring dampeners (example).  O-ring hardness can be inferred from the model name (I took the slide from this great presentation):      For further information regarding o-rings, this reddit page is a gold mine. Amongst other things,  it points to:    Regarding which thickness to choose, this webpage gives a good summary. Also, there is:   deskthority - What is the best size for me to use and what hardness would you suggest? reddit - What o-rings should I buy?   It simply depends on how the bottom of a keystroke is, e.g.:    vs:  .
The Arion Rapoo Black KX 5.8GHz Wireless Smart Backlight LED Built-in Lithium Battery Mechanical MX Keyboard - Black (85 USD) is mechanical, in addition to being flat (2mm travel distance, 50g actuation force). And they don't have any inclination, unlike too many other mechanical keyboards.   Full specifications:   Key Structure:Yellow mechanical key switches  Lifecycle: 60 Million Key-press Key press force:50 + / - 10g  Key press whole travel: 2.0mm + / - 0.6mm    Unfortunately, they use their own switch, which have a higher actuation force than the Cherry MX Reds. (I have read they feel similar as Cherry MX Blacks)            I couldn't find any force vs travel plot nor a non-compact version of it. According to this message from the Amazon seller, they don't have any non-compact version of this keyboard.  The Amazon seller also sent me this table summarizing the properties of the Rapoo key switches:
If you are looking for the routers with the best 5 GHz Wi-Fi performance I would recommend you this product:  Best choice to $300:    ASUS RT-AC3100 - $300 on newegg.com   It's actually one of the best if not the best dual band router on market. It has slightly better results than WRT1900ACS in 5 GHz speeds and additional features like WTFast and MU-MIMO. But it's also $100 more expensive so you have to think if you need sliglitly better performance and additional features for this price.    CNET test of this routers Wi-Fi performance (short distance - 15 feet / long distance - 100 feet):  5 GHz   RT-AC88U - 644/345 Mbps    2.4 GHz   RT-AC88U - 229/102 Mbps
If you are looking for the routers with the best 5 GHz Wi-Fi performance I would recommend you this product:  Best choice to $200:   Linksys WRT1900ACS - $200 on newegg.com   This router is really good when we are talking about Wi-Fi speed and stability. It's best choice in AC1900 routers in my opinion and best choice for you.  CNET test of this routers Wi-Fi performance (short distance - 15 feet / long distance - 100 feet): 5 GHz  5 GHz   WRT1900ACS - 536/349 Mbps   2.4 GHz   WRT1900ACS - 170/59 Mbps
If you are looking for the best performance not looking at price of the PSU I would recommend:  EVGA SuperNOVA 850 T2 - $220 on newegg.com    Description:  If there is no price limit the best avaliable PSU's have Titanium certificate like SuperNova T2. It was made on Super Flower platform so it guarantees high quality of components. It is passive until load around 500W. It has avarage efficiency on low loads around 88.7 % and on normal loads avarage efficiency is 94%. EVGA also comes with 10 years warranty what is really good offer.    Most important features:   80 Plus Titanium certified semi-passive - quiet until ~500W load top end efficiency  10 years warranty fully modular     Final conclusion:  It is top end PSU made on components from SuperFlower with higest performance among 850W PSU's. If you are looking for hardware and not looking at price you should think about buying this product. If you want to buy PSU which will work also good with your setup and will be cheaper (but not so quiet and with worse efficiency) I would recommend my other answer.
If you are looking for the best choice for paid money I would recommend:  EVGA SuperNOVA 850 P2 - $160 on newegg.com    Description:  This PSU has Platinum certificate and it was made on Super Flower platform so it guarantees high quality of components. It is passive until load around 340W. It has avarage efficiency on low loads around 84.2 % and on normal loads avarage efficiency is 92.5%. EVGA also comes with 10 years warranty what is really good offer.    Most important features:   80 Plus Platinum certified semi-passive - quiet until ~340W load really good efficiency results on low and normal loads 10 years warranty fully modular     Final conclusion:  It is really good PSU made on components from SuperFlower. If you are looking for best efficiency for spend dollar you should think about this PSU. It will work good with your setup and stay quiet when PC is idle or it is under small load. If it's not enough for you should think about Titanium EVGA PSU which I described in my other answer.
Apple TV - $74.50 on newegg.com  You can stream your display to your monitor connected to Apple TV (through HDMI) using AirPlay for Apple devices with OS X 10.8 or newer. Or you can use AirParrot 2 software to connect it to your older Mac or Windows PC.    Requirements:   According to this apple site if your MacBook Pro is from early 2011 or newer. You will need only Apple TV media player 2nd generation or newer. Here is really good tutorial how to connect your Mac to Apple TV. If your MacBook Pro is older than early 2011 or you need mirroring from Windows PC you will also need AirParrot 2 software it costs $13.
The only way you get wireless display capability from an Apple device is via AirPlay, which requires a 2nd Generation or later Apple TV and OSX 10.8 or later. The actual connection between the Apple TV and the output device will be HDMI. Who makes the display doesn't matter.
I am going to recommend the Corsair HXi HX850i CP-9020073-NA 850W. This is a fully modular 850 Watt power supply that is 80 PLUS Platinum certified. It has a built in fan, but it doesn't even turn on until the load reaches around 350 Watts.  This unit comes with a handful of unique features, like the fan test button. With this, you can test the operation of the fan even before installing the PSU into your case. The unit also has a mini USB port that you can either plug directly into the motherboard (included cable) or into a USB port on the back of the computer. With this, you can monitor performance and adjustment of fan speed and multi-rail/single rail mode. I do not remember seeing a driver disk in the box, but it is easily downloadable by following this link, selecting "Corsair Link", and selecting the most recent file at the top.   Corsair lists the 850 Watt unit at $199.99 (USD) not on sale, but if you shop around, you can find a lower price.   Corsair also has a 1000 and 1200 Watt version of the same PSU, so if you want a bit more breathing room, you have options.
After no response I bought NZXT GRID+V2 and I can easily recommend this hardware to anyone looking for internal fan controller with many features.  Setup:  I installed it in Phanteks Enthoo Evolv ITX with one 200 mm intake fan and three 140 mm exaust fans.      It is connected to motherboard through USB connector and to PSU (12V) with Molex 4-Pin connector.  CAM Software:  This is dedicated software for this fan controller which allows not only controling fans but also gives many options of monitoring hardware.   fan controller (it allows to customize curve of each fan speed according to GPU or CPU temprature)      system monitor (CPU,GPU,RAM,HDD,SSD,MOBO,NET)        FPS overlay (allow to put and customize overlay with FPS, CPU temprature and load, GPU temprature and load and other visible on screen)      Final conclusion:   I paid for NZXT GRID+ V2 $40 and I think it's absolutly worth this price. It is not only fan controller it is also really good system monitor and fps overlay. I can recommend it to anyone looking for internal fan controller.
I think the most useful way to answer this question is to start with the hardest part of the answer and work my way down       should have as much open-source firmware or security certifications as possible.   As such my starting point would be the coreboot page, since that lists systems which support opensource firmware   I'm picking thinkpads here. I'm familiar with them, and the removable parts are mostly trivial.On this list, the T60 look handy. many of these features are found on newer thinkpads, but its worth considering some of the modern, boneheaded moves lenovo has made. The newer ones have worse keyboards, and of course, you need to find a superfish free version. Go with intel graphics in any case. Further research shows that "Ministry of Freedom" sells somewhat newer models than my initial recommendation of a T60 preflashed and those are worth a look. That said, the features I like about the T60 are true here too.   Lets go down your list. I have an R60, and its the 'cheap' equivilent of an T60 so I have a decent idea what the features are. Being a thinkpad, thinkwiki has a great rundown on the features.  Yes, its an older machine, but I have them running reliably with minor upgrades. They're really nice machines with a low end SSD.     Must feature a removable battery     Two latches and it pops out     Must feature a (somewhat easily) removable BIOS battery   Requires removal of the keyboard and that's about it. 3-4 screws, and you don't even need a service manual to find it. Bit finicky, and I'd recommend a spudger and a small screwdrive (cross head). There's a video here on the process.      Must feature a removable drive   Its an old school thinkpad. One screw, pop out the cover, yank the drive     Must be able operate without a persistent storage drive   R60's USB bootable. I've done it a few times. Maxing out the ram might be an idea.     Must be able to boot from a CD / DVD either via USB or internally     Yup. Onboard, standard ATAPI drive, boots off USB fine.      Must feature at least three USB type A ports   Yes     Must be able to operate with Linux derivatives   As an older machine, compatibility is solid. I'd be reasonably confident even running a full DE on it, though my machines run windows 10 or xubuntu/lubuntu.   Should have as much open-source firmware or security certifications as possible     Price should be sub 500 USD if possible   Ebay prices are significantly below that. Could even buy spares. I strongly recommend maxing out the ram if possible.   These are solid machines, and despite their age hold up well.
Look at Mikrotik routers based on RouterBoard hardware and RouterOS software. The prices are competitive even with dumb switches, reconfiguring the router to act as a switch is perfectly normal (our firm uses them instead of standard switches on regular basis), they are quite robust, and it allows quite in-depth monitoring and control of the network, including per-port basis.  The only serious disadvantage is that the interface is not really intuitive and definitely takes some serious reading of the documentation, even for relatively simple tasks (like aforementioned reconfiguring as a switch). You can easily get lost in the countless features and miss the one you're looking for - the feature-richness may be a bit overwhelming even to a professional.
Practically the only android phone I can think of that's got a keyboard these days is a blackberry. Specifically the priv. It runs newer versions (6.0 is coming soon(, and flagship specs - it runs a  Qualcomm 8992 Snapdragon 808 Hexa-Core. Not the latest and greatest but reasonably solid, 3gb ram, and seems to have some privacy centric addons.
Epson has a line of printers specifically designed to be refilled - called the ecotank/supertank line - they're a bit pricier than 'regular' printers (which are absurdly cheap cause they're selling you the ink at a markup) but they are essentially CIS printers with external ink tanks. Since you arn't popping out a tank designed to slowly drip ink, its a lot neater, and it dosen't have the abitrary pages per cart count most printers would have.   There's a bunch of models - the l310 seems to be the basic model but the US seems to have a different lineup with all of them being all in ones
Corsair CMFSL3X2-128GB 128GB Voyager is one I use myself, it's an extremely compact design, 128gb and has 90mb/s write speed, which seems to fit your specifications, however, I'm not sure about how strong the key ring attachment is, I've had this for three years now and I've had no issues so far, so I guess unless you are handling it roughly, I don't see why it could break.  The next best thing I can find is the Samsung USB 3.0 Flash Drive FIT 128GB (MUF-128BB) which takes size reduction to the extreme. (It's smaller than my Bluetooth mouse adapter which is almost invisible). It's 130mb/s read/write speed. Only problem is that it doesn't have the capability to be attached to a keyring. But I guess you can't have everything.
I'm finding this hilarious. The pseudoscience is stunning. That device is a pretty standard microphone that was used for attaching to a landline. The proper name escapes me (I'll update) but you can find it as a telephone suction cup microphone for between 5-20 dollars on amazon. I am unable to identify the sound card he is using for the capture, and the software he's using seems to be wavelab. Any good soundcard should work for this I suspect  I'd note those things are good fun, and he might be picking up noise off of his power lead. I'm unsure what the seemingly quarter inch connector is leading off of the sound device.
Look no further. Optimus Tactus.      Zero travel distance and mere touch to activate. Plus on-the-fly reconfiguration of the layout, even quite thorough, with arbitrary key shape changes.  I'm not entirely sure how practical it is for active use, but it definitely fits the bill.    Unfortunately, availability might be poor - I'm not sure if it ever entered trade. But another (inexpensive!) alternative is the Magic Box Laser Keyboard. (available e.g. on Ebay.)    Again, zero key travel distance and no force required, plus a neat form factor for use in travel.
Have you considered the Motorola Moto 360?  It's got a coloured screen and looks pretty stylish in my opinion. Though according to reviews.. You need nightly charging, however considering you charge your phone everyday anyway, I don't see why that would be that much of a problem.
These seem to be viable options:   Mini-ITX is 6.7" x 6.7"  Micro ATX is 9.6" x 9.6", however, some are smaller e.g. this MSI H97-G43 is 11.6" x 8.7" FlexATX is 9" x 7.5" but is harder to come by   These will fit based on their sizes although I don't know whether the holes or I/O ports will line up.
Not really 'current' hardware but hothardware tested this roughly 3 generations ago (and that's pci-e 3.0 era hardware I believe) on a core 2 duo. And the results were pretty darned dramatic. Graphics performance was roughly 50% better. And well, modern cards still do not typically saturate a PCIe 2.0 connection, especially on the mid range. Consider this. PCIe 3.0 is about twice as fast as PCIe 2.0, and you'd be using your cards at x8 in SLI, so clearly, x8 speeds on PCIe 3.0 (aka x16 speeds in PCIe 2.0) should be enough.   Yeah, you can wait for the next generation but a 960 actually feels like a compelling upgrade if you need to upgrade now. You can always use it as a dedicated phyx card should you choose to get a pascal, and well, in addition to the wait, we don't actually know if the next gen pascal and polaris chips actually live up to the hype. Nonetheless if you choose to wait, those cards ought to drop in and work as well as long as they're PCIe.  I don't think the performance drop would be that bad, and in a scenario where you're gradually building up a system, this would make a ton of sense.
The SQ8 Mini DV Camera 1080P Full HD Car DVR is best I could find, it's very small and can run for about 100 minutes at 1080p at 30fps, which should cover most presentations. It comes with its own stand, so if you have a desk, which I assume you do since you can out a laptop down, you can just put it in front of your laptop and stream it to your laptop. The price is also pretty decent. Only questionable thing is that it is from Gearbest, which is an American company but it sells solely Chinese products, and some people have a thing about buying things made and designed in China. But for as long as I have been a customer of Gearbest, everything I've brought so far hasn't ha an issue, so I guess it's your call.
I found one additional phone which meets almost all your requirements (and is not Asus Zenfone 2 or Asus Zenfone Zoom or other Asus).  Lenovo K80   CPU: Intel Atom Z3560 (x64 quad core processor, but only 1.83 GHz frequency. It's the same processor like in Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML.) GPU: PowerVR G6430 2 GB or 4 GB RAM (it depends which version) 5.5" LCD IPS 1920 x 1080 Antutu score: 41380 Storage: 32 GB or 64 GB (no SD cards support which can disqualify this phone for you)   It can be bought:   2GB RAM - 32GB ROM version - $230 - on Amazon.com 4GB RAM - 64 GB ROM version - $180 + tax - I only found it on AliExpress.com (Goldway) I actually bought there my Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 and I was really happy with this transaction
If this requirements which you listed are all what you need I would recommend:  MSI H110M Pro-VD   $56 on newegg.com support for i7 processors (LGA 1151) IntelÂ® H110 Chipset  M-ATX form factor up to 32 GB RAM support (2 slots, dual channel) USB 3.1 support   If you won't overclock it is all what you need and there is no need to spend more money for better chipset.  There are sometimes problems with compatibility for Ubuntu with:   Intel GPU on Skylake CPU's - solution Sound: RealtekÂ® ALC887 (exactly with 5.1 and 7.1 support) - solution Ethernet: Realtek RTL8111H Gigabit LAN - solution
I usually tend to review hardware I have in these answers. I'll make an exception, and review hardware I'm looking at seriously, and a bit of quick audio teachery.  If I had these requirements, I'd look at the AV40 (which alas, I could not get my paws on) or the AV42 (Which is on my wishlist), both by M-Audio.     The AV40 has a reputation. Wirecutter considers it the best PC speaker you can buy. It has an aux in, a headphone out. Its powered (the left speaker has all the active things in it) and has a volume knob. It's even supposed to have little lights that tell you the speakers are angled correctly. Its also out of production.   I'm waiting on wirecutter to look at the AV42, but reviews are decent. Its not going to be a bass monster (get a proper sub for that), but its still going to be a decent pair of speakers. Monitors are designed for fairly flat response anyway.   I suggest this over the AV32 since its got a bigger woofer(and as such better bass). Its arguably prettier than its elder sibling.     Both models are under 150 USD.
While its a little below the pricerange, and the bass isn't spectacular I'd suggest taking a look at logitech's z150. They're fairly cheap, compact speakers. They arn't super bassy (I consider them to be barely passing the Indica test (I listen to how the start of the indica track Valokeilojen Vampyyri - where a VW van starts up)  for bass, though they're reasonable for everything else.  I replaced a larger pair of altec lansings that are the nokia 3110s of the speaker world with these and they've been acquitting themselves very well. Unlike the M Audios, they're easily available at the average computer store and if someone said "Hey, I need a pair of speakers" - this is very likely what I'd point them at.  They're clear (enough), and don't really clip at the levels I use them at. They have the same option of front headphone and aux ports as the speakers I'd rather have (the AV40/42 in my other answer), and very practical, compact general use speakers. The AV40s are a muscle car. This is a little kei car that'll do well enough.  These may not be the speakers you end up with, or drool at, but these speakers will handle most things, with aplomb for not much money.
I go to http://comparewear.com  Then I can compare so many things there.  I definitely need heart rate monitor.  And bright screen.  I was looking for either Samsung Gear S2 (that can connect to any android), or Microsoft Band.  That being said, my friend also recommend garmin vivoactive. Battery can be charged once every 3 weeks.  I then go to  http://comparewear.com/wearables/?vs=gearS2&vs=vivoactive&vs=vivoactiveHR&vs=band2  There I saw that vivoactive and Garmin Vivoactive HR. is chargeable every 3 weeks. That is FAR FAR plus. I think that's what I am going to choose. It has all the features I need, like heart monitor.  Obviously I recommend the exact same thing I am choosing. So before I go ahead and buy, please let me know if I am wrong.  The HR model have barometer. I am not sure what it's for. But a plus. I like the look of the vivoactive normal.  By the way I was going for Garmin Vivoactive because http://comparewear.com/wearables/?vs=gearS2&vs=vivoactive&vs=vivoactiveHR&vs=band2 said it has heart rate monitor. The thing is, https://www.shufflerun.com/garmin/vivoactive-hr-vs-garmin-vivoactive/ says that it's not 24/7. The heart rate monitor seems to be consuming battery. Tough choice.  I would pick the vivoactive VR if it can last 3 weeks between charge (say by turning off 24/7 heart rate monitor). I would also prefer watch with non rechargeable battery.
Nvidia has just announced the Nvidia GTX 1080, which is ~25% faster than the Titan X and significantly cheaper ( 600 USD vs 1000 USD).  From http://www.anandtech.com/show/10304/nvidia-announces-the-geforce-gtx-1080-1070/2:    From http://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080-launch/:    It's difficult to find exhaustive specification comparison tables between the GTX 1080 and Titan X (I guess they should appear soon). A few more comparisons GTX 1080 vs Titan X:   9 Tflops vs 6.1 Tflops     From some Nvidia official presentation:      The Nvidia GTX 1070 was also announced:     From cnn-benchmarks:     GTX 1080 > Titan X: Across all models, the GTX 1080 is 1.10x to 1.15x faster than the Titan X.
There are the 2 contenders that I know of:   Lenovo ThinkPad P50 HP ZBook 15 G3   Both of these machines match the above requirements and more:   Up to QHD displays (P50 offers integrated color calibration) Pro graphics 6th gen Intel dual and quad core CPUs (up to XEON) 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports (which also serve as USB 3.1 and video outputs) PCIe X4 SSD drives.   Regarding the keyboard, it's like shoes, you have to try it yourself to see if it fits.
I chose the combination of LD MEI 1000 and Shure SE215CL. The Shure device had no relevant features which would justify the price and the better headphones were a really good investment.  Tested and evaluated as good.
We ended up going to a local PC store today so my mother could physically examine the printers. I will give a brief run down of the printers we looked at, it may help others with their choice.  My mother had already decided that having an SD card was now a must rather than a nice to have.  HP  The store had a decent range of HP MFP's however none of them had all the requirements. They were missing either one or two different requirements. For example, one had 4 colour inks but was lacking the SD card slot, where as another had all the requirements but the coloured ink was in a single cartridge.  The build quality was pretty solid across all the models and the prices were roughly similar with a rough average of about Â£120.  Epson  It looked like the store had quite a range of Epson printers, many in budget or under. I tried to insist that we should at least look at them in the interests of fairness but was over-ruled. I am only mentioning them here as balance.  Brother  There were two Brother devices that met our requirements apart from build quality. The display models looked shabby and flimsy, especially considering the prices of them were quite high. That said they both made our shortlist because they could handle A3 paper. They were eventually discounted as we felt they would not stand up to regular use.  The models we considered were:   DCPJ4120DW (Â£120) MFC-J4625DW (Â£160)   Other  The store we went only had a single Samsung printer and a single Lexmark printer available. The Samsung did not have an SD card slot and was well out of budget and the Lexmark was a standalone printer with no scanning capabilities.  Canon  I have left Canon until last as we ultimately ended up getting a Canon device. The build quality of all the Canon's, even the sub-Â£50 ones, was excellent. On a similar par to HP.  We were also hugely impressed by the design philosophy that had been followed on the mid-range printers, they looked "unprinterish".  The two that made it on to our shortlist were:   Pixma MG6851 (Â£100) Pixma MG7751 (Â£150)   These are almost identical printers but we ended up choosing the Pixma MG6851. The things that swung it were the fact it was on sale at Â£80 and the fewer inks. My mother was concerned that the extra "grey" cartridge in the MG7751 would make the ink more expensive in the long run, even though she preferred the minimalist look on the MG7751.
I found only one solution which supports HD and DD floppies. There is no information about ddrescue compatibility but I couldn't find this information on any floppy drive I was checking.    Dell Professional USB Floppy Drive - $49.95 on floppydisk.com      Features:   1.44MB/720k support USB interface PnP   Conclusion:  It's actually quite expensive but if you want to be sure that FDD supports DD and HD diskettes you are 100% sure with this product. If you are looking for cheaper solution maybe there is possibility to find something from second hand on ebay or other like ebay portal but if price isn't to high for you I would recommend this solution.  5.25" thoughts:  For 5.25" floppies I recommend other question because there is no FDD which supports both this formats and meets all your requirements.
Yes, there should be plenty of Z170 motherboards that support DDR4 3200 MHz memory, otherwise, memory at those speeds wouldn't be sold.  Take a look at this one for example.  As long as the specifications of the motherboard say it supports that speed, you should be fine.
Ulefone Power also has a ~6000mAh battery and can charge other phones/devices and is priced very reasonably.  Update: I will retract this as a recommendation as I have some concerns about the quality/reliability of mine.
Personally I think that it is more technical support question but  I will say few words about it.  Explanation:    Super user explanation what OC memory in MOBO description means. What does it mean for you ? It means that your motherboard will support memory up to 3600 MHz in dual-channel and up to 3866 MHz in single-channel. You have to load RAM XMP profile and it will work with desired frequency.   My proposition:  ASRock Z170 Extreme7+ is very good motherboard but only if you want overclock your new setup if not Z170 chipset will give you only support for higher frequency RAM what won't give proportional efficiency to the price paid for it. So if you won't overclock you should look for motherboards on H110 or B150 chipset and 2133 Mhz RAM with lowest CL.  B150 recommendation:   B150M MORTAR - $90 on newegg.com   H110 recommendation:   H110M PRO-VD - $56 on newegg.com
Have you considered Vizio TV's? I am not sure if they are available in your country but they would fulfill all your requirements and you might even come in under your budget!  You could most definitely get a 50" FHD (or 1080p) Vizio television for ~$800, but you may also be able to get an M-Series Vizio, this being their 4K model, for around $800.   Vizio has Wi-Fi and is DLNA compatible.   The refresh rate is 120Hz which is the recommended minimum for Gaming, Sports etc...  The input lag is great with Vizio as they offer a Gaming mode which reduces input lag.   It is also VESA mountable.   Although the television isn't 3D, it does have  a Full-Array backlight with local-dimming. This translates to brighter colors and darker blacks with less light bleeding through in darker areas.   I worked at a Best Buy very recently and these are my TV's of choice as far as budget, quality, and feature set are concerned. Definitely worth a look!
If I am understanding your question correctly, check out Chromecast Audio. It might solve your problems.   As far as latency is concerned there shouldn't be much, but it is very hard to know the answer to this portion of the question without knowing all the variables, and there are A LOT when it comes to wireless frequencies, as I am sure you are aware.
Not sure if there are 100% open source commercial products out there, but here is an alternative.  Would you consider to set up for example a Raspberry Pi + USB webcam combo? I've had one running for about two years now, capturing and saving a JPG image once / minute. That would cost 50 - 100 USD depending on what components are used. However the system has not been 100% reliable and every now and then I've had to re-plug the USB camera in (YMMV).  I have published bash + PHP based scripts at Github, utilizing v4l-utils. I have also blogged about it. It is internet-accessible with authentication and HTTPS encryption online on my "private" domain (just storing it on hosts files). I understand this takes some engineering effort, NAT port forwarding etc. but nothing that complex.  This doesn't provide video but it might not be needed to observe "what's going on in my apartment". I'm sure there are other solutions out there but I like building my own stuff and customize for my preferences.
As long as you have DDR3 Memory at the right speed you'll be fine, as this is what your motherboard specifies. All three of the RAM modules you listed would work perfectly fine.  Brand names don't necessarily matter, but I've tended to have better luck (and customer service) with well known brands.   You may want to keep an eye out for latency and clock speed if you're really gung-ho about getting the most speed. The CL or CAS latency numbers are what you look at here, but often the difference in latency is so small that there really is no discernible difference. The lower the latency, the better, in essence.   If I were you and I had a choice between those three, I'd choose either of the Kingston branded ones.
You can always use an IP camera. Ex: http://foscam.us/  Not the best quality but it usually does the trick.  IP cameras usually run their own web server so you can just open up a browser tab and type in the camera's IP ex: 192.168.0.133 or something and you will be able to see what the camera sees. And if you get a camera that can move than you will also be able to Zoom and tilt from the browser tab.  The next step would be to set up a VPN in your apartment. I like to use OpenVPN, it has worked well for me. there are a ton of tutorials how to set one up on a RasPi 2-3. Just connect to your VPN and then go to your IP camera's page and you should be good to go.  Bonus:  If you only need one camera than you can use: https://www.milestonesys.com/our-products/  One camera License is free. Thats what i use and its pretty robust. Do note that you will need a computer for this. A NUC or Brix should do well, I understand that might be expensive. Thats why its not totally needed.
You can use a raspberry pi or something similar and control a gpio pin of the board remotely. The gpio pin should be attached to an optocoupler ic. With the proper wiring of your button cables to the optocoupler you can hard reset,power on or off the pc.
I'd post as a comment but I can't do that.  What about the Orange Pi?    http://www.orangepi.org/  ARM  Open Source  Docs might be lacking though  Can control things
The specific model's going to dependent on the style of plug you have locally. Depending on your specific needs, there's two options.   I've not used either of these personally (but I've been looking at them) but if you wanted a prebuilt minimal fuss wireless setup, belkin's WeMo has decent/mixed reviews. Their website is terrible but you're looking for something like this for your local voltage.  A lower cost option would be a rf controlled plug - this would be something similar to what I'd look for but once again, your exact options would depend on your local voltages and plugs. Quite a few folks have modded these for rpi control by rewiring the remote.
I tried all four devices you asked to compare. In terms of accuracy -and responsiveness- Headmaster and Headmouse Extreme are the best. Nothing beat them, they are just perfect like a standard mouse is. If you have a good head movement you'll take the best from them.  I'm a quadriplegia C4-C5 and I design with an Headmouse Extreme with sip/puff and the standard windows -or linux- onscreen keyboard. Inkscape, Illustrator, Photoshop, 3dsmax, Coreldraw, whatever software I try it works perfect. Occasionally I do simple video and audio editing. I have a two monitor configuration, sip and puff system is arm mounted on desktop, I use two reflective dots -to improve efficency- on the right side of my glasses, I can send photoes if you want. I can move the cursor all over the lengh of both monitor, from left to right and vice versa; if the headmouse looses the signal before acclompishing this task, I slighty switch back with my head, Headmouse re-finds dot signal and I finish that cursor movement. Headmaster doesn't have this little drawback -very little, You'll not ping pong your cursor all the time-; I felt uncomfortable wearing HMaster headset, it's also wired to the PC so you are not free to go away with your wheelchair. A simple dot on a comfortable support is the easyest option. Maybe in the future a lightweight wireless ultrasonic device will give a reborn to HMaster. Every InfraRed based device -SmartNav, Tracker, Headmouse- suffers from direct sunlight, but your display watching experience does it too, so You will ever not be in direct sunlight.  Today I also tried QUHA ZONO gyroscopic device, I was very attracted by this device: wireless and indipendent, enough lightweight, easily portable, can be used outdoor with smartphones etc.. I had to say that I couldnt try it in the best conditions and that I was looking for something performing like my headmouse. And in fact ZONO is something else. I need an easily portable -not to be used outdoor- and I'll go with an Headmouse Nano. I'll give another try to ZONO, but his gyroscoopic ancestor boost tracer seemed to suffer of the same 'kinda floating cursor' behaviour.  When I tried TrackerPro it was a bit slower than HMouse, it gave me back a light delay between my head movement and the cursor one. SmartNav is much slower so it gives a bigger delay.
The PS3 had 2 major advantages - it was an open system and the 'cell' architecture, which was easy to program for and fairly powerful. They were also slimline  I'd argue that the most sensible way to equal that would be a cluster of regular 'consumer' PCs. The wording of the question though means I'll need to cheat a bit and I'll suggest a steam machine.  Why?  Most modern consoles are x86 based, with laptop class video. They are locked down though there's projects to try to get xbox360 and ps4 running linux.  Many of them have nice small form factors (the 5x5 and NUC form factors would be a good starting point). They have reasonable compute power, and in most cases, nuc class machines compare favourably in price to modern consoles. If you standardise on one model, you can stack em. If you need more powerful machines or a supported OS 5 or 10 years down the road, its a common ISA likely to have support.  Unlike a traditional console, its unlikely someone will take away your ability to run your own OS on it.
I'm not sure why I didn't find this solution a little faster, I guess I was just googling the wrong thing.  The phantek hub needs to be plugged into a fan connection on the mobo, but not the CPU_OPT.    Then, in the bios, you need to allow your fans to be controlled by something other than the bios.    After that, everything worked fine.
Don't know why this question is being downvoted, seems reasonable, and I am in the market for something like this myself. I like the look of the MSI GTX 960. Can drive multiple 4k monitors, has 3xDP, 1xHDMI and 1xDVI-D outputs and is apparently very quiet - the fans can be stopped completely in "silent mode" which should be enough for non-gaming use.  http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/msi-geforce-gtx-960-gaming-2g,review-33260.html
The linked drive may use a PCIe interface, but it not a PCIe form factor card. It is an M.2 form factor device and requires an M.2 slot. Without some sort of adapter, it will not work in your M.2-lacking motherboard.  The M.2 form factor is designed to connect to multiple interfaces - SATA and PCIe - over the same physical connector. Depending on the capabilities of the connector and device, they're keyed differently to prevent you from attempting to connect incompatible devices (a PCIe-only device in a SATA-only M.2 port, for instance).  The adapter you linked should do the job. As far as PCIe 2.0 vs. PCIe 3.0 goes, PCIe 3.0 devices are backwards compatible, they'll just run slower.  As far as lane count goes, you can use a card that demands fewer lanes (4x vs 16x) in a slot with more lanes; the other pins aren't on the card, and therefore do nothing. Going the other direction requires paying more attention. Some cards need the bandwidth of all the lanes they're spec'd for, and some boards have things like 8x electrical slots in 16x mechanical slots for security/fit purposes (there are missing pins on the board end).
My wife is using Lenovo Yoga 3 - 14 (not pro screen below):     I bought it with this specs:   Intel Core i7-5500U 8 GB (SO-DIMM DDR3, 1600 MHz) 256 GB SSD SATA III 14" FHD IPS Touch Screen Intel HD Graphics 5500 + NVIDIA GeForce 940M   What it is used for ?  Most demanding task which this notebook is performing is Diablo 3 it's working well but not at max detail settings. Mostly it is used for internet.  Touchscreen ?  It's really great I didn't think that it will be so easy to get used to using touchscreen instead of mouse but it's really nice feature to browse websites using touch...  ...but we had problems with touchscreen at the beginning. When I firstly turned on this notebook touchscreen wasn't responsible it was working sometimes on half of the screen sometimes on 3/4 of the screen rest of the screen wasn't giving response. After few hours on forums I found solution. I had to delete all nVidia drivers and install older ones (newest drivers are working well) additionally I had to check what model of touchscreen I had and install drivers to it from manufacturer (not included with notebook). There was also some fix for Windows 10. And from this procedure touchscreen is working really well.  About touchscreen itself. If not a problem above I would talk about it only good things it's really responsive and precise. It's so easy to browse Internet with this of course to games like Diablo you need mouse but to all simple tasks touchscreen will be enough.  360Â° modes ?  When we are talking about other modes than laptop mode. It switches to it when you move screen more than 180Â° automatically (you can also turn it on manually). Weight of this device allows to use it as a tablet. The biggest downside of this modes is when you use it vertically www pages are not scaling well (tried in Chrome, FF and Edge) there is often need to scroll them horizontally.  Price:  I bought it for ~$1000. I didn't found exactly the same model on newegg.com or amazon but there are many models on amazon which allows you to choose a model which fits your preferences:   i5 5200U / no additional GPU for $864 on Amazon   Of course you can look for other configuration which will fit you better.  Final thoughts:  The most important thing is that I was really disappointed with problems at the start with the touchscreen, maybe it was only my notebook but I found many threads about it. I could also return it to the shop but I resolved the problem myself...  ...but if we won't look at the troubles at the beggining I would really recommend this notebook. The biggest pros of this notebook are touchscreen and quite good components for the paid price.
Sony w807C  Price: can only speak from where I live, but it seems from your comment that it is alittle over budget.  Screen size: 43, 50, 55  Resolution: full hd  wifi: yes  SmartTv: Yes, android, nuff said?  Refresh rate: 100Hz with 800Hz motionflow  Response time: 10-15 ms (Do not have any source on this, but this is stated from Sony who visited our store.)  VESA mount: Yes  3D: yes, active, no glasses included.   I would not recommend 4k, because 4k is useless without HDR, and there is no HDR standard today, which means that if the state a standard, and you television do not support the standard, again it will be useless. So even I you buy a 4k tv with HDR you might not be able get the full experience with 4k.  From what I have learned Sony has the best response time 10-15 ms on their flagships, LG around 30 ms and Samsung 45-50 ms. Please see if you can find a source on this. The Sony w807c has Sonys "finest" display, the  Triluminos display. This means that it will show a good picture when viewing from the angels, please see link provided.   https://www.quora.com/What-is-Sonys-Triluminos-technology     DLNA server which is Mezzmo   I am unsure of this, but it runs android smart tv so if anyone should support it, I would be android.   Since it is android smart tv you can use the ps4 control to play games from google play, and aswell control the tv with it.   THe tv has a built in google cast, which means that you can cast you smartphone directly to the tv.
The Lenovo ideapad range are quite good value,  I don't know what country you're from but in the UK you can get a lenovo ideapad 305 for under Â£300. It has an i3, 8GB ram and a 1tb HDD. For it's price it's pretty good value for money!  in regards to ram and battery, both can be replaced! I have a slightly older version which came with 4GB of ram. Upgrading it was no issue whatsoever   http://www.johnlewis.com/lenovo-ideapad-305-laptop-intel-core-i3-8gb-ram-1tb-15-6-/p2267362?sku=234935249&kpid=234935249&s_kenid=d5c81421-e622-4bbb-a094-8dfdb15f1321&s_kwcid=402x1488619&tmad=c&tmcampid=73
I'm going to essentially steal RPhipps answer from here and suggest an older X series thinkpad.   I have an x220, and from his ebay link, they're roughly in the 200USD range, and around 12 inches. While its an older system, sandy bridge holds up well and its really lean.  Nice things? Its trivial to upgrade. Mine's got roughly twice the ram as stock, a 250gb SSD replacing the 300gb stock disk and an easily replacable battery.  All you need is a small screwdriver
I gave Obmerk Kronen plenty of time to post his own answer based on his comment, and even prompted him to do so, but he never did...  So: any of the three models of printer made by https://www.raise3d.com/.   2+ printing nozzles - An available option, so Yes. <= 40 micron layer height. - 10 micron layer height, so Yes. Capable of printing in all commonly available plastics & support materials, e.g. PLA, ABS, PVA, HIPS, Laywood, TPU etcetera. - Yes. Capable of printing high-temperature materials such as Polycarbonate, PET & Nylon - Yes. Not dependent on proprietary consumables supplies - able to use generic 1.75 or 3mm filament. - Can use generic 1.75mm filament, so Yes Large print volume - 200mm+ in at least one dimension. - Smallest printer is 8x8x8 inch (8 inch = 203mm), largest 12"x12"x24" (305x305x610 mm), so Yes Capable of running from an Australian 240V power socket. - Accepts 110-250v, 50/60Hz, so Yes. Enclosed cabinet. - Yes Capable of operation with open-source software - Proprietary slicer supplied, but also accepts gcode, so Yes Low cost:- must be below $10,000 AUD, preferably below $5,000 AUD. - The largest, most expensive model (N2 Plus) is US$3499 from the manufacturer, which is currently around A$4840, and their smallest (which meets all the other specifications above) is advertised on an Australian retailer's site for A$2950, so Yes Australian supplier. - Advertised on https://www.3dprintergear.com.au/, but not available yet/preorder so Probably Yes.
OnePlus 2 and Xperia Z3+ both feature the Snapdragon 810 chipset which is infamous for its overheating issue. Though OnePlus 2 manages to reduce this effect to an extent, it can't eliminate heating in its entirety.  As for Samsung S5, the heating wouldn't be much as it has the older 801 chipset. Qualcomm has said to address this issue in the newer 820 chipset (read Xiaomi Mi5 and Samsung S7) albeit removing FM receiver if you were into it.  More than specs, I trust the reviews from GSM Arena So search the ratings/reviews for your future phone there.   If you don't have a budget limit, Samsung S7/Edge is the way to go in Android.
I would suggest going to Skylake.  However, I don't know what kind of prices you'll pay for it, but I'll throw some things our there and you can decide how to proceed.   Motherboard, one option @ ~$98 Gigabyte GA-Z170-HD3 ATX LGA1151  Processor, @ ~$195 Intel Core i5-6500 3.2GHz Quad-Core (you could bump down to 6400 or an i3-6100 for good performance/price)  RAM, you will have to have DDR4, @ ~$35 G.Skill Ripjaws V Series 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR4-2400  This is what I'm considering for a modest upgrade for myself.  I also used this, http://www.logicalincrements.com/# to help me make some recommendations along with http://pcpartpicker.com/ to look at similar parts and prices.  Both sites are great tools.
Sharp LC-32CFE5111K looks OK, if only they had a slightly smaller model.   Would also like to buy it from a real shop, but they appear not to like 28" models or recording models so much.
For my dev work, I use a Dell 7440 with 16GB of RAM on a 256GB SSD. Tried a touchscreen, and found the smaller screen with integrated touch capacity just isn't the best when it comes to smaller motions and specific points to click within code or a field. Also, the touch capacity reduces overall screen size due to additional internal hardware requirements.  I have a machine with another 500GB SSD, an XPS 14, and found it not a usable as the E7440. The keyboard and integrated mousepad/touchpad aren't nearly as user friendly.  My wife has a Folio 14 with 16 GB of ram, i7, 256gb ssd.  With many dev environments running online and online repo's, and the projection over the next few years to go that route, massive amounts of internal storage for dev isn't necessary.
The SteelSeries Apex M800 Customizable Mechanical Gaming Keyboard uses a QS1 Switch, and a low-profile layout. Around 180 USD.   Switch Type: Mechanical Switch Name: SteelSeries QS1 Throw Depth: 3 mm Actuation and Reset Depth: 1.5 mm Actuation Force Needed: 45cN 60 Million Click Lifetime
What you're describing here is a drawing tablet, or a pen tablet, but usually all of these are made to act like a real pen, so left clicking is by pressing the pen tip on the pad's surface, or the screen in case of Cintiq or Surface pro or Samsung tablet 10.1 ... Etc many of these has even pen pressure sensitivity, some have tilt and rotation sensitivit. You said you need a separate dedicated left click button, usually these pens have one or two buttons on the side, usually used for right and middle mouse click, but in most cased, they come equipped with a software to customize what this do. The price tag is something to consider, usually the more pro (for artists) and the larger the pad is, the more expensive it is, but since you don't care about pressure sensitiviy, you don't need the high end. If I werr you, I would check the specs in order to see if you can customize the side clicks to left click before making a purchase.
If money is not the issue, go for a Lenovo P50 which is already mentioned in the previous answer. I have one with Xeon E3-1505, 4k display, Samsung 950 SSD, 16GB RAM (ECC DDR4 and you can have 64GB max), it has a Quadro M2000M Graphics card.  Keyboard quality is beyond any doubt.  But the absolute dream is the cooling of the system. Most of the time the fans stand still. Where the heat goes? I have no idea - maybe it is beamed directly into space.  Jokes aside, I have been a Thinkpad user since 2003 (A31p, Z61p, W500) and have waited over 6 years until Lenovo offered something of "Thinkpad" quality. This is it.
A bit late to the party on this one, but I can tell you to avoid (at least for now) the Dell docks that may have been recommended to you at the time of your XPS-13 purchase. I tried both docks on two separate XPS-13s, and neither dock worked correctly. The Dell forums are filled with customers angry with the failings of the TB-15 dock, and it's not even offered for sale on their website any longer. However, it is still available on Amazon with no mention of the hardware difficulties, so beware.  I tried the Cable Matters adapter that Allan suggested above, and unfortunately the one I ordered from Amazon arrived DOA.  The one adapter that I did find very useful for me is (Sad to say) Dell's own DA200 adapter. It plugs into that USB-C port and gives you an ethernet port, USB3.0, VGA and HDMI ports. Pretty handy and works flawlessly for me every time.  I've also heard some people had great success with the HooToo Shuttle. There are various versions of the Shuttle, one of which has another USB-C port that could be used for charging too. That sounds great, except I really need DisplayPort support.   Overall, I've had this laptop for about three months now and I still can't find an adapter that does exactly what I'm looking for. Hope you do better, and if you do, share it with us!
I have a first generation Asus Transformer (TF101) that I leave plugged in constantly. It is used as a digital picture frame and wall mounted home automation control panel.   It is a bit aged at this point, but it does run Chrome (versus the default browser from a few years ago). My assumption is that Chrome will work for you, as I have very few problems with Chrome on the large variety of sites I utilize. Prior to it becoming a permanent fixture to my wall, it was used to watch flash videos (yes, it can handle flash) in addition to other web surfing duties.    Amazon currently sells this tablet for $70 (used) for the 16GB model and $290 (new) for the 32GB model.  There are several newer generations, but I do not know the differences between them and this first generation one.   I have had no problems with heat with this tablet.  My one complaint has been that the speakers are very poor. Even at full volume, it can be hard to hear when the tablet is sitting on a coffee table 4 feet from you.  The tablet can be upgraded from Honeycomb (3.1) to Ice Cream (4.x) for sure. I have a version of CyanogenMod installed.
A new tablet (versus my previous answer) is the Samsung Galaxy Tab. This is several years newer than the Transformer and faster. It is also thinner.  When my Transformer became a wall fixture, this was the replacement I purchased. The Amazon review says that it comes with Honeycomb (3.0), but I assume that is outdated because mine arrived with Lollipop (5.0).     I don't keep this one on constantly, but I do use it for multiple hours at a time watching Netflix, Youtube or other video streams. The battery is great. When I have it plugged in while watching these videos, there is no excessive heat. As a bonus, the sound is a lot better than the Transformer too.  Amazon currently sells the 16GB version for $150 new and the 32GB version for $150 used.
You must consider the following possible scenarios that would lead to data-loss:   hardware failure water (inundation) fire earthquake time degradation of backup medium   Consider this setup: 2x 1TB hard drives of different types and manufacturers, RAID / copy on both the same information.    Keep drives in separate locations (aka different homes). This should take care of problems 1,2 (if the inundation is localized aka in your home) and 3. To protect from 4 you can either buy or build a very solid steel case or consider the backing up your crucial part online. To protect from 5. you should consider backing up your data on Archival Paper. You can get 6 MiB / sheet of paper (two sides).      Paper is different. Do you remember the punched cards? EBCDIC and all   this stuff. For years, cards were the main storage medium for the   source code. I agree that 100K+ programs were... unhandly, but hey,   only real programmers dared to write applications of this size. And   used cards were good as notepads, too. Punched tapes were also common.   And even the most weird codings, like CDC or EBCDIC, were readable by   humans (I mean, by real programmers).   http://ollydbg.de/Paperbak/   More here: http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/134427-a-paper-based-backup-solution-not-as-stupid-as-it-sounds
What does exactly "taking screenshots" mean?   1) You are using the tablet's camera while looking at the monitor, or  2)  capturing the tablet's screen (so that the page is rendered on the tablet itself?).   In the first case, you could be better off with different kind of hardware (e.g. raspberry Pi with PiCamera which you can program at will). In the second case, you might open the tablet and put a heatsink on (again, Raspberry Pi heatsinks with self adhesive thermmally conductive tape would probably fit a tablet's SoC nicely).   Otherwise, I think that having the consumer-grade tablet plugged in 24/7 is very hard on the tablet. As alternative, you could use professional-grade Android hardware, which is used for electronic cash registers, such as:  http://www.customamerica.com/en_us/scheda-prodotto.jsp?codice=240  (don't know about the specs of those, but I assume they are built do be plugged 24/7, I could be mistaken)
Before buying an ASUS laptop, please read this first. -Thanks ArtOfCode for pointing this out.    ASUS makes good general use Laptops. I've owned an ASUS laptop a couple generations older than this one and had no issues other than the battery life left a lot to be desired.  Keyboard feels very solid (similar to a MacBook Pro). Trackpad could be a little better but worked quite well. Solid USB other connections. Not wiggly.    ASUS X751LX
An alternative option, if you are willing to use something other than an android tablet, would be to use a Raspberry Pi.   It can run for weeks without any problems It's very power efficient, since it lacks a bult-in display, battery, and a lot of the other hardware typically found on Android tablets It's cheap, with the cheapest model, the Pi Zero, costing just $5, and the one with WiFi, bluetooth, and a 64-bit quadcore processor costing $35   The Pi can also run Android, so you can use the software you already wrote, but can also run Linux. It can also run "headless", i.e with no display connected, and can still do graphics processing. It's something I'd definitely look at.
There are plenty of good answers already. Let me sum up and add my experience:   use hard disks, not tapes use actually magnetic HDDs no SSDs (not only a question of cost, but also long-term storage, see http://www.anandtech.com/show/9248/the-truth-about-ssd-data-retention) it's debatable if server HDDs (build for 24/7, fewer spin up/down) or notebook HDDs (the complement) are better. If in doubt, use both types. I encrypt my backup hard drives, so the data is not easy prey use some kind of tray (internal or external) mechanism for easy swap I use an internal bay to have good SATA connectivity, USB is slower,    but if you do not have eSATA on your laptop of course go with USB.   You didn't mention if you need to backup Windows or Linux, or both, so it's hard to suggest a backup solution. Personally, I've been using http://rsnapshot.org/ for like 6 years which is ultra fast, the backups are ultra accessible (like you are used from your file system).  Another solution might be unison https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/ which I use to sync remote servers. It might be overkill for the unidirectional way of a backup.  And last but not least: Keep your backups geographically distributed! You probably didn't mean "catastrophe" like in the movies, but in case you did, you do not want to have all of your backups in one city/country/continent.
I have to admit, I had to educate myself about Gurobi.  It looks like it is a software suite for linear optimization problems. It also seems, it is a regular one, i.e. with "simple" C++ and R sequential implementations.  For that, any CPU in your budget will do. You should just try - within your budget limits - get the best clock/cache/cores combination. An AVX512 capable CPU seems to make sense.  But let me offer an extended perspective on this.  If performance is your main concern, you should have a look at GPU computing. As for GPU accelerated solvers, see e.g. https://developer.nvidia.com/amgx, which gives promising speedups of a factor of 10 within your reach.  Maybe, spend only reasonable money on an average CPU. If you get the Gurobi vendor to support AmgX, you can buy also a reasonable CUDA-capable GPU and still have speedup by a factor of 10, which would not be possible by any economically feasible CPU.  See also e.g. http://vratis.com/blog/ OpenFOAM and other software does actually already support AmgX, so maybe it would not take too much effort to convince Gurobi to think about it.
Found some alternatives (which do not fulfill all requirements) during my search:  CoDrone   https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/728836843/codrone-learn-to-code-with-programmable-drone/description https://forum.robolink.com/   Drone Pi (Raspberry Pi + MultWii)   http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Drone-Pi/
This does not answer your Question directly, but provides another approch: I would keep the current device and go with a solution wich cuts the 24/7 charge to some hours per day. This stops the overheating and you do not need to buy a new tablet. To do this I would buy a time switch, which is a device that switches a socket on and off based on the times you set on the device. This way you can keep all devices plugged in and the device disables the power source without further do. To have this work perfectly you have to find a time span which holds your charge at your desired level across all devices, as an example 3 hours loading, 3 hours on battery should keep your devices over critical battery levels. However if the power consume across all devices is to far part you should consider using a second time switch for this device/s. I would group the devices based on battery capacity and charging speed and aim to keep the battery level between 20-80%. Also note that the Li-Ion battery does not charge in a linear way and significantly charges slower from about 80% charge level.
I own the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1 (T530) WiFi edition ~260â‚¬ (LTE Available ~290â‚¬) running Android 6.0.1 through an unofficial CyanogenMod port, which works well. The sound is loud and clear, but really depends on source quality sometimes. It has:     10.1" screen Supports Lollipop 5.0.1 (up to 6.x by community) Decent speakers MicroSD card reader Cases with stand and/or keyboards (not included, around 20-40â‚¬)
Buy a used 15" MacBook Pro.        an SSD       The used market shifts quickly, but right now there's a Mid 2010 15" with 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD on eBay for $499, buy-it-now. Preserved for posterity when the eBay page goes down.   Worst case, buy one with a normal HDD and install an SSD yourself. It's not that hard, and you can use any standard SSD. Plus, you now have an external HDD for use as a Time Machine backup.        decent 15" screen, meaning good viewing angles, good colors as high of a resolution as that amount of money can buy      15" non-Retina Pros have a 1440x900 IPS (high viewing angles) display, and can run an external display or two without a hitch. I use my 13" on my desk every day, the quality is comparable to my Dell U2515H. It's also bright enough to be used on its own.        usable trackpad      Apple makes the most usable trackpads I've ever touched. I haven't used a mouse in weeks; I use the trackpad on my 13" Pro and my external Magic Trackpad 2 (same technology). No one comes close in terms of feel and usability - even simple things like thumb/palm rejection are implemented flawlessy.    You shouldn't have any problems staying well within your $800 budget, especially if you're not looking for newer hardware (which you don't need for the tasks you mention, a 2009 Pro would blow those out of the water).  They're made of aluminum, a.k.a. they're built like a tank. It's hard to actually damage one to the point you would notice it in daily use. I dropped (flung, actually) a 2009 13" Pro from a backpack about five feet in the air. It flew across the room, squarely hitting the corner a steel shelving unit. It left a nice dent in the casing, and I thought the edge-to-edge glass would be broken... nope, the casing absorbed the impact. That's a tiny dent, especially considering the forces involved. Another picture.  A common argument against Apple machines is that they're 'too expensive' - actually, they're cheaper to own over their lifetime when you take into account resale value (which Apple laptops hold, and no other laptops do).
If you just want to do some light work such as web browsing, video watching and document editing, then you can just get a Chromebook. They do all these tasks but run very fast since it is a very light OS. The only draw back if that you can't run Windows programs on it (since its Chrome OS).The Acer Chromebook 15 is only around $350 and will run all those tasks fine. The screen is 1080p which is good enough for video watching.  The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 series is also a great choice if you want Windows. It is $750 with pretty good specs. The screen is also a 1080p display but is better quality (better colors). The screen is also a touch screen which is surprisingly useful and easy to use.
Bitcoin mining will not be worth it (will not earn much, the earnings will not be enough to cover the electricity costs). The Nvidia Geforce 920M is a very weak card and the Iris 6100 is pretty strong for a integrated GPU, so they should be around the same performance (one may outperform another slightly because of optimizations). Both are not great for video rendering but they will suffice. It doesn't really matter which one you get if they are same specs. The amount of RAM is also a big factor as you want at least 8GB. Both of these cards will not render anything over 1080p well.
I can speak for the bitcoin mining aspect only:  You must be aware that it will not be profitable no matter what you do with the notebook. But I guess you want to do some bitcoin mining to understand the concept (which I generally endorse).  Buy the cheaper of both notebooks, then buy some USB ASIC Miner which are available for around $10 and give you performance of 330MH/s to 2.5 GH/s which is around 6 to 50 times faster than your i5 and takes a fraction of the power. Examples for these gadgets are USB BlockErupter (https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/block-erupter-usb-beginners-guide/) which is the lowest end available. The high-end for a small USB stick is The Avalon Nano (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1022764.0) with around 3.6GH/s and $55 price tag.  Still not profitable, but at least it is a plan.
DVDs come in various varieties*, for example DVD-R (RW) 4.7GB (4.4GiB). Using these for important data (backed up very week/month) alongside atleast 2 separate Hard Disks (possibly with at least storage medium one off site in case of disaster) can be effective method of ensuring your data is safe.    DVDs can be bought as 'spindles' (which in packs of 100 4.7GB discs can be bought for around $20 USD), which can also act as form of rudimentary storage. DVD Wallets are also available if you want storage with possibly more protection:    Optical discs are much less susceptible to electrical damage, as data is written as physical dents in the structure (it is a form of non-volatile storage) - complex components needed to read the data are not attached to the disc, reducing (integrated) points of failure and in some way making them waterproof.  But they are usually thin and fragile so are easy to break or scratch (and otherwise corrupt the data). Also if kept in poor conditions, the glue holding them together could break down and make them easy to split, or the layers containing the data could be damaged (by oxidation etc). However many DVDs do come with a lifetime warranty, and (more expensive) archive quality discs are available.  Formatting shouldn't be as much of a problem (heavily depending on format - see below*) as along as your DVD and ODD both can use the same standards they should work. HDDs and SSDs (and USB drives, SD cards, etc) require a partition table and filesystem formatting, and support for different formats for varies across systems (e.g. Windows only really supports NTFS and FAT (and exFAT), and possibly BTRFS - it needs more drivers to access other filesystems).    *DVD Formats - They are A LOT of optical disc standards, and you need to bear in mind which format you are getting if you want to maintain compatibility (A DVD Multi with Read Write, Blu-ray, CD functionality may be able to read all of these):  Supported by Panasonic, Toshiba, Apple Computer, Hitachi, NEC, Pioneer, Samsung and Sharp, also supported by the DVD Forum. Should be supported by most DVD-ROM equipment.:   DVD-R: Can record data only once and then the data becomes permanent on the disc. DVD-RW: Read writeable (usually using phase transition), but may have shorter lifespan. Also DVD-RAM   Supported by Philips, Sony, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Ricoh, Yamaha and others. In my experience, some systems may not support them out of the box.   DVD+R: Can record data only once and then the data becomes permanent on the disc DVD+RW: Read writeable (usually using phase transition), but may have shorter lifespan.   Developed by Sony, Samsung, Sharp, Thomson, Hitachi, Matsushita, Pioneer and Philips, Mistubishi and LG Electronics.   Blu-ray: Not as compatible and more expensive per disc, but can store more data (25GB single layer, 50GB dual layer, other formats can support 100GB+. Data density is a lot higher due to using a smaller blue wavelength. BD-RE discs are read-writable. A similar format called HD DVD was available.   Other   M-DISC: A hardware variation of DVD or Blu-ray standards that apparently should allow data to be stored for up to 1000 years due to resistance to temperature, humidity, ultraviolet and full-spectrum light etc. However requires a higher powered laser to be recorded too. See also Archival Disc (a similar archive orientated format by Sony and Panasonic designed for the disc to last at least 50 years).   Many of the above formats are also available with more than one layer (e.g. DL (Dual Layer), which are similar but can record more data. However, they are only supported by capable equipment (e.g. DL need Dual Layer support).  These standards vary because of manufacturers implementing there own standards, or by the use of different technologies. Other optical formats can be compared here
So the Ideapad 15" tech specs will be  Processor   Intel Celeron N2840 processor( 2.16GHz 1333MHz 1MB)   Operating system   Windows 10 Home 64   Display type   15.6" HD AntiGlare 1366x768   System Graphics   Intel HD Graphics   Total memory   4.0GB PC3L-10600 DDR3L SDRAM 1333 MHz   Hard drive device   500GB 5400 rpm   Optical device   DVD Recordable   Network card   Lenovo BGN Wireless   Bluetooth   Bluetooth Version 4.0   Warranty   One year   Pointing device   ClickPad   Battery   3 Cell Li-Cylindrical   Price   Â£229.99    - less than Â£300   And also for the gaming laptop I recommend to use Acer E5-573G because of it specs:     Best 3D performance under $500 for a new laptop with the extra   value of 1TB SSHD, 8GB RAM and 802.11ac wifi card.   And the breakdown for the specs:  CPU    I5-5200U (2.2GHZ-2.7GHZ, 15W)   GPU    Nvidia Geforce GTX 940M 2GB DDR3, GM108 (Maxwell I), 384 shaders, core@1072MHZ, DDR3@1176MHZ, 64-bit bus Revision A2 that covers the quality of playing FM16   Motherboard Chipset    Intel Broadwell-U PCH-LP (Premium), Acer ZORO_BH   RAM    Hynix 1x8GB DDR3@1600MHZ  2 banks of memory available, totally good for all over speed and memory bandwidth test   Storage    HDD : Seagate ST1000LM014-1EJ164 SSHD, 5400RPM, 32MB cache 1TB   Camera     1280x720   WiFi / Ethernet    WiFi: Atheros QCA9377 802.11ac Ethernet: RealTek Semiconductor RTL8168/8111 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet NIC   Battery    37Wh   So for me these laptops are well for feeding his needs and wants. Also, this will last good for 3 years without upgrade; but so if you want more power then it will cost probably.
Benchmark comparison: http://www.cpu-world.com/Compare/993/Intel_Core_i5_Mobile_i5-6300HQ_vs_Intel_Core_i7_Mobile_i7-6700HQ.html  The i5 6300HQ is a good CPU for the programs you use. However, it is definitely fair to say that with the more threads offered by the i7 6700HQ, performance, especially with programs that can utilise multiple threads, will be improved. The advantages to hyper threading are explained well here (Visual Studio is mentioned): https://superuser.com/questions/774028/advantages-of-hyper-threading-in-software-development  To summarise the link above,  Hyper threading is useful if you are using your machine for software development (as in your case) because current IDEs are optimised to take advantage of the multiple threads. This speeds up development. Visual Studio is a program that does this.  However, when it comes to executing the program that you are actually coding, hyper threading does not really help unless you are developing an application that takes advantage of multiple threads.
If you want something cheaper, with great color reproduction and a beautiful design, take a look at the ASUS MX279H. It retails for around $350 in the US. I own the smaller 23" version, the MX239H and it is a beautiful panel. The color is great with a relatively low response time of 5ms. It is one of the best matte screen coatings I have seen. The only problem with it is that the stand cannot be adjusted in height and it doesn't have a standard VESA mount.  If you want a professional grade monitor, look no further than the ASUS ProArt PA279Q. It is calibrated for the perfect color reproduction in factory to be 99% Adobe RGB and 100% SRGB compliant. It also is higher resolution than the MX279H (which is 1080p) at 1440p. The ProArt costs almost $1000.
If you are using this drive for larger network it would be better for you to use the WD Red Pro because it suffice the needs of a larger group unlike the WD Red it is only design for smaller networks.   But WD Red is a reflection of the most extensive NAS partner compatibility- testing list that is available on the market.* That means when you buy a NAS enclosure, you can trust that WD Red will be the most compatible drive available.  Other hand, NAS for Big Business. Increase the efficiency and productivity of your business with WD Red Pro hard drives for your 8 to 16 bay NAS system. WD Red Pro comes equipped with NASware 3.0, which increases system compatibility allowing for seamless integration with your existing network infrastructure. Add value to your business by enabling your employees to quickly share their files and back up folders reliably with WD Red Pro NAS hard drives in your NAS solution.  Edit:  Okay, the Red Pro will be much durable versus the Red. Why? Because it has already its feature that it said that it has a slightly better failure rate and based on your statement there is the Red Pro has a vibration protection and it is also Bay Shock Protection and a sensor that detects subtle shock. As per heat or power, you just need a good cooling system. You just have to keep in mind that maintaining proper air flow through your computer case is the better way to keep the heat at its lowest, please be reminded that heat can build up inside to temperatures far hotter than the ambient temperature of your room. You are comfortable, PC may not.  Of course heat is an issue that why I am saying that you are the one should maintain it, no matter how much heat your drive can produce. Provide it with good airflow outside and especially inside.
Now that that the Moto Z and Z Force have been reviewed, I can say I heartily recommend them.   On the inside, the have the exact same chipset as most of the other 2016 flagships, the Snapdragon 820. Thanks to its 4 core only CPU, it does not suffer the same overheating issues as the Snapdragon 810.  Meanwhile, as usual, the Motorola flagships are very close to stock Android, which reduces the lag issues associated with OEM skins like touchwiz.  Another nice feature of the Moto Z is the modularity. You can add on a projector case, battery or speaker, and there could be more accessories afterwards.   There are three main issues with the Moto Z:    It does not have a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack, which means audio has to go through the USB C port, and you won't be able to use your old headphones, if you have any. It has a relative small battery (2600 mAh and 3500 mAh) though how much that affects the battery life is uncertain.  It will be Verizon exclusive between July and September. This means a long wait for the phone if you're on another carrier or don't live in the US.    If any of those reasons is a deal-breaker, the HTC 10 is a good option.
I am addressing only this part of the question:  And how is PC-to-firewall different from firewall equipment and Windows firewall?  A hardware firewall offloads the work from the general purpose CPU that windows uses to a CPU that is specifically designed for processing large volumes of network traffic fast.  Windows firewall can block individual websites based on IP, but does not do SPI.  Also with as much as people encrypt these days SPI can not inspect much of the traffic without SSL terminator.  If you buy software for each PC many of the functions of a hardware solution can be emulated locally, but then each PC has to have faster hardware to accommodate the addition work load.  Also nasty root kits maybe able to hide from PC only solutions.  Think about it this way, a hardware solution is like going to a gourmet cake shop and buying a cake.  Only the best ingredients were purchased and a master cake chief, or whatever they are called, monitored the whole process.  They used all the correct tools, baked and baked it to perfection.  The point is you get to enjoy the cake with no effort on your part.  The software solution is like making the cake yourself.  You go to your local store buy all the ingredients took them home.  Now you will use whatever tools you have on hand to mix them together and bake.  You most likely use inferior ingredients and poor tools and the end result maybe just ok.  Then you still have to do the dishes, and throw away the rubbish.   When you are buying a hardware firewall, the vendor has (in an ideal world) hired a security experts to test the firewall and verify it has no known vulnerabilities.  Most of them update themselves and require very little hands on once they are properly configured.  The vendor assembled all the pieces for you and gave it to you in a convenient package.  The will also for a fee have people on staff to help you configure it or configure it for you depending on the contract you sign and the fee you pay.  In a software solution each part of it is like an ingredient that goes into a cake.  Each piece has to be individual managed, configured, and updated.  Just like our cake one bad ingredient spoils the whole thing.  The foundation is the OS which has to be kept current.  Then you have your basic firewall which again has to be configured and maintained.  Then the SPI package, antivirus, anti-malware, and etc.  Each packages has rules that need updating and the software itself has to be kept up to date.  However, instead of being sad you made a bad cake, you company is the news for the next major data breach, and now you have to spend 10's of thousand cleaning up the mess.  I am not saying rolling your own solution is impossible or undesirable I am only saying you need to be prepared to do all the work yourself and initially it will definitely cost more money especially in hours of labor.
While I haven't found any more actual products, there are a couple of Kickstarter campaigns I stumbled across:   MouLus - Started in January 2013 but failed to gain traction. gStick - Started in August 2013, generated great interest and raised a staggering $130k. Quite incredibly this project is still ongoing but from the updates it seems it has been a very bumpy ride. I gather, whether the device will ever materialise is anyone's guess.
I've not tried these personally - and as with any headphones, its a good idea to try any headphones for fit (tight headphones cause headaches) and sound quality if possible, but it sounds like considering your fear of EMF, you might want to consider a IR based unit. IR's basically the same technology used in remote controls, is line of sight, and its technology that's been in common use since the 70s.   Based off the models the wirecutter tried (and sadly, they didn't do a proper review on this, other than saying they weren't really into IR) and the reviews for the model on the amazon link the Sony MDR-IF245RK might be a model.  Most folks report that its comfortable, but you may need to check the cables you need. Since its IR, if you pick up a second unit, you can use the second headset with the same transmitter (which is handy for movies).  And while I'm personally skeptical of EMF 'sensitivity', I don't think anyone's ever complained of IR sensitivity yet.
There is a IPC2 (Intense PC) mini PC (and similar) which comes with 4th/5th generation of IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7 Processors and it is compatible with with Linux and Windows.  Please check the product page at fit-pc.com about IPC2.  There is also fit-PC4 which is based on AMD G-Series APU (3 times the performance of the previous fit-PC3).  It's available in Amazon (UK) or can be ordered directly from the CompuLabâ€™s website.  For more details, check also the Wikipedia fit-PC page.
I would recommend the Nvidia Geforce GTX 960. It is around $250 and is one of the best budget cards. It has either 2GB or 4GB of VRAM, if you are just running 1 or 2 1080p monitors are do not do anything VRAM intensive (e.g. run song really VRAM demanding games, render videos in 4K, run virtual machines), then the 2GB is enough. If you do run more than 2 1080p monitors or 4K monitors, then the 4GB VRAM option is better.
Disclaimer: I am in no way involved with the company I am about to recommend, nor did I ever buy any of their systems. But I was considering to and have read good recensions about them in german IT magazines:  http://www.deltatronic.de/de/willkommen/nur-luefterlos  http://www.deltatronic.de/en/welcome/only-fanless  "no any fans" should be covered as they do not use fans neither on CPU, nor PSU nor the chassis. The configurations offered should be within your budget.  I also offer another link http://www.ichbinleise.de/ - a company I know nothing about, but they seem to offer the same products based on the same design principles.
The Macbook Pro   The 13 inch MBP fulfills most of your requirements in certain configurations, except for the ethernet port, which none of them have anymore, but can of course be realized with a Thunderbolt - Ethernet adapter. No need to talk about the business look. For simplicity, I'm going to list what it does NOT fulfill:   Dedicated GPU: It only features the Iris 6100, which is still fine for not so heavy Games, like League of Legends or similar. Ethernet: This is something Apple doesn't do anymore on their Macbooks. I also would like to see them back, but not going to happen, due to their strong emphasis on making the Macbooks as thing is possible. Help/Fix: Thunderbolt - Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.  Built in mobile internet: You would have to go for a USB LTE Stick. Or way better: Use your Phone for Tethering! Built in optical drive: You would have to go for an external Drive.
I have the i5 6600K as well in my Gaming Rig.   I went for a GTX 970, and paid 285 Euro in December 2015. However, I've seen this card last week for 212 Euro.   So right now, I definitely would wait, namely for the new AMD 480. Wait until some benchmarks have been made, and until the consensus says that it is a solid card. They announced it in the US for 200$, and what they claim seems seriously promising.
Under $250 GPU options as of 6/14/16  If you are willing to wait:   Nvidia - GTX 1060 - You mentioned this specifically, so I'm placing it ahead of the 480X. This card is rumored to be priced between $200-250 and is expected between late Summer and Fall of this year. It should perform slightly over the 480X, though everything is speculation at this point. AMD - Radeon 480X - These will be released at the end of the month with a $199 price point. The performance should place this card in line with a GTX 970 / Radeon 390X. There are numerous benchmarks available supposedly showing this card, but many of these are purely synthetic such as 3DMark, so it is possible that they may perform slightly better or worse in actual games.   If you need to buy a card today:   Your best option for performance per/$ right now will be used from eBay - there you can pickup a GTX 970 for under $200 without much hunting. I have had good luck with hardware on eBay. It may seem like a gamble but, from experience, I can tell you that eBay will forcibly refund your money from the seller in the event that they are dishonest and try to pass off dead hardware (this has happened to me once). Alternatively, you can check out some of the larger hardware forums and look at their Buy/Sell sections (examples: HardOCP forums, Overclock.net, many others). These sites typically require the seller to be a user with X posts/rep, meaning that the GPUs for sale are as described and shipped/packaged safely.
I would hold off on the GTX 950, it is going to give you almost identical performance to what you are getting now with the GTX 660. For GTA V on your 660, you should be able to get around 60fps with a mix of medium/high settings.  If you want to stick with Nvidia, you may want to wait until later this year (late Summer or Fall) when the GTX 1060 is released. If you're willing try AMD, the Radeon 480x will be available in a few weeks and should have performance similar to a GTX 970.
As Cfinley noted, there is no benefit to matching GPU and motherboard manufacturer parts. Since you were looking at MSI and ASUS boards, I specifically looked at those two manufacturers. I think the ASUS Z97-E would meet everything you are looking for, remain under your budget (currently has a mail-in rebate as well), and be a bit more future-proof than the ASUS Z97-P you had found as it also includes USB 3.1. Also, the motherboard is black with white lettering and gold/yellow trim pieces.  Heres the direct link to it on Newegg: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813132512  Worth mentioning, there are boards with more features such as additional PCIe slots, more USB 3.0 ports, and better onboard audio available for a little more ($140+). If you want to go this route there are several decent options from MSI, Gigabyte, Asus, and ASRock available. However, since you mentioned you only plan on having GPU, you could get a PCIe sound card for much better audio whenever your budget allows for it in the future.
Look at the HP elite display models. I have 3 of them, they all go from portrait/landscape with a spin of the hand and I love them for work. The bezels are a little under an inch wide, but if you overlap the screens its acceptable.   I have two different models, they are great for productivity. I usually have them in a sideways T configuration, but if I really want to get the most screen real estate nothing beats the H.
The Surface Book actually supports UHS-II from what I have seen. I think the Lexar Professional 2000x Series UHS-II/U3 of SD cards should fit your needs.   For a bit more, you can also get a 128gb from Lexar in the same series. If price is a bit too extravagant for your management, the SanDisk Extreme Pro (UHS-II) is available for a slightly cheaper in a 64gb site, although it is slower.      Per a customer review on that amazon page for the Lexar card:         Lexar Professional 2000x 300MB/s UHS-II 32GB: 296.5 read / 272.6 write   SanDisk Extreme Pro 280MB/s UHS-II 32GB: 274.5 read / 226.9 write   Toshiba Exceria Pro 260MB/s UHS-II 32GB: 260.5 read / 235.6 write
One of the few places where you can't go wrong with dell is their monitors. I don't own this specific model, but I can attest to them having excellent build quality  The Dell 2417H is probably what you should be looking at, no pun intended. Dell lists them at GBP 245 on their website (with a discount), but you probably can comparison shop.  These are really small bezels, IPS (and which ensures awesome viewing angles and great colour quality). They're 1080p.     It does HDMI and DP only (but there's simple converters for DVI, or even VGA should the need arise).  Dell probably makes the best monitor stands on the market. They sell a dual monitor stand if that's what floats your boat. The standard stands give you height, tilt, and rotation adjustments, though this seems a new design. If you want to vesa mount them, they're compatible with the 100mm standard.   I'm not bothering to list out which requirements of yours they meet, cause they meet all of them. Right down to the lack of speakers. These are probably the monitors you want
What are main differences compared to building a desktop ?    There isn't much differences between servers and desktops. For instance, Xeon CPUs are not always better than "simple" standards i7 (for instance, the Intel Core i7-6800K is a bit better than the E5-1620 and cost only 440$). But, they are designed to be able to run on a multi-CPU configuration. So if multi-CPU is what you are looking for, yes go on Xeon. The E5-1620 is kind of old now, why not consider going for E5-2640 v3? Less expensive and a bit better.     Can I do without for instance a GPU?   Becareful, Xeon processors do not embed IGP (like other Core iX does). So no, if you go for Xeon, you'll need a GPU. As said benjamin moskovits, if you goal is a database, just take the less expensive and it will do the job. Something like Nvidia Geforce GT740 should be ok.     Does a motherboard supporting 2 CPU's and 16 RAM slots require me to fill both CPU's to be able to use the full RAM ?    This is an interesting question and I really don't know (even if I'd say that yes, it can). But why bother using a 2sockets motherboard if you do not us them?     Any recommendations as to replace parts by cheaper, but performance wise similar products ?   I noticed two things:   As a general advice, do not go for low cost/value select RAM. Especially for some kind of critical use (I guess) such as a server. Valueselect tends to fail more quickly than other. I can see that you intend to use watercooling. From my experience, the extra-cost of watercooling isn't worse it. You'd better save the money for better high-end standard CPU fans.
An OS will be running on the card; so I need short access times, and it seems that microSDs are better than any standard SD in that respect.  I will give the SanDisk Extreme PRO microSD 64GB a chance (read access min/max/avg: 0.24ms/1.33ms/0.61ms; write access 1.18ms/80.02ms/1.69ms) and put it into a Bosvision adapter (https://www.amazon.com//dp/B01AT7ECA2  https://www.amazon.co.uk//dp/B01D5UEX9K / https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01D5UEX9K)
It does not look like there are any companies currently making a USB-to-wifi print server that supports ESC/P. Viewsonic made one years ago (model WPS-100), but it only supported wireless G and its configuration software was made for Windows XP. In other words, even if you could track one of these down, it would likely have compatibility issues.  Alternatively, if you have a printer with ethernet access, you can get a wireless access point and set it to bridge mode. After this access point is configured in bridge mode you'll be able to plug an ethernet cable between your printer and the access point. At this point your printer should be available on your wireless network.
Does the Roccat Tyon suits you? A bit more expensive that what you've asked (~65â‚¬) but:   16 buttons From my experience, it's a really good mouse   http://www.roccat.org/fr-FR/Products/Gaming-Mice/Tyon/
Moto G 2015 is (slightly) less bigger than the Nexus5 and is able to run 6.0. Lenovo K5 could also be an alternative.  I also found this: Samsung Galaxy Xcover 3: http://gadgets.ndtv.com/samsung-galaxy-xcover-3-value-edition-3446 Which is 4.5",  Android 6.0, LTE, only 8GB (but extendable with SD card, which with android 6.0 is a lot more interesting than before)
I think you should take a look at used workstation laptops made just before the XP support dropped off, maybe circa-2013. Since you are already familiar with high-end HP, I suggest looking for a used 8570w or 8770w. There appears to be a full set of 64bit XP drivers available (8570w - Windows XP 64bit drivers). There are dual core and quad core variants of this laptop, with the dual core supporting 16gb of memory and the quad supporting 32gb. The wireless card is an Intel Ultimate-N 6300 which does have a Windows XP 64bit dirver. The supported i5 and i7 processors are 3rd generation / Ivy bridge, but you will still have much better performance versus the Dell Inspiron you mentioned.
Your colleagues may have a quadcore in their Laptops, but one each only. HavenÂ´t seen a laptop with two CPUs yet. ThatÂ´s what you have MultiCore for nowadays.  See more detailed info at https://superuser.com/questions/906539/is-using-multiple-cpus-possible-in-a-laptop (see CoretoolÂ´s answer) and https://www.quora.com/Personal-computers-Dual-processors-Why-doesnt-a-PC-have-a-CPU-dedicated-to-the-user#  But I found that there is a laptop with two CPUs: The Asus Transformer Book Trio has an Intel i7 for Windows and an Intel Atom for Android.
It is not possible to run 2 x i7 because they are consumer grade CPUs and do not support multi CPU configurations. I do not believe there is a laptop that can simultaneously use 2 CPUs at once because of power and thermal limitations.  You should look into mobile workstations that feature either an Xeon or an i7 Extreme edition CPU with at least 16GB of RAM. The Lenovo ThinkPad P50 is a great choice with an Xeon CPU and up to 64GB of RAM (I recommend 32GB). It is also pretty affordable with the 32GB ECC RAM and Xeon E3 and Nvidia Quadro version only around $2,500.
All the laptops I know that already have an SSD built in are 1000â‚¬ and above; so if you want to get below that, you will most probably have to replace the HDD yourself, which will add 60 to 80 Euros to the price for 250GB. Make sure you get a 7mm drive!  According to Chip Magazine, the Acer Aspire E5-571-316T has the best battery for low budget laptops. It costs around 400â‚¬, has about 12 hours of battery working with office, 8.5 hours watching video, but has 15" and weighs 2.3kg. Video for replacing the HDD (and more)  Acer Aspire ES1-331-C8XF is a just a bit less expensive and also comes with no SSD has "only" 9 hrs/6 hrs of battery, but with 13" it only weighs 1.5kg. Replacing the HDD.
Because I feel that some people may be unsatiesfied with Thomas' recommendation of the Gemalto IDPrime Cards, I wanted to give another option here:  The Smartcard-HSM   It offers 1024-2048-bit RSA or up to 320-bit ECC with all NIST and Brainpool curves being pre-loaded and may even support custom curves (although I've got no source for this right now) It supports ECDSA and RSA signatures and allows for SHA-1 based on-card hashing (ECDSA) and for SHA1 /-256 /-384 /-512 based RSA pre-hashing ("PKCS", may be PKCS#1 v1.5) The operating system is CC EAL5+ certified, the chip platform is only EAL2+, the TOE can be found here It ships as a standard card form factor (contact, contactless and dual-interface), as micro SD with secure element and 1GB normal memory and as USB-token The only reseller at the moment is card-o-matic, individual cards will be around 20â‚¬ a piece, the tokens will be at around 80â‚¬ and more Driver support is available via OpenSC, supporting Windows CAPI and PKCS#11, the device driver (for Windows) is delivered extra and requires disabling driver signature checks for the installation though, the OpenSC PKCS#11 library has its limitations though, for example only one application can access the token at the same time If you have initialized the card with a specific key (called device-key-encryption-key (DKEK)) then you will be able to make key-backups off-card, otherwise not   TL;DR: It may be a bit expensive and a bit unconvenient from time-to-time, and somewhat limited in security level, but if backups, brainpool and / or high CC certification are what you're looking for, this may be the right choice.
I recommend the TPLINK AC1750 ARCHER D7, INR 8,529.00 and free shipping from Amazon.in. The CNET.au review shows that it has a real throughput of more than 300 Mbps total. However, much of this bandwidth comes over the 5 GHz band, so you still might require your old router for extra range (run a Ethernet cable across)  It integrates a ADSL 2+ modem, as required, and should be able to cover most of your property.
Maybe some further google searching could find a few more results, but it seems chiclet keyboards with RGB LEDs are few and far between.  I did however find this Steelseries https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-350, it might not be what your are looking for exactly, but it is low profile, RGB, and not mechanical.  Not sure if cheaper than the Razer.
I would recommend the Lenovo ThinkPad E560 with at least an i5 and 8GB of RAM. It has an 15.6" 1080p display and 256GB of SSD storage for around $1000. It also has Lenovo OneLink, which is their docking station that can provide you with 2 x USB ports, 1 x Ethernet, 1 x HDMI and an additional hard drive.
The HP Stream 14 uses the A4 Micro-6400T APU, which is passively cooled. It is already discontinued, but it can still be found on some sites. It is quite limited in performance and storage, but it is the only one passive AMD laptop I have found (and I have been looking for quite a while).
AMD Fury X  It has the ports, its kind of passive cooled.. comes with a built in AIO cooler. Cheap is a relative term. The fury x is around 600$, but I'm sure there are cheaper models.   So I'm a nvidia guy, and I don't have a way of testing it but I'm sure my 970gtx can push 2x 4k office sessions. And that gpu is only 300$ It's currently pushing 3 1080p displays without so much as breaking a sweat during gaming. If you like to join forces with the green team, there are plenty of options over here.
Yes this feature is offered, as for a remote option, I'm not sure.    I owned a Panasonic Viera TC-65AX800U, which was purchased in 2014.  It was a 65" 4K LED model.  This option was located in a separate "Format" sub-menu, not the main picture options menu (contrast, brightness, etc).  I've owned many TV's over the last 10 years or so, and this is the only one that had it.  The others were LG, Visio, another Panasonic, and Samsung.
They probably don't exist. Nearly all dual processor systems are xeon e5s or e7s using sockets like LGA2011 or LGA1567. Your pentiums use LGA 115x sockets. Since many chipset functions are rolled into the processor, you can't even get a chipset that would work here.  The only 'consumer' dual processor boards intel has made are skull trail, in 2008 and used a special processor that was using the same socket as contemporary xeons.   In short, there's no low cost, dual socket board. You might just choose to use the budget on a more powerful single socket either with more cores, or better clock speed.
I own a Samsung JU6050 which offers this feature.  However it does not have a button on the remote, but maybe I just don't know it has. This TV also offers smart features like youtube, which makes this option quite usable. However in my opinion the menu reacts quite slow, but it never crashed or so. It just needs some time.  Maybe the higher end models of Samsung offer this feature to and react faster.
Gaming generally benefits from faster single core but VM benefits from multiple cores. If you are planning to run less than 4 ish VMs then the i5 6500K will be a better choice (of course you will have to change your motherboard as well).  That SSD is cheap, a little too cheap. Go with some reputable brand to get performance and quality (such as Samsung, AData, Patriot, Sandisk, etc.). You could also take a look at having a smaller SSD for boot and a hard drive for your games and other files.   Your motherboard comes with an ethernet port so unless you are going to use multiple IPs or aggregate the connection you don't need the ethernet card. Your motherboard is a mATX motherboard, which is smaller than the regular ATX size. This fits in your case but you lose the extra PCIe ports you could get from an ATX board.  You might also want to take a look at a CPU cooler like the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo (bare minimum) because the CPU runs quite hot and the stock cooler isn't that great.  Everything else looks fine, GPU is powerful enough and PSU delivers enough wattage.
As far as raw speed is concerned, the Samsung EVO is the way to go. The drives themselves are very reliable and have the faster read (540mb/s) and write (520mb/s) speeds.   I myself have a Samsung EVO and it works flawlessly in my PC. In my PS4... well I haven't tried it in there.   Some people claim its a bad idea, and that you won't see any difference in speed with the use of an SSD due to hardware limitations of the PS4; they claim that an SSHD is a better call for this sort of upgrade. You can read about that here.   On the other hand, this gentlemen here saw a large difference in speed with some games (check out the tables he created with load time comparisons).   My advice would be: if you see value in the upgrade to an SSD based on the sources I've provided, go for it.   If you were expecting an SSD to cut your load times in half across the board, either temper your expectations, or save some money and get yourself an SSHD.
Since you have 2 x GTX 670 in SLI, getting a GTX 1070 will not yield much performance benefits. Running SLI is never as good as running a faster, more expensive single card so I would recommend you to get a GTX 1080 (should be enough for what you are doing) and SLI it later if for some reason it is not powerful enough.
Most modern wifi adaptors should work with little issues. My goto spare 'it will certainly work' wifi adaptor's a generic no brand 802.11 n nano adaptor - a few dozen companies make em. They universally use the same, standard ralink chipset.  This is the specific one I have, and if you want a branded one Edimax's riff on the product is certain to work. Plug it in, reboot and it should be detected.  They work with most common linux distros, there's support in kernel for ubuntu and fedora at the very least. They're also crazy cheap  However these only support the 'last gen' 802.11n standard, at the lowest speed possible. They also only support the more common 2.4 ghz, which is sometimes congested.  It will certainly work with minimal configuration.
Use a tower styled CPU cooler (such as the Hyper 212 Evo) with some quiet fans running at very low RPMs (I recommend the Noctua NF-F12).  Use a GPU that has the fans completely OFF when under a certain temperature (such as the ASUS Strix line). Make sure your case has good airflow to ensure the GPU fans almost never run (i.e. place quiet fans for intake at the front and exhaust at the back).  Use a power supply with the fans completely OFF when under a certain temperature (I recommend Corsair AX, TX, HX, or RM series PSUs). Similarly, you must also guarantee good airflow in your case or the fan on the PSU will start spinning. Higher efficiency PSUs will create less heat (which equals less cooling required) and all PSUs are most efficient at around 50% load.
The Nvidia Quadro M5000 is a workstation grade GPU. It uses the same chip as the Titan X (a consumer grade card that costs around $1000) so it will perform about the same as the Titan X. The Quadro line is fully designed, manufactured and tested by Nvidia so it has very good compatibility with professional software. It costs around $2500 which is slightly over your budget but is a card you should look at.  The Nvidia Quadro M4000 is a tier below the M5000. It uses the same chip as the GTX 970 (which is around $350). It costs round $1000. If you got this I would recommend you to get 2 of them so you can run them independently and split the VMs between these two cards. This can be used as long as there is not single VM that require a insane amount of processing power.   You can also choose to use the consumer line of GPUs, I recommend getting 2 x Titan X if you need the extra VRAM but I would recommend 2 x GTX 1080 otherwise. You can run these in SLI if you want them to act as a single faster card or run them independently (I recommend this way).  If you want more performance, then go with the consumer GPUs. If you care more about stability and comparability, then go with the Quadro.
It's a bit tough finding exact decibel ratings on different hard drives, in general the dbA is not listed under the hard drive's specifications. But I did find one site where sound measurements were taken. The only issue is, it may be a little outdated (October 2014 was it's last update). But, if we assume that the manufacturers and model types are similar in sound to the ones on this page, it seems that Seagate Barracuda's make the least noise. There are also some other options if we go by the chart I linked to above, so if the Barracuda isn't a good fit, you could go by some of the other ones listed.   That being said, I also did find some HDD "silencers" which would effectively allow you to use any HDD you'd like, although it would take a little bit more fuss. I found a very nice looking one here. There are also other dampeners from the same site here.
You're going to want a raspberry pi or arduino to do this. I found this website  https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/temperature/  they take a 35$ raspberry pi, wire in a 5$ sensor and they were able to record temp readings.   Raspberry pi can connect to your network using wifi or ethernet. There are simple scripts that would tell your pi to text you every hour the current temp.     I hope this suggestion fits the bill, or at least leads in the right direction.
All of GL.iNet routers are based on OpenWRT.  You can get the GL-AR150 for $25 which is a pretty nice device with 16MB Flash ROM, 64MB RAM and 1 USB port.  Also, you could go for some cheap TP-LINK routers like TL-WR741N or TL-WR841N which have OpenWRT support.
The MOTO E 2015 (2nd edition) is a nice device with a 4.5" screen. Although the stock ROM is Android 5.1.1 you can currently install the latest CyanogenMod on it, which is based on Android 6.0.1.  Currently, the LTE version of this phone costs USD$ 83 on Amazon.  You can see a comparison of its size with Nexus 5 here.  129.8 * 66.8 * 12.2 mm
I don't have the reputation to make this a comment, but I can find at least one 2.5 inch 3TB (and 4TB) HDD: https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Laptop-2-5-Inch-Internal-ST3000LM016/dp/B01CHYIEXG . For your computer, I would recommend a motherboard with an embedded processor, such as the Celeron J-1900 which has a thermal design power of only 10 watts. You could save money on your power supply by getting a thin-mini ITX form-factor motherboard, in which an external power supply like ones seen in laptops plugs into the IO shield and is distributed through the motherboard. These usually have PCI-E slots into which you can plug a cheap RAID card.
While purchasing two cards may seem gnarly, it really wouldn't be better than a single 1080.   First, you won't have to fuss around with getting SLI to work properly. Not that its a massive pain, but it is a pain.  Second, some games do not even support SLI properly. Now this may not happen often, but imagine your shock when your $1000+ GPU setup won't play nice with certain games. (Don't get me wrong, I know most games support SLI, but this doesn't change the fact that there are some compatibility issues with certain games...)   Third, power consumption. It may not be a huge issue, but its another issue to stack on-top of the other issues that come with running two cards. (~150 watts per 970, vs ~250 for a single 1080)  Fourth, resale value. Not that you'll want to sell, but this is still something to think about.   Fifth, as far as numbers go, you're looking at about 20 percent more performance out of the 1080 for less work and you don't have to worry about all of issues that I've mentioned.   ...Now say... you want to run two 980 TI's in SLI... I'd have to reconsider my answer entirely at that point!   But if you want one takeaway:   Two 970's running in SLI are not better than one 1080.
This CPU is going to enable you to play low and midrange games well, including titles like:   League of Legends DOTA 2 CS:GO Portal 2 Borderlands 2 Rocket League   But not titles like:   Battlefield 4 Crysis 3 Civilization V (late-game) Assassin's Creed: Black Flag Satellite Reign   Because low and midrange games USUALLY don't require beefy GPUs either, it would be safe to combine this CPU with a GPU like the R7 360, GTX 750 ti, or similar. With these cards installed, the Intel HD graphics chip will be either disabled or used only to support additional monitors (and a precious few GPU-accelerated tasks, where its contribution will be miniscule in comparison to the dGPU's).   I would not try to game on it WHILE it was serving as a FreeNAS sever.
The best notebook I could find in this price-range with your requirements is probably the Lenovo 700Y (17-inch) series. While I don't own, it seems to fit your requirements quite well, as a medium- to high-end gamer laptop. Lenovo; NotebookCheck     Now let's go through the list of your requirements, shall we?     As I said, an SSD is a must. [...], so we'll say atleast 250 GB.   Obviously, more would be nice, though it's not necessary.   According to Lenovo's website there are options for 256GB or 512GB SSD and for 1TB HDD with 128GB SSD, so you're covered here.     A 6th-gen intel quad-core CPU. I'd like an I7 or higher, but I could   settle for an i5, provided it was still new, quad-core, and fairly   powerful.   The Y700 series only runs 45W Intel Core i-s, which are all (powerful) quad-core CPUs based on Skylake architecture. More concretely chances are you will be getting in i7-6700HQ or an i5-6300HQ (rarer).     I don't do anything demanding on the GPU, so as long as I can plug an   external 1080p monitor into it, that's good enough for me. Bonus   points if I can plug a second one in. (Though I might need a docking   station at that point)   You can at least plug-in one monitor via HDMI and can maybe connect a second via wireless Miracast, which the laptop should support.     I don't need an insane amount of RAM. [...] So 8   GB would probably be enough. (Although I'm certainly not against   having more)   The Y700 series has at least 8GB of RAM and you can also find models with 16GB.     This probably goes without saying, but it should have an 1/8th inch   headphone output and several USB 3 outputs.   It has that headphone output and two USB-3.0 ports and one USB-2.0 port. You may want to consider buying an USB-3.0 hub if you need more. (These numbers are fairly common for laptops nowadays sadly). The HW recommendation for this can be found here.    Now for your preferences:     Support for a docking station, if I want to upgrade peripherals down   the road.   Sadly there seems to be no proprietary connector for this model, however standard USB 3.0 docking stations probably can do the trick here.     [...]An   onboard ethernet cable would be really really nice. I could use an   adaptor or a docking station, but using onboard ethernet would be a   lot more convenient.   Again, sadly it looks like Ethernet on the laptop seems to be less of a thing nowadays than it used to be (due to the improved WLAN technology), but you can still get yourself a small little USB-3.0-Ethernet connector (Anker also has those).     I'm not really a laptop connisuier, so there are a lot of things that   I either don't really care about or don't know how to quantifiy. For   example, I have no idea what a good-battery life would be. I'd like a   good battery-life, but I don't commute, or have any reason to need a   really good one. I also couldn't tell a good one from a bad one.   Lenovo claims 4-5 hours for this one, but chances are you'll have to live with 2-3 hours there if you actually do stuff with it.     I'm also not super picky when it comes to things like screen size or   weight. (Also don't know how to quantify) I don't want something on   either extreme (Such as a chromebook or a giant luggable). A 1080p   display (or higher if I can get it at this price) would be preferred.   There are variants of the Y700 series for 15" and for 17" (this answer is about the 17" ones), but at least the 17" ones all do feature 1080p screens.     I will be able to use the laptop on my own time, so a gpu (or   integrated graphics) strong enough for very light gaming would be   nice. I already have a computer that can handle pretty much any game,   so this is certainly not a requirement.   The Y700s are originally intended as gamer laptops, so this should be not so much of a problem.     Good linux support would also be a plus.   I don't think it has extraordinary Linux support, but it should do the job.    Finally for your neutral points:     While looking around on my own, I found that lot's of newer laptops in   this price range have touchscreens. I am almost completely neutral on   a touchscreen. If it could be cheaper without, I'd go with the cheaper   one. If they're the same price, I guess I'd go for the touchscreen. I   probably wouldn't end up using it very much though.   The Y700 series does not feature touch-screens, as a gaming laptop series.     I don't really care which version of windows it comes with. It would   be nice if it comes with 7 already installed, but if it comes with 8   or 10, I'll just reinstall 7 anyway. (I already have a license and a   CD and all that)   It comes with Windows 10 64-bit pre-installed.     I don't really care about an optical drive (or lack thereof)   I couldn't exactly tell, but at least some models don't feature optical drives.
HDR has been around for a while now but the technology is still in its infancy. You will see HDR TV's, but monitors are much harder to come by. Also, there is relatively little HDR content. It's going to be a rough transition, as sRGB is the standard, and until the conversion is made simple, or a shift is made to start producing content in this format, you won't see much in HDR.    That bit in italics is more of an opinion. But anyway, here are the facts.   HDR screens:   use 10 bit per channel instead of 8 bit.  are about 4 times brighter than current screens use the Rec.2020 instead of sRGB or Rec.709.   Right now you can find 4K monitors, but they do not support the wide color gamut which HDR allows. You will not see HDR in monitors until later next year at the earliest is my guess based on what we've seen so far. AMD is still busy showing off the tech, and its going to take some serious paradigm shifting for everything to support HDR. It's a whole new playing field in a sense, and EVERYTHING (your OS, the way content is produced, the way your games are created) will have to make the shift to HDR.  The long and short of it, you're going to have to wait until at least 2017 to see 4K HDR Monitors at the consumer level (you can buy the TV's now), and you're going to be waiting even longer for content that properly utilizes HDR technology.
I think they just made a new keyboard for that series of products. If you look at Cherry Americas website you can find a G80-3000 MX, which looks really similar to the product you said. But if you want that specific product you can easily find it on Amazon, as I already did.
ASUS VivoBook E403SA-US21   Quad Core Pentium on latest process sips power and delivers performance SSD allows efficient and fast operation, large enough to dual boot if you need a linux on there Windows 10 delivers good power-savings and compatibilty 4gb RAM good enough for low-intensity programs and mild multitasking 14" screen - it's a lil' guy.   Looks like people are claiming it lasts ~14 hours on a charge, which would be impressive if true.
I'm gonna go with the following recommendation list, including the mobo, to show you how I imagine it fitting into a situation like the one you're seeing:  PCPartPicker part list: http://pcpartpicker.com/list/8nn4Cy Price breakdown by merchant: http://pcpartpicker.com/list/8nn4Cy/by_merchant/   CPU: AMD A10-7890K 4.1GHz Quad-Core Processor  ($148.99 @ Amazon)  Motherboard: ASRock FM2A88X Extreme6+ ATX FM2+ Motherboard  ($99.99 @ SuperBiiz)   Memory: PNY Anarchy 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-2400 Memory  ($34.99 @ Amazon)   Case: Silverstone GD09B HTPC Case  ($72.99 @ SuperBiiz)   Wireless Network Adapter: Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I PCI-Express x1 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Adapter  ($29.99 @ SuperBiiz)   Total: $386.95 Prices include shipping, taxes, and discounts when available Generated by PCPartPicker 2016-07-01 16:22 EDT-0400  Basically the takeaways here are:    APU comes with decent GPU w/ VCE decoder for streaming, no need to spend on separate dGPU. mobo features DisplayPort addon BT+AC capability 7.1ch sound APU comes with quiet cooler stock Case is quiet and livingroom-oriented 16gb RAM is a possibility with upgrades fullsize dGPU can later be added USB requirements met Storage requirements met Cost requirements met UEFI support requirements met   Basically the only downside as I see it is unfortunate AMD driver support in linux (SteamOS), but as a dGPU can be added later this is not a showstopper the way I see it.
One alternative would be to use an internal Ethernet add-on card. It's a lot better than the USB solution usually...  One (very cheap) example: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA5M11TB9358  Advantages to other solutions:   works with most motherboards better speed than USB 2.0 options doesn't take up any USB 3.0 ports cheaper than many alternatives   It has better bandwidth and reliability than the USB options suggested earlier, and it can be cheaply added to ANY motherboard someone else suggests as the solution, which allows total overall cost to be much lower (given that 2x ethernet port motherboards are indeed generally expensive). With an adapter like this, almost any motherboard that supports his chosen CPU will work just fine for your purposes.
On further research I found several claims that 3.5" 7200rpm drives are a lot harder to keep quiet than sub-6000rpm drives, and that there is no longer a significant performance benefit from the higher platter speed (I suppose because data density is so high that the linear speed under the head is no longer a limiting factor?).  So I expanded my search to 5900rpm drives and found an $80 Toshiba DT01ABA300V that includes "low acoustics" under its design features.  I put it in my chassis and have been running it for a few days and haven't heard a thing.  So for quiet this does the trick!  (How is its R/W performance?  Well I use a SSD for O/S and programs, so I don't know if I would notice even if it were markedly deficient....)
A Newegg tech advisor noted that Asus and Lenovo case designs tend to be pretty quiet.  Rather than build I decided this time to buy a Lenovo 300-20ish on sale, which was actually cheaper than building an equivalent system.  Been a while since I've bought a finished desktop, but it's a really neat little tower, and it's quieter than any other computers I use.  As Peter noted, keys to silence are, foremost, to keep fans off or slow.  This system is built around a 65W CPU, and I haven't (yet) put a power-hungry GPU in there (I realized I can run 4k off the MB's HDMI).  So the PSU and CPU fans aren't going crazy, I put a quiet spinning disk inside along with the primary SSD, and it's just quiet all the time!  (Except, of course, when I'm using the optical drive.)
There are several things to consider when purchasing a PSU, but here are the most important:   Does it have enough wattage to support my components and any upgrades I might want in the future? Is it made by a reliable company and is it made with quality components? What is its power efficiency? (How effectively it converts the power from your outlet) Does it have enough cables or sockets to support any future upgrades I might want?   There are obviously aesthetic requirements as well, like whether it's modular, whether the color will match your build, and sometimes special lighting.  That said, picking a PSU is one of the easiest components to choose. Here's the one I went with on my recent build, with a 6700k and a 1070: EVGA SuperNOVA 750 B1 80+ BRONZE, 750W. This unit has more wattage than I currently need but it leaves room for upgrades in the future.  EVGA is a reputable brand, this unit has great reviews, and it's relatively cheap. My only complaint with it is the mesh surrounding the cables don't completely block the colors of the cables inside, but that's not noticeable once it's in the case.   If money isn't a concern, go with something fully modular with lots of plugs, and higher power efficiency, like this: EVGA SuperNOVA 750 G2 80+ GOLD.
To answer your question about recording, recent NVidia cards have a feature called ShadowPlay that can record games using a chip in the card independently of the CPU and the rest of the GPU, meaning next to no performance impact on games and computer usage. ShadowPlay is capable of both recording and streaming in 1080P at 60 FPS.  The limiting factor for recording on a 970 is more likely to be your HDD or SSD. It's strongly recommended to record to a second HDD, apart from the disk where Windows and the game is installed, to avoid the disk from being overloaded.  However, in response to whether the 970 is good enough; the GTX 1060 will be released soon (sources say the 14th of July) which will most likely offer performance improvements over the 970. I strongly recommend waiting until then before making a decision and buying the 970.  As to whether the 970 is powerful enough to run the latest games at ultra settings, that's a matter of the game. Games like The Witcher 3 are very graphically intensive and can't be run with high FPS on the 970.   Without knowing the specific games you're interested in playing, it's best to look up user experiences for the card and game you're interested in.  Edit: This article says the GTX 1060 will rival the performance of a 980, so again, I strongly recommend waiting.
You can look at Ubiquiti's EdgeMAX line. Don't be fooled by the size and price, it is a very capable device. It can run standard IPsec and you can also install OpenVPN on it.  I have used OpenVPN for Windows and Unix machines with good results.
For a recent vacation, involving multiple connecting flights, rental cars, hotel rooms and hiking, I bought the relatively cheap JLab JBuddies headphones for my children for less than $20 each.     A couple notes:   The over the ear component is small. It definitely wouldn't feel comfortable on my ears. I'm not sure about pre-teen, but for young elementary school it works great. They fold up and are compact, which was great for traveling and storage They have a standard mini-jack and work great on the tablets Built in maximum volume limiter These survived being stuffed in backpacks by less than careful children, tossed around various hotel rooms, cars and airplane storage locations. The cords were not gently wrapped up after each usage and generally treated as I'd expect younger children to treat electronics when I don't glare at them to not break something. They survived all of that.
I just took the most inexpensive computer I could find (â‚¬300 without an OS), and had no severe problems over the past 3.5 years. Use it as a development web server; on travels also as office computer.    IÂ´ts an Asus K53U   15" wide screen glare display, full keyboard, Ethernet and WLAN g, a Kensington Lock, SD slot, 3*USB, VGA and HDMI output, DVD writer not too loud or heavy, and itÂ´s a breeze to exchange hardware components. innards: AMD Fusion C50 (a little slower than an i3, but best performance per Watt), 2 GB RAM and a decent battery. The machine sometimes freezes for a minute or so when I open too many tabs in Firefox and have Kruzader running, but thatÂ´s about it. Not a single emergency boot in all the time.   The machine even survived a few (physical) crashes:   life-hacked the power socket (after a 4ft drop to a stone floor) replaced the HDD with an SSD in no time (after the same drop) only the new DVD drive doesÂ´t really fit into the case; keeps popping open from time to time. (Yup: I actually killed my coffee cup holder.)
No.  This is because the mount points for the screws are different:    It's unclear exactly why you want a higher airflow in your machine, however I suspect you want to cool the machine down quicker/more efficiently, in order to fix temperature issues. Even if a higher CFM fan did exist for your model, it is unlikely that it would be supported in your model's revision as higher CFM fans will use more power (that the specific revision of the model might not be able to provide).  Therefore to (partially) fix your temperature issues a laptop cooling pad may be better suited for your situation, as:   It has its own fans built-in that attach to a USB port of your machine; They are relatively inexpensive; It may last longer than the life of your current machine (you may be able to use it for your next laptop)
Either of these options will improve your performance significantly. The i7-2600K gives you the Intel HD 3000 on-board graphics, and both of these cards outperform the functionalities of the Intel HD 3000 pretty significantly. As far as rendering is concerned, I had to do a bit of research, but for your purposes either of these units would improve your performance quite a bit.   Prior to Cycles Render, the GPU didn't really matter, it was all about having a beefy processor. Now, that Cycles puts the GPU to good use, buying a GPU for Cycles Rendering is a fantastic idea.   Now, as far as which GPU of those two to purchase, what you really want is a good chunk of graphics memory. Out of the two you listed, the GTX 950 would be my choice, although you get the same amount of memory, it is a newer card, and it brings with it all the features of a newer card.   From what I've read, 2GB seems to be more than sufficient for most people. That being said, a wise recommendation would be to download GPU-Z, render a scene, and see how much VRAM it takes to render. This will give you a better approximation of exactly what you need.   All in all, yes a GPU will increase your performance significantly, and the more VRAM you have, the better your performance when it comes to rendering with Cycles. CUDA is the preferred over OpenCL, making Nvidia cards the best choice. Of the two you listed, I would go with the GTX 950, which has a performance edge over the GTX 750 TI. If you're looking to save some money though, the 750 will still give you a significant boost in render speed.

You are looking for a ATX case. I have a few suggestions for you. Consider the LIAN LI PC-A05FNB or the Antec Sonata Series SOLO II.  For comparision I have listed the Fractal Design Define R5, which is my favorite case. However, it is too large for your requirements ("but dont to be very big outside"). It's dimensions are 17.76" x 9.13" x 20.51". You seem to want something smaller.  Three smaller cases are listed below. I only have experience with the Antec Sonata Series SOLO II. It's an older design, and it is missing some of the touches found in the R5, but it is a good quality case and it seems to be about the size you are seeking.  However, the LIAN LI PC-A05FNB has very positive reviews. It is worth considering.  The very smallest ATX case I know is the Cooler Master Elite 361. I have not used it. I think it is a older design, also probably lacking the modern features of the R5.  The Pros and Cons below are all from NewEgg reviews. (I summarized.)  Fractal Design Define R5 Blackout Window Silent ATX Midtower Computer Case   http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16811352057 5 stars, 23 reviews $109.99 Pros: very popular quiet case; excellent build quality; well thought out design elements; great value. Cons: not a compact, small case (for those looking for something compact) Dimensions (H x W x D):   18.19" x 9.13" x 20.91" with feet/screws/protrusions 17.76" x 9.13" x 20.51" Weight: 22.69 lbs.    Cooler Master Elite 361 - Mid Tower Computer Case with Rotatable Logo for Vertical or Horizontal Placement    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119262 4 stars, 17 reviews Pros: Great size if you need something compact with full atx. Can fit a moderately large GPU in the case. Cons: Can't fit any tall cpu coolers in this case. May be too small for many builds. Dimensions (H x W x D):  14.40" x 5.90" x 18.20" Weight: 10.60 lbs.    Antec Sonata Series SOLO II Black Aluminum / Steel ATX Mid Tower Computer Case    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811129177 4 stars, 53 reviews $119.99 Compact, good quality; not on the same level as the R5, but better than most cases I've used Dimensions (H x W x D):   18.50" x 8.10" x 17.30" Weight: 20.20 lbs.    LIAN LI PC-A05FNB Black Aluminum ATX Mid Tower Computer Case    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811112331 4 stars, 51 reviews $89.99 Pros: One of the best cases I've ever owned.  The front power supply position is an excellent use a space. Everything well thought out and designed. Beautiful finish. Cons: This case really can fit a full size ATX board, power supply and GPU, but it becomes a very tight fit when using full size parts. If you are patient then you can assemble this well even with full size parts. Just don't expect to open it up and tinker with it often! Dimensions (H x W x D)  19.69" x 8.27" x 15.16" Weight: 9.70 lbs.    UPDATE  I personally prefer Fractal Design cases. Here are three more possibilities to consider. Of these, the Core 2300 is the smallest. However, the Core line is their budget line. I haven't used any of these cases, but they may lack some of the high end features of the R5 (and R4).  ** Fractal Design Arc Midi R2 Black Window High-Airflow ATX Midtower Computer Case **   http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811352031 5 stars, 178 reviews $109.99 Tweaktown Must Have Editor's Choice Award Pros: "By far the best case I have ever bought, and I've purchased many different cases." Cons: only 2 external drive bays; heavy; SSD mount has to be placed before putting on your mobo Dimensions (H x W x D):  18.11" x 9.06" x 20.28" Weight:  23.59 lbs.    ** Fractal Design Define R4 Black Silent ATX Midtower Computer Case **   http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811352020 5 stars, 494 reviews $109.99 Pros: Very solidly built, lots of cable routing options. Despite its quiet design, there is still good airflow. "It's the best case i have used so far." Cons: "A little bigger than I expected" Dimensions (H x W x D)  18.27" x 9.13" x 20.59" Weight:  27.12 lbs.    ** Fractal Design Core 2300 Black Wide-body ATX Midtower Computer Case **   http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16811352042 4 stars, 11 reviews $69.99 Benchmark Review's Recommended Product Award A compact full-ATX case with bottom-mounted PSU, designed for exceptional airflow and cooling. Pros: "This is really a great case for a good price with a quality name behind it. The case is sturdy and well designed. Plenty of space for cable management and plenty of sources to tie down wires." Cons: Lower build quality than the R5; some claim flimsy; drive mounts are controversial Dimensions (W x H x D)  7.6 x 17.5 x 18.1 inches (195 x 445 x 460mm) Weight: 11.4 lbs (5.2kg)
I believe any i3 laptop should work with Ubuntu Ubuntu is not so demanding in system so find any cheap or even refurbished laptops on newegg bhphotvideo moneyexchange
A simple google would do:  https://www.amazon.com/Global-Marketing-Partners-FK205-Keyboard/dp/B000UZVL3K  Looks like a pretty decent one. Has a USB cable according to reviews and not made out of rubber
That graphics card is horribly underpowered for any modern game. I would advise you to get a newer/better one (such as a 750Ti). It would be better to just plug the monitor into the mainboard graphics plug, as even intel's integrated GPU will outperform the 8500 GT and might be able to play some modern games somewhat smoothly.  TL;DR: There is no way to get a reasonably modern game running smoothly on hardware released in 2007.  EDIT: If you downvoted, please explain why
Get something newer. Your card has 192-bit Memory Interface Width, and a memory bus that slow is not going to handle 3gb's of memory very efficiently, even with a single card. You would be in a much better position with a single 970 or 980. While the amount of VRAM might be greater with the two 760's, you won't see better performance than you would out of a single 970 or 980. And you'll also have to deal with the first four problems I list in this answer here. Let me quote myself:      First, you won't have to fuss around with getting SLI to work properly. Not that its a massive pain, but it is a pain.      Second, some games do not even support SLI properly. Now this may not happen often, but imagine your shock when your $1000+ GPU setup won't play nice with certain games. (Don't get me wrong, I know most games support SLI, but this doesn't change the fact that there are some compatibility issues with certain games...)       Third, power consumption. It may not be a huge issue, but its another issue to stack on-top of the other issues that come with running two cards. (~150 watts per 970, vs ~250 for a single 1080)      Fourth, resale value. Not that you'll want to sell, but this is still something to think about.    All of these issues apply directly to your situation as well. Except the power consumption would be slightly different for 760's vs 970's; but the same concept applies, you'll be drawing significantly more power.   You would also have to find a 760 3gb card, which would be tough to get new, so you would be stuck with used or refurb models off of eBay.  So all in all? Don't go for SLI, instead of searching for the same card, save your time, put more money up front and get yourself a GTX 970 or 980 (go Ti if you can!).

The G3258 is an unlocked processor on the 1150 socket, so it is not subject to all of the recent BIOS hubbub surrounding Intel's crackdown on overclocking non-K processors on the 1151 (Skylake) socket. As such, it is STILL THE CASE that you can overclock your G3258 on ANY 1150 motherboard with a BIOS that supports OCing, Windows 10 or not.  As such, I recommend the Gigabyte GA-H81M-H. It is a proven overclocker and is currently one of the cheapest boards available for the 1150 socket.
I have extensive experience with Blender and cycles.  The 750Ti is about 20% faster than your CPU. The 950 is about 100% faster than your CPU. (i.e. double the performance)  But currently GPUs render fur a lot slower than CPU, so take that into account if you work with a lot of fur.  With the CPU, you get the advantage of having access to all your system RAM (8GB, 16GB, etc). Whereas if you render with a 2GB GPU, it will not render a complex scene that requires more than 2GB RAM.  I would consider the 950, but not the 750Ti.  Source: GPU Benchmark, CPU Benchmark
Xeon and Opteron processors are the ONLY modern x86 processors on the market capable of running in tandem. All other CPU brands (Celeron, Pentium, Core iX, Sempron, Athlon, FX, AX) are incapable of running on tandem motherboards.   That being said, it would not be unreasonable to make an entry-level gaming PC based on the G1840 CPU. Because you are looking at the absolute cheapest CPU available on a modern socket, I am going to assume extreme budget constraint - you could do something like this, using SteamOS or Linux as your OS to get started with gaming:    CPU: Intel Celeron G1840 2.8GHz Dual-Core Processor  ($39.99 @ SuperBiiz)   Motherboard: Biostar B85MG Micro ATX LGA1150 Motherboard ($47.98 @ Newegg)   Memory: PNY Anarchy 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory ($23.98 @ Newegg)   Storage: Western Digital Caviar Blue 250GB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive ($22.25 @ Amazon)   Video Card: Zotac GeForce GTX 750 Ti 2GB Video Card  ($99.99 @ Newegg)   Case: DIYPC M89-R MicroATX Mini Tower Case  ($23.99 @ Newegg)   Power Supply: Raidmax 380W ATX Power Supply  ($19.99 @ SuperBiiz)  Total: $278.17   Alternatively, you might consider looking into an AMD APU option, as most of their A6, A8, and A10 desktop processors are vastly more powerful than the Celeron G1840, and come with integrated graphics that are actually useful for light gaming. For example, the A8-7600 is much faster than this Celeron on average, yet it also features an integrated GPU capable of comfortably handling games like CS:GO, League of Legends, or most Rocket League at high settings and framerates at 1080p.
Passmark is a better benchmark than that cpuboss, which basically just scrapes data from other sources.   As you can see in that lineup, paying close attention to the Single Thread rating, even AMD CPUs are substantially more powerful than the i7-920 today, and the i7-6700K absolutely annihilates both AMD's common offerings and the older i7-920.   Now, to address some of your other concerns, which may end up being much more important to you than just comparing the absolute performance numbers:  Hyperthreading is not always useful. What it does is allow a single CPU core to process two program "threads" simultaneously at a small hit to its overall performance. In situations where your workload can take advantage of parallel processing, adding threads can nearly double your performance. But in situations where your workload doesn't make use of more threads than cores on your CPU, hyperthreading will offer you NO speed advantages, and may in some edge cases result in LOWER performance. This is why Hyperthreading has seen limited adoption - it is no substitute for more cores and even then, many applications are not/cannot be parallelized.  Your workload leans heavily on RAM and disk performance - your CPU will probably not be the "bottleneck" in your system (the part everything has to wait on in order for work to get done). My guess, given that you have triple channel RAM, is that your bottleneck will be with storage - and this kind of puts you in a good position, because the upgrades I'm about to go over would be things you'd end up needing whether you upgraded your current system or moved to a whole new architecture.  In modern computers there are a wide variety of methods for speeding up disk read and write. I will go over the two options which make sense for you, using a desktop PC, assuming all data is local to that PC (not stored remotely on a network):   Tiered storage - you can use a combination of RAMDisks, SSDs, and HDDs to cache your storage, enabling chunks of your total dataset to be processed very quickly. This is a relatively simple solution to set up, and is limited only by the filesize you need to be working on at any given time, because RAM and SSDs are expensive storage solutions compared to HDDs and it can be prohibitively expensive to build a cache capable of storing terabytes of data all at once - it would be better to have, say, a 1gb RAMDisk cache paired with a 32gb SSD cache, managed by some cheap software like PrimoCache, moving files on and off your HDD array as needed. RAID - you can really speed up your HDD array by putting them behind some good, quality hardware RAID. Dropping an old SAS to SATA II MegaRAID controller into your PCI-E 16x slot could provide you with a way of creating a RAID0 or (ideally) RAID10 array that moves data with a small built-in RAMcache for dedicated writeback performance storage behavior. These older RAID controller cards can often be had on ebay for under $100, which can make it a more cost-effective option than building a working tiered storage system. It is harder to set up, though, requiring you to have a good understanding of how RAID levels work and how to set up your system to play nicely with the RAID array you end up creating.   Either of these options can be deployed into your old PC or a new replacement, but you'll probably want one or the other no matter which way you go.
I have a recommendation for you, I already have two (@home and @office) pretty good stuff. Available in black version too just search using that name. I also still enjoy the wired version. Depending on your location you can find that model in other countries too. If you want more real pictures just let me know. Hope that helps.

Are there any benchmark tests which compare older i7's to current i7's?    Cinebench (benchmarks) (6700k performs 72% better) 3DMark (benchmarks) (comparison1) (6700k performs 33% better) Passmark (comparison2) (6700k performs 122% better) Mixed Benchmarks by AnandTech (comparison) (6700k performs 85% better average)      I wonder why it is that CPU's are being manufactured without hyper-threading considering that technology has been around for quite some time.    Marketing It costs them money to add it Demand isn't high because ridiculous amounts of threads aren't particularly useful in most situations.      Most of the work I do is memory bandwidth constrained.   Memory bandwidth depends on your motherboard and your CPU.  i7 920   RAM Bandwidth - 25.6 GB/s RAM Types - DDR3 800Mhz/1066Mhz RAM Channels - 3 RAM Max - 24 GB   i7 6700k   RAM Bandwidth - 34.1 GB/s RAM Types - DDR3L 1333Mz/1600Mhz & DDR4 1866Mhz/2133Mhz3 RAM Channels - 24 RAM Max 64 GB     Footnotes   You are mostly looking at Physics score Not necessarily reliable  Does not support your current RAM This is a downgrade     By the way, CPUBoss is about the worst site for comparisons there is; same goes for GPUBoss. They simply give biased opinions on processors, i.e. any new Intel processors are considered superior to old ones, and almost every Intel processor is onsidered superior to AMD.
Not so easy to find Gaming headset with 600ohm. I know the Sennheiser HMD 26-II-600-X3K1 but it's out of your range.  600ohm is better but it doesn't mean that you cannot use lower impedence headset (http://www.cnet.com/news/headphone-buyers-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-low-vs-high-impedance-models/)  Considering this, going for the HyperX Cloud Revolver might be a good solution because:   In your price range (130â‚¬) Good reviews (espcially on sound and mic) Steel and well made LEDs Controller Black and red
I'll recommend a card based on the newly released Polaris architecture. The RX 470 seem to fit your needs nicely, considering you don't plan on gaming.  The reference version has 3 DP and 1 HDMI output. Unfortunately, since it is a gaming card,  it is unlikely to be passively cooled, however, most 3rd party cooler designs will be semipassive, which switches off the fans at low load, which is almost as good. They are still very quiet, potentially much quieter than your case fans.   Since the TDP is only 100 W, you could also get a high end passive cooler, such as the Accelero S3 for an extra USD 55, provided you're willing to install it yourself.
I would personally recommend Ubiquiti's UniFi line of infrastructure, which is rather inexpensive and is actually pretty good from what I've seen of it. The UniFi AP (Store page) should be suited for what you want. They would need to be configured by a device running their controller software though (which could be a raspberry pi or other cheap computer.) A tutorial for setting up the pfSense control webserver on the pi can be found here if you wish to use a pi for that task.
The issue is that two displays in 4K is only supported (from what I know and at the moment) by gaming cards... So in this case, you can forget cheap, passive etc. X)  However, did you consider using 2 GPU? The Radeon R7 250 passive (~70â‚¬) can display in 4K. In this case, 2 GPU isn't that expensive and will support 2 displays.
The new Blackberry Priv runs Android and has a physical keyboard, 4K display, Snapdragon 808 and 3GB of ram (so it should not be slow).  Its the closest thing from what you are looking for I guess.
Well, I cannot comment thus I write here: becarful, in the MSI Apache Pro link given by JetStream, the first (and less expensive version) is using a i5. According to what you want to do (media work with Adobe suite etc. wich, in addition to a good GPU, will take advantage of the 2 additionals cores provided by the i7 over the i5), I'd rather go for the i76700HQ/GTX970 version ;) its still in your price range ! (indeed, it has 1TB HDD instead of 256GB SSD, but you can still change that later)  To answer to your question about MSI: yes, it is a really good brand. There products (espcially laptops) are not that beautiful but the best adjective I'd use for them is "robust" :)
Well I'll post what I said in the comment as an answer too.  I suggest you to buy the MSI Apache Pro with the i7 6700HQ and GTX 970M because this is what you wanted. As for rendering the i7 is way better than the i5 because of more cores and therefore better Multithreading.   The HDD that is built in is with 1TB big enough and you wont find many Laptops that offer more.  As for gaming MSI should be very good. They jsut produce gear for gaming and their products are very well made. Most MSI products can also be upgraded easily. In an older MSI gaming Laptop I bought on ebay you could add an extra fan and extra HDD.  So I would suggest you to buy this ;)
If you have some DDR3 RAM and a PSU and case laying around, you might consider upgrading from ARM to x86, which would be a real boost not only to your single-threaded performance, but also to your graphics and RAM capacity. Of course as a whole package it will end up being bulkier and slightly more expensive.  If x86 isn't an option, you should be aware that MANY of the SBCs out there suffer from lackluster desktop experiences due to very poor linux support for their particular graphics drivers. Raspberry Pi uses one of the best-supported GPUs, so it's likely to give you the best possible desktop experience (especially the 3), just so long as you can figure out how to stay within the bounds of that 1gb RAM. For my money's worth, the best implementation of a Raspberry Pi OS I've ever seen has to be DietPi. Especially when you run it without X or a DE (i.e. in console, using only the framebuffer), it sips RAM. Now Adam, you might complain, I just said I need a desktop! Luckily you can still have a lot of what you like about desktops in your framebuffer using the gpm mouse driver for programs like mc and links2 which support a graphical mode in framebuffer-only environments.   A final alternative would be to get an android stick and try to make do with the Android environment, which has much better driver support for the GPUs on these ARM SBCs. You could even try running linux on it if you were feeling determined and adventurous.
The Sapphire R7 250 Ultimate meets most of the requirements:    Dual 4k/60fps capable Passively cooled One DP (can be split into two or more DP displays with an MST hub such as this. AMD chipset
IMHO AMD is a better bet for your CPU configuration when it comes to video editing, and won't hurt you when you play low and midrange games. This build features better RAM, storage, and GPU power than that listed above, for only ~50 more, and I think it would very much be worth it.

It is optimized to deliver the most bang for buck, and has much less room to upgrade than the build you found initially. I still think it's a good choice, because it will provide better performance out of the box for longer, with lower expense over the first two to three years of the build (accounting for upgrades).
I know that this isn't a hardware answer but TeamPlayer4 (from Dicolab https://www.dicolab.com/) might do what you are looking for. With that, you can use several input devices for several users. So even if typing on keyboard A doesn't disable keyboard B, as far as it is not the same user, keyboard B won't mix up with A ;)

I am going to assume you need x86 compatible cores/threads, and I am going to assume you don't want to use something like the Xeon Phi compute card, for some reason or another. I am also going to assume, because you didn't specify, that power requirements and heat dispersion considerations are not something you're worried about, since it wasn't mentioned.  That being said, there are some absolute monsters out there you can fit into pretty small builds.   On the AMD side, you're stuck back in 2012 unless you get fancy with ARM, but you can still get very powerful 64 real-core systems built on quad-socket G34 server boards that are somehow crammed into 1U chassis by Supermicro and other companies.  On the Intel side, where I suspect you'll end up, you can get the formidable    Intel Xeon E5-2699 V4, with 22 cores and 44 threads PER PROCESSOR, onto large multi-CPU boards, or onto thin ITX boards like this one: http://www.anandtech.com/show/9221/asrock-rack-announces-epc612d4i, or this one http://www.asrockrack.com/general/productdetail.asp?Model=EP2C612D8HM#Specifications - whichever way nets you the most density. I'm not recommending AsRock as a brand per se either, I'm just showing you what's possible using their site.  If none of that will suffice, you're really gonna have to look into stuff like Xeon Phi, IBM Power8, or ARM architectures. Although more exotic and therefore more difficult to work with, these types of CPU feature very high compute densities, with different approaches each. More information/research would be necessary before anything in this area could be recommended.
They're not all that different.   A rough estimate of relative CPU computational power: http://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp%5B%5D=2542&cmp%5B%5D=2470  (note the 35W AMD TDP vs the 15W Intel TDP; this is what Mr. Zhu was referring to when he estimated the Intel would have better battery life given identical batteries, HDDs, etc.)  The AMD chip will enjoy somewhat better GPU performance: http://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-Radeon-R6-Carrizo-Benchmarks.144290.0.html  Especially if you upgrade the system RAM from 1600mhz to something more like 2133mhz sodimms (example product: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231751&nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-PCPartPicker,%20LLC--na--na-_-na&cm_sp=&AID=10446076&PID=3938566&SID=)  I would say that if mobility is a big concern, then ask for an Intel model. Also ask for Intel if you absolutely, positively MUST have the best single-thread performance.  Otherwise, if you're usually going to be plugged in wherever you work, and you are looking for a more well-rounded processor in your laptop, get the A10-8700P and upgrade its RAM.
I did some digging around and in the end I got a Lexmark CX 310.  The only thing it falls down on is the duplex scanning automatically, however the interface allows for it.  Having used it for a while now its a good little printer and fits nicely to my needs.
In my answer I'll expand a little bit on Adam's answer. I'll also restrict myself to Intel processors and all brand recommendations should be taken with a grain of salt given the fact that I don't have any actual / hands-on experience with this sort of hardware.  So your aim is maximal density of cores / space. What this means is that you want to fit as many processors into as small spaces as possible.  If you don't really care about the distribution of CPUs across mainboards, then 1U servers with full-scale 2-socket Xeon E5 v4s is the way to go. Or if you're willing to spend some time searching and asking hardware providers, then you can also get probably a 4-socket Xeon E7 v4s 1U setup (or if you ask really nice an 8-socket mainboard may also fit, note that 4XXX CPUs are for 4-socket configurations and 8XXX CPUs are for 8-socket configurations). This should have the most cores per space unit if you don't care about grouping.  If you want to have as many cores on a single board as possible, then going with 8-socket Xeon E7 v4s is the way to go. Although chances are that it's going to be less optimal in the cores / space department.  Additionally you should consider using Xeon Phi and / or Nvidia Tesla accelerator cards. The Nvidia cards go well with highly parallelizable (small) workloads while the Phis are basically dumbed down Intel processors grouped up onto a PCIe card and thus support linear workload much better.  One last note: Depending on what you plan to do, a proper RISC architecture like PowerPC, ARM and SPARC may be worth a look, given that a lot of the current Top500 supercomputers use these architectures.  Example providers of Xeon E7 equipment include Delta Computers (only in German?), Lenovo and Supermicro. As for the CPUs, the Intel Xeon E5 2699v4 is the dual-socket CPU with the most cores. The Intel Xeon E5 4669 v4 for 4-socket (only 16 cores each) and the Intel Xeon E7 8890 v4 for 8-sockets (24 physical cores each). The Nvidia Tesla P100 is the best current super computing card by Nvidia and the Intel Xeon Phi 7290F is the best current Xeon Phi card.
There are probably CHEAPER ways to do this, but here's A solution:   Intel RS3DC050 PCI-Express 3.0 x4 Low Profile Ready SATA / SAS Controller Card http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816117427 Intel Upgrade RAID SSD Cache-with Fastpath for RS25 http://www.provantage.com/intel-rs3sc008~7ITE90QU.htm Intel AXXRMFBU4 RAID Maintenance Free Backup Unit with Super Capacitor Brown Box White Box https://www.amazon.com/Intel-AXXRMFBU4-Maintenance-Backup-Capacitor/dp/B01DIT7ZO8   Notes: http://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/support/server-products/raid-products/000008342.html  Basically you get this RAID card installed, you attach the key to it, you fire it up, you configure SSD Cache and possibly also Fastpath as needed, you make your SSDs into a cache array and get it assigned to your RAID10 array, and off you go.  You've now dropped a something near a grand into something that could be performed at a fraction of the cost if you'd just let it hit the CPU a teensy bit, but there you go, SSD caching on hardware RAID with a ridiculous number of SSDs and HDDs simultaneously in play.   Finally, just for the record - "This is for a gaming workstation, not a dedicated server."  You emphatically do not need this and will not notice performance differences between this and a standard software-cached SSD+HDD RAID solution using something like PrimoCache. It is one of the most overkill solutions I have ever come up with at the behest of someone else, and I did it only to see if it could be done. You personally have no viable use case for this hardware.  EDIT: I forgot to add in the cost of the SAS to SATA cables themselves; that's another couple dozen bucks at a minimum.
If your it department is open to getting custom built laptops then I would recommend you get a laptop from digital storm. They custom build computers. I have a digital storm laptop and it can handle pretty much any programming work load better than most workstations. As for specs I do not think you need 32gb of RAM. I think 16gb should do. I do not know how big your sql server database is but you should be able to get away with 16gb of ram. I think for the CPU you should get a nice solid Intel i7 6700k. I know that is a desktop processor but they do offer them in laptops. You probably don't need a big GPU unless you use GPU computing but I doubt you do so i would recommend you just use the Intel CPUs onboard graphics. For storage I would recommend you get an ssd for your boot drive and a fast mechanical data drive. If your sql database is big then I would recommend that you get big 512gb ssd for your data drive so that you can have your sql database on your data drive. If you cannot get a custom built laptop then I would recommend you get a ASUS gaming laptop as those laptops are usually pretty high speced or you could even get an Alienware if you could fork over that kind of money.
The answer is quite straightforward: P4 has only one core, 512kb L2 cache vs 2 cores and 3MB cache. These two caracteristics have to be considered as much as clock speed.  Besides, P4 is manufactured with 120nm vs 22nm => P4 uses 68.4W while i3 uses 15W.  The P4 is quite old now so you also have to consider that its old socket isn't available on newly main-boards (no ddr3, no usb3 etc.)
You should tell us the laptop you have. Most of laptops actually do not have video input (I know that some lenovo and alienware does).  Besides, you have to solutions:   The software one, that emulate a video input (such as Maxivista) The hardware one, which need an (expensive) device such a VGA2USB (https://www.epiphan.com/products/vga2usb/). (Note that such devices cost most of the time 200 to 300 â‚¬ which leads me to say that it might be wiser to buy a monitor X) )   Since I never did that I can't tell for sure, but I think both solutions leeds to a latency that might be unsuitable for gaming.
Does the D-LINK DCH-S150 (http://us.dlink.com/products/connected-home/wi-fi-motion-sensor/) suits you?  It's connected to your local wifi and registered onto your D-LINK account which leads to a control from the D-LINK app on your smartphone.
Not wanting to pay an ongoing monthly fee for either monitoring or cell service of alerts really limits the options here.  You can cobble together D-Link WiFi Motion Sensors (currently DCH-S150, about $40/apiece) and control them using IFTTT.com.  iSmartAlarm appears to be a step up, with a wireless hub that integrates a siren and the ability to link and control many devices: extra $30 motion sensors, $25 door/window sensors, cameras, and electrical switches.  Other "self-monitored" systems are built around cameras:  E.g., Canary security devices are under $200 and each one includes full HD video as well as motion detection, humidity and temperature measurement, and a siren.  Piper is similar, and Novi has a smoke detector built in to each ceiling-mount unit.
There can't be anything exactly like you're looking for due to the way USB flash storage works. It's just a USB controller chip attached to flash media; you would need an additional encryption chip on the PCB of the device that took everything the controller fed it and encrypted it. It would have to be powered over the USB link and it would also have to provide a way for people to decrypt its contents via some kind of interface no matter what it was plugged into. I suppose in theory it might be done, but the vast majority of use cases would be better served with encryption being performed on the system itself, where it can be faster, innately compatible, and tailored.   It should not be hard to set up software that watches for a USB drive attached to the system to have files added to it, then automatically encrypts that volume. It might be possible to defeat that system by pulling the drive prior to encryption automatically beginning, but that would require some pretty remarkable deftness.   The audit trail idea seems MUCH more viable. A quick review of links on Google leads me to this: https://www.manageengine.com/products/active-directory-audit/removable-storage-auditing.html?ADAPID=1522&kw=%2Busb%20%2Bfile%20%2Blog&adId=27633832007&gclid=CjwKEAjwqpK8BRD7ua-U0orrgkESJADlN3YBY-7r2DY5KPPjSLdJ0zfn52h1m_bm39e2pWdO_WUSDxoCaAvw_wcB  Which appears to be a server-based solution. Obviously file transfers would need to be illegal if the computer were not currently networked or something like that to maintain security.  This is a free, local software doing much the same thing, but of course as such it would be fairly easy to defeat if a knowledgeable adversary were attempting to steal data.  EDIT: looking over your post again, I think the Startech USB HDD with inline AES encryption is extremely close to what you're asking for (and it overcomes all the problems I said devices like this would need to overcome in order to work). I would go with that device. "Access to the encrypted data is allowed through a built-in touchpad" strongly implies write capability is denied until the key is entered.
The old one is going to be just fine; it has not degraded and PSU technology has not changed significantly in the past 3 years.   Aside from my own personal experience with pulling out heavily used and abused OEM PSUs from computers discarded into trash heaps for fun (yes, I'm that guy), there don't seem to be that many good studies of the reasons PSUs decay. There are many anecdotal discussions which mirror my own experiences to greater/lesser degrees: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/31j95k/brothers_how_long_does_a_psu_typically_last/, but generally what this comes down to is so-called "common sense."  The PSU is fundamentally a very robust bit of solid state technology save everything except the fan(s). The fan is, because it is a mechanical part, the single most likely point of failure. Capacitors and such age over time, reducing their efficiency and tolerance, but this is a slow process with good units and even (usually) with bad old OEM units. The only other thing I know of which is KNOWN to degrade PSU technology is heat, which it would not experience sitting in storage unless it was stored in a very hot place like an attic in Arizona or something. NASA has some documentation on how they test for MTBF in solid-state electrical systems, and you can see from their methodology that heat and electrical current are the real threats to aged components.   As for the technology advancing, the best way to prove this to you is simply to refer you to sites like Newegg, Amazon, Directron, or similar, because you will see all the perks of your PSU are still being advertised as perks on modern PSUs. There is really no fundamental difference.
I actually just bought this:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B4W40VC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  This has Rx/Tx so its a receiver and transmitter.  What sets this one apart from all the rest is: you can use it while its charging.  There are cheaper ones that you cant use while its charging so you have to wait.  Also has excellent reviews.  Has micro USB as charging port. Has LED to indicate on/off Other light colors/modes to indicate charging/paired/pairing/etc (about 8 hours continuous use) Latest Bluetooth 4.1 so range should be 33ft with no barriers (your milage may wary).  Specifications:  - Bluetooth Compliance: Bluetooth V4.1, CSR 8670 chipet, A2DP - Transmit Range: up to 33ft / 10m  - Supports: Dual Stream (TX mode); Multi-Point (RX mode) - Codec: APT-X LL(TX), APT-X(TX), SBC(TX), SBC(RX) - Working Time: about 8 hours - Charging Time: 2 hours / 5V; can be used while being recharged - Dimension: L 4.6 x W 3.3 x H 0.97 cm / 1.81 x 1.30 x 0.38 in  - Net Weight: 0.51 oz / 14.5 g   IMPORTANT: - Please plug in the power adapter before turning on TROND BT-DUO when using external power source; - TROND BT-DUO will only use aptX Low Latency when your BT headset, speaker or receiver does support aptX LL. Otherwise, TROND BT-DUO will pair down to aptX or SBC; - The latency of 40ms is still unacceptable for live sound monitoring. Therefore, musicians beware! TROND BT-DUO may not suit your needs.
OK, finally have a solution  What you do is install this to get 5 ports, then add a cable to out panel adapter  to get a full 9 off a single controller.  Speeds may be limited by the controller or the PCI-E 2.0 1x bus, but then again, USB drives usually perform far below theoretical maximums, so you might experience no bottlenecks at all.  Then again, it might also be really expensive in Norway...

Putting a splitter into each of the native PCI-E slots, you get 24 GPU connections at, I think, 1x PCI-E 2.0 each, for a total transfer rate (theoretical up+down) of 1000MB/s. However, there are only 40 lanes on each CPU, so unless the PCH on the motherboard takes care of that part of the issue (I'm not certain how PCH works), each GPU will get something more like 833 MB/s theoretical maximum bandwidth.      Blockquote   (4000mbs 4x PCI-E 2.0 bandwidth / 4 gpus) * 0.8325 percent lane saturation    Blockquote   There are probably other ways of doing this that would net you more CPUs and thus more lanes, and I do know they make GPU backplanes that might be of use here, but this was the configuration I was comfortable recommending and I do like that it fits nicely within the desire to keep things working on a standard format workstation motherboard.  The fans, coolers, RAM, storage, PSU are all just suggestions, not strict requirements - they are a common kind of configuration for builds like this that I have seen recommended before Note that this system, as configured, would be extremely loud and might have to run headless to make the most use of your GPU/PCI-E resources.
nVidia has a desktop sized DevBox. Fair warning...it isn't cheap. You can order a fully configured, nVidia supported one for approximately $15,000.

As long as you are happy with 80+ Platinum and the power envelope, there have been no significant improvements in power supply technology over the past few years. A quality PSU is a quality PSU. If it's been sat in a box, it won't have degraded, as it would have under use (PSU calculators use a 10% per year worst case in their analysis, generally you get better than that though).  The bottom line with a PSU is how much power it can provide, and how efficiently it provides it. The AX line was top of Corsairs range, just as the AXi line is now. The AXi switches analogue for digital regulation, but all that really adds is the ability to monitor/adjust PSU parameters from software, it doesn't inherently make the PSU more powerful or more efficient.  I would suggest that you only upgrade if:   You need a higher power envelope for your new rig (unlikely if you are going for a recent 14nm CPU / 16nm GPU combination, especially if your original system was spec'd for dual 28nm era GPUs). You want the higher power efficiently of 80+ Titanium (unlikely to be economic unless electricity prices are very high where you live). You want to tinker with or monitor PSU parameters live as your system is running (doesn't seem like it is worth the expense).
Another option you may want to look at are Industrial single board computers based on the PICMG 1.3 spec.  For example the ROBO-8122VG2R SBC supports a pair of E5-2600 series CPUs:    There is also the Advantech PCE-9228, which actually specifies that it supports v3 CPUs.  Combine these with a quad split chassis backplane and you could potentially have 8 Xeons and 4 Xeon Phi's in a single 4U 19" rack chassis.    I'm not sure this would be any more compact than a cluster of 1U rack servers, but I suspect that they might be easier to work on.
In terms of getting standardized performance out of your IDE drive, the best advice I can give you is to add an IDE controller card to your PC so that you can get a direct IDE to bus connection going over the PCI or PCI-E interface. I've had bad luck getting SATA > IDE adapters to work and would not recommend them.  The big problem here is that an IDE controller card costs about as much as, if not more than, a new SATA DVD-RW drive, which would also yield increased performance. It might make more sense simply to bite the bullet and upgrade the drive.
I agree with most of what Alpha3031 told you, but I think there are better options for your use case than the 860K. To explain, I'm going to go a little into the nuances of CPU lid design and hyperthreading.  I recommend you look for a slightly more expensive 870K or 880K (also on the FM2+ socket) - and failing that, you should strongly consider a Haswell or Skylake i3 (sockets 1150 or 1151) clocked at or above 3.5ghz.  The reason one such as yourself would care about the differences between the 860K and the 870K/880K are small, but worth the price difference in your case. First of all, whereas the 860K has paste TIM between its die and the CPU lid, the 870K and 880K, both Godavari refreshes of the Kaveri Steamroller design of the 860K, sport the superior metal flux between their dies and lids - this transfers heat between the die and lid much better than paste. This matters to you because you will want to make your CPU last longer than it probably otherwise would at stock speeds, so you will be overclocking, the success of which partly depends on how well you can dissipate waste heat from the CPU. With a good air or water cooler and the proper amount of overvolting, I would expect the average 870K/880K to reach somewhere around 4.6-4.8ghz, whereas it seems the 860K reaches lower top speeds on average; say 4.3-4.5ghz. Normally I'd say quibbling over a few hundred megahertz is not worth it, but you'll want everything you can get, I think. A potential alternative would be the weird Athlon X4 845 (FM2+), because it sports a superior IPC to the bigger chips as it is designed from the newer Carrizo Excavator architecture, but it is not unlocked and the newer arch only gives you 10-15% better performance at best. If for some reason you were unable to overclock and needed to stay with AMD (say to keep prices down), I'd recommend that CPU.  The other option is, somewhat surprisingly, to spring for a low-end Intel i3 CPU. Many people disparage i3 CPUs due to their dual core architectures, but since i3s use hyperthreading, they actually operate 4 threads, which makes them quad cores as far as games are concerned - software only sees threads, not physical cores. The great advantage to choosing these more expensive Intel parts is twofold - you will get to put it on a motherboard socket with significantly more upgrade potential than FM2+ (FM2+ doesn't really have any CPUs with superior performance to the 880K while the 1150 and 1151 sockets support the vastly more powerful i7 and Xeon series), and as Alpha3031 indicated, Intel CPUs have much higher IPC, meaning they perform much faster on each core than AMD's offerings. While their overall performance tends to bring them neck and neck with AMD's Steamroller quad cores, they can't be beat for single thread performance at this price point, and you will see markedly better performance from an i3 over even an overclocked Athlon in games which utilize only 1 or 2 threads.
OK, I think I have a solution that will be very close to what you originally had in mind: a USB hub with individual port power switches.  By turning power on and off to two keyboards attached to this hub, you can have two keyboards attached to a single computer that don't get in the way of each other - they can be locked out from entering commands until power is restored to their port.
Explanation  Performance  Clock speed ('Ghz') is not all that matters when it comes to performance.  Quite a few things can dictate how well a certain CPU performs, including but not limited to   IPC (instructions per cycle) Arcithecture ('nm') Clock speed ('Ghz') Cache ('MB' & 'KB') Cores (1,2,4,6,8,etc.) (multi thread performance) TDP ('W','Watts') (Power consumption)   Features  Furthermore, a CPU's desirability can furthermore be increased/decreased by how many features it has and what chipset it uses.   Hyperthreading (Virtual cores) RAM capacity  RAM channels (Complicated stuff, not too much to worry about) Chipset (Does it support modern motherboards?) Integrated graphics (does not require a separate graphics card)   Comparison  Specifications   i3-4005U Pentium 4 2.8Ghz i3 uses 22nm architecture, P4 uses 120nm i3 has a 15W TDP, P4 has a 65W TDP i3 has integrated graphics i3 has hyperthreading i3 has 2 cores, P4 has 1 core i3 has a newer chipset i3 has a built in memory controller i3 has more cache i3 has a variety of features the P4 doesn't   Benchmarks  (i3 on the left, P4 on the right) (Higher is better!)   Passmark | 2435 | 325 | i3-4005U is 650% better.   Unfortunately there are no other benchmarks that I can find that contain information on both the i3-4005U and the Pentium 4 since the Pentium 4 is 11 years older than the i3.  TL;DR  Get the i3-4005U because it is far less outdated, requires no dedicated graphics card, uses a less outdated chipset, and performs much better in terms of single core performance and (because it has a second core) dual core performance.
The Logitech G402 Hyperion Fury meets most of the requirements. It is a little more than your ideal price.

You don't have to buy the additional parts of the Raspberry Pi in order for it to boot up and run your server. All you need is the power charger, the Pi itself, and an SD card large enough to run your system. I recommend the Pi, because it is much better supported than competing SBCs, there are models with wifi and bluetooth built in (Raspberry Pi 3), and ultimately it will provide you with more performance for less money than other solutions, both because of its integrated components and because good support means better production results overall, plus added benefits like well-understood overclocking, etc.
There's nothing that meets both your price requirement and your performance requirement.  Price-wise, the traditional budget GPU is the 750 Ti at around $90-$100, but it's slightly less powerful than your current card; $120 gets you a factory-overclocked 750 Ti that just about matches your card for performance.  Performance-wise, three times your current performance is the GTX 980, at a price of around $400.  At twice your current performance, there's still nothing within your budget: the options are the GTX 970 (twice the specs) for $275, or the GTX 770 (twice the raw number-crunching ability, but only moderate gains in pixel-pushing) for $200.  The Tom's Hardware GPU Hierarchy illustrates the problem you're running into: you're looking for something three to four tiers above your current card, and you're already near the top of the chart.
I'll take a crack at this - please keep in mind I pushed for very high spec within the cost restriction, so if you're more interested in bang for your buck over the short term this might not be the best build. It certainly is designed to give you good performance now and good longevity on all the important bits.

It also uses a lot more power and will generate a lot more heat, although by many standards it is a highly efficient design. The GPU included is fit only to provide a monitor hookup; don't plan on doing any GPU-heavy compute with it. However, the PSU is strong enough to support a midrange GPU addition if needed. Many game servers run headless, so perhaps that is not a big deal.  I am going to quickly run down my part choices in very short summary format; feel free to ask for more information about any of this:  CPU - modern with a good combination of single core performance, efficiency, and multithreaded capability, which is important for compiling and running multiple applications simultaneously.  Motherboard - this motherboard was small and fits in most of the features  a modern server might benefit from - fast PCI-E SSD storage, PCI-E 16x connections, 2x gigabit ethernet, and the like.   RAM - 16gb dual channel is a sort of de regeur standard for modern multitasking workstations and low-end servers; you can replace with larger sticks if needed.  CPU Cooler - a robust, cheap solution.   SSD - small SSD for caching or a unix-based boot drive.  HDDs - a RAID1 configuration as requested, cheap and a good brand.  GPU - fanless, low power, modern.  Case: unobtrusive, small, good for keeping things clean inside without holes all over it.  PSU - this is a highly efficient, high quality PSU with no moving parts; this should provide extra longevity and excellent power savings, particularly at idle. Its ability to run without a fan is the primary reason I chose this.
Pick up a refurb Dell Precision M4700 and add a 1Tb drive via DVD adapter. This satisfies all of your bizarre non-laptop-esque requirements.  Or you could, you know, get all of this in the much more sensible desktop form factor, have it be twice as powerful, cost less, and be more upgradeable. But hey, that's just me thinking crazy.
I personally have yet to find a better component for this job than the Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I PCI-Express x1 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Adapter.   Native linux support at least in debian/ubuntu AC/N/G support PCI-E 2.0 1x (probably the single best balance between performance and compatibility of any interface type) Good performance reviews Half-height compatible Fully modular - antennae and chip can be refitted Extra bells and whistles like bluethooth
If you have not already purchased anything, it is entirely possible for an APU to provide you with the processing AND graphics power you need to run the game well. Given that StarCraft II is not highly threaded, but that unfortunately Intel refuses to put any worthy GPU on anything below an i5, I recommend something like the A10-7890K, which at ~150 represents a $75 CPU combined with a $75 GPU and pretty much performs like it, too. Just be sure to pair it with 2133 or 2400mhz RAM.  Alternatively, get whatever CPU you want and pair it with a GPU like the R7 250X or GTX 750; either one is powerful enough for SCII in spades.
A quick search on Dell's website surfaced with this:  New Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1   Price: â‚¬689 CPU: i5-6200U RAM: 8GB Screen: 13.3 inch 1080p IPS touchscreen WiFi: Dual Band AC Bluetooth: Bluetooth 4.0 Ports: Micro SD card reader, 3 USB (2 of which are 3.0), audio jack   It has a 256GB SSD and it's called "two in one" because it has a 360Â° hinge on the screen.
A few years ago I took the cheapest machine I could find (300 Euros with no OS), put Ubuntu on it and am quite content. Use it as a development web server and when IÂ´m abroad.  15" Asus K53U: 2 GB RAM, AMD C-50 dual core CPU at 1 GHz, DVD writer, VGA and HDMI, camera, 3xUSB, card reader, Ethernet, WLAN and a Kensingtom Lock. Swapped the hard drive with an SSD some day.  DoesnÂ´t really fly, but itÂ´s sufficient for Open Office, DVDs and video streaming, a good deal of browser windows (IÂ´m avoiding Firefox though) and a LLMP.    There are better machines nowadays for the same price. I would probably get a Lenovo B50 today, if I needed a new machine ... or do the same I did three years ago:    Look around my current location for the cheapeast machine I can find, and see if it meets the needs.
I suggest the Super Flower Golden Silent PSU, available on Amazon.it. It is quite literally silent because it has no fan. Important specifications follow:   0dbm 80+ Gold efficiency rating 430W capacity Part number: SF-430P14FG Has the 4+4 and 20+4 power connectors needed for this motherboard.
Check out this: GeChic 2501H 15.6" 1920x1080 Portable Monitor with HDMI, VGA Inputs. This is a battery-powered, tablet-like form-factor screen from a well-known company. It meets all requirements listed above except for the size requirement - it is about two and a half inches too wide. This product has been on the market for some time; I realize now that I had been researching a similar need a year or two ago, so the reviews available to us on store pages for the device are long-standing and reflect somewhat on its build quality and usefulness.
Would highly recommend and AMD RX 480 - 4GB model. That is less than 200 Euros i believe. If you save a big more you could get the 8GB model, given if you are just watching HD movies and rendering videos than the 4GB model should be perfect for you use cases!  Plus, Sony Vegas does get Accelerated Graphics support from AMD Graphics Cards, so you will be able to render video faster!
The fastest solution is a desktop with integrated+dedicated graphics that both support 2+ 1080p monitors, like this. That's around $440.  The other solution is to build your own, of course!

I'd recommend the GeForce GT 710, a fairly new card aimed at HTPCs as a replacement to integrated graphics. It supports up to 4096x2160 resolution, has a very low profile, and is plenty fast for any video viewing or streaming.  The particular model I linked not passive, but should be more than silent enough, especially over the sound anything you're watching. However, there is a dual slot passive version as well if your case can support it.  I am very lacking in my understanding of hardware decoding, however, so you might want to verify its capable of x265 decoding, but this page seems to indicate it can.
Id Recommend an AMD RX 480 4GB GPU. It is around $200 and it supports 4k movies It is a small, i dont know the height unfortunately.
OK, third attempt is the charm, right? This gets you what you want in what has to be, bar none, the smallest possible package. But it will require some know-how on your end as far as software goes.

The External HDD connects to the router's 3.0 port The fan connects to the router's 2.0 port and is set to cool the router - you may want to drill holes in the router's shell to facilitate this. The UPS powers the whole setup.   Here's the trick - how to get node.js running on a router? I think I have the answer:   Install OpenWRT or dd-WRT on the router, whichever works for you. This model supports both options. On a desktop computer - preferably a very powerful linux workstation - you crosscompile node.js for ARMv7 (the chip powering this router is specifically noted here). Copy the resulting script file over to your router's flash storage area - you have ~100mb NAND flash to work with. Install tmux or screen.  Run the script inside a detached tmux or screen session on the router. Configure router as needed to make server visible to connecting parties. Don't go over ~400mb RAM usage, your router only has 512mb.
According to this site: http://www.techspot.com/review/1180-overwatch-benchmarks/page2.html, the best deal (good performances / low price) for your planned use would be the GTX660ti (https://www.amazon.fr/Asus-GTX660TI-DC2O-2GD5-graphique-Geforce-PCI-Express/dp/B009KZ4DK4).  This GPU runs Overwatch, ultra settings, 1080p (I assume that its your resolution) at ~80fps and is around 100â‚¬.  However, becarful, you didn't say your current configuration (especially CPU): for a twitch/live record of your screen, I'd say that CPU is as much important as GPU. Besides, the 80fps performance had been get using a i7 6700k wich is quite de best CPU you can get for gaming, for now.  So you should tell us more about your config in an edit and I'll be able to edit this answer accordingly.
I'm sorry I don't have a source on this as it's more of a result of long experience in the industry than anything else I can really point to, documentation-wise (so if someone else comes along with a document-supported answer, obviously upvote that answer, not this one), but I am 100% confident that both drives are running at 7200rpm. The difference in model number probably only denotes a difference in OEM part supplier change, likely in the controller chip or PCB, as these are things which are swapped out all the time and not necessarily made in-house at Seagate. For what it's worth, here are the data sheets for ST2000DM001 and ST2000DM006. Controller identification is not provided, but performance data is. They are both 7200rpm drives, they are both listed as providing the same reads, writes, warranty, etc. Given that all else appears the same, I advise you to choose the cheaper of the two drives. If they are the same price, choose the newer ST2000DM006 since support for it might be longer.
Given that compiling is a thread-heavy job, your user is best off with the i7 that most cheaply gets them the most threads. Given that all i7 CPUs on the 1150 socket feature 8 threads, that means simply getting them the cheapest i7 you can put in that socket, which would likely be the Intel Core i7-4770S or Intel Core i7-4790.  As an aside, Xeon processors are extremely similar to i7 CPUs and fit on this socket. In addition, they support ECC RAM, which is a feature many compiling rigs benefit from due to the high memory usage and long compile times they can undergo. In addition, some Xeons, like the Intel Xeon E3-1275 V3, currently offer higher performance and lower cost than some of those i7s previously mentioned, and would thus be a better fit. Keep in mind to utilize the ECC feature of Xeon processors, the motherboard and RAM must also support ECC.  Amazon.co.uk had the lowest prices I could find on these processors.
This questions has already been answered but here is concrete information provided from seagate.  I also agree with the answer.  Screen Shot 2016-07-22 at 1.58.13 PM.png
This is a pushbutton. There are many like it, but this one is yours.  And this is how you connect it to your serial port.  Usually these kinds of things require a little modification, unless such a part is sold by the very people who made the software you're using.   The USB solution may work just as well, I'm not sure.
Very good deal:http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121855&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC--pla--Video+Card+-+Nvidia-_-N82E16814121855&gclid=CIPejvXph84CFQgxaQodFewLEQ&gclsrc=aw.ds  This is 10$ more than your budget but I don't see why you cant chip 10$ in. This is a very solid card but your wishlist is very extravagant for this price range. This should meet your requirements except high settings and recording is just way out of your budget so you would probably have to play on medium. Or if you want high fps maybe low-medium.  Resources:http://gpuboss.com/gpus/GeForce-GTX-750-Ti-vs-GeForce-GTX-660-Ti  According to that It is equal and slightly better than the 660 ti so if the website the person referenced is true than you should get equal fps or better.
So if you are looking for what I think you are looking for I would suggest you look for a cheap server on ebay or in a small form factor case for around 80$ like this one:http://www.ebay.com/itm/FAST-DELL-DUAL-CORE-3-4-GHZ-DESKTOP-COMPUTER-PC-4GB-RAM-Wifi-WINDOWS-7-PRO-/262152856157?hash=item3d0987225d:g:AdoAAOSwYmZXI2bs  This is very small comes with windows 7 and you can configure it with a 2tb hard drive for 100$ then for an os you can use windows 7 or you can use free nas which is an amazing server software which I have used myself and if you want to bring the 80$ down you can look for one with no os and just buy the hard drive and slip it in and put free nas on it. Now I dont know if you need a nice router but if you do I suggest this: http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/555607/Belkin-N300-Wireless-Router/?cm_mmc=PLA--Google--Printers_Scanners_Faxes-_-555607-VQ6-47886868676-VQ16-c-VQ17-pla-VQ18-online-VQ19-555607-VQ20-76926630596-VQ21--VQ22-177839036-VQ27-9203161796&gclid=CILM5pvuh84CFQ6EaQodFvsHxw  I have this hooked up to my modem and can get around 100mbps download speed  Speaking of modems if you want a nice one of those I would suggest this: ARRIS / Motorola SurfBoard SB6183 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem â€“ 600 MHz Dual-Thread Processor  If you have decent internet speed any one of these things are nice options for what you want if I am reading it right Sorry If I did not understand what you wanted  btw for freenas there are TONS of easy tutorials to set it up  But I have no idea if I wrote what you wanted sorry if I did not

If you are running 1080p there are card choices for you to play overwatch near max settings with a GPU around $100.  I recommend you continue saving to at least get an AMD RX 480 for about $200 dollars and that will play EPIC settings which is maxed settings.  But lets say you couldn't spend any more than $150, then I would recommend GTX 950. Here is one on amazon for less than $150 - MSI GTX 950 $132.99.  But lets say you couldn't spend any more than $125, then I would recommend a, like the others an GTX 660ti.  But overall, it seems like the GTX 950 is my overall recommended card in your case.  Edited: after seeing your using a intel i5, you should be fine to hit higher frames these cards are intended to hit. If you can't hit the desired frames, then you might want to look into safety overclocking your CPU and GPU.  Newest Edit The NVIDIA GTX 1060 just came out for MSRP $250, that and the AMD RX 480, destroys current 1080p games! IMPORTANT: in order to get any of these new cards listed for their MSRP, you will have to wait for less demand and more supply. Cause right now people are buying these cards for more than what they're supposed to cost. Or buy them from a BestBuy or something. Usually, BestBuy doesn't push their prices up based on supply and demand.  As for windows G, im not sure what that is, but i know people who use twitch that stream with twitch has that equal or more powerful cards listed in this post with no problems at all.
Just connect it to the PSU unless the noise it makes is not acceptable. It is not bad for the fan to run at full speed all the time. The splitters will communicate the same fan speed to both fans.
You have almost the same model as yours, but using a bluetooth connection: https://www.amazon.com/ThinkPad-Compact-Bluetooth-Keyboard-TrackPoint/dp/B00C32FWJC  No wires, no connection issues and a trackpoint which is all you asked for.   A bit expensive though...  EDIT After the comments about the non-reliability of the ThinkPad bluetooth keyboard, and since I cannot find any other wireless keyboard with a trackpad, an idea came to my mind: using a standard, wired ThinkPad key board (such as http://amzn.to/2a7ekRo, something that you already have) and link it to a wireless usb hub (http://amzn.to/2atdCRv). Definitely not the prettiest solution but it can free you out from short cable while in front of tv.
You can buy used. For example, This - HP DC7800 Ultra Small Form Factor Desktop Computer (Refurbished) - is an extremely cheap x86 platform that does actually have some upgrade potential. It costs $50, but is more powerful than some SBC options and certainly more configurable.  It is the cheapest such machine I am aware of from large suppliers online. You may be able to source considerably better machines locally.
I recommend the Pi-Top. It is mostly opensourced. The GPU driver has a proprietary blob in it, I think, but of course you don't need to install that; there are several terminal-only distros you could use on this device. I believe even most of the hardware, if not all of the hardware, is open source at this point, or will be in the near future.
I will make the case that the ASRock Z97 Extreme6 motherboard is the best choice because of its feature set and price.  The first thing to note about all boards under consideration is that they are absolutely top-notch. These boards represented the best each respective company could put together when socket 1150 was the leading socket for Intel. In terms of durability, reliability, and manufacturer support, these rank ahead of any other OEM motherboard for this socket in the desktop space. This leaves only price and feature set to differentiate them.   Another poster has recommended the Asus Maximus Ranger vii motherboard. This was a very popular choice in its heyday because it had a good marketing campaign, Asus enjoys good brand rep, and because it was priced intelligently above many of its competitors, giving it the aura of an elite product SKU (which it certainly is). However, I think that for precisely these reasons, it is now certainly not the right choice for you. This board is not in much supply right now, so unless you want to buy used, it will be difficult to procure at a reasonable cost. My recommendation, the ASRock Z97 Extreme6, is still available on Newegg at a very competitive price.   Though price seems to favor AsRock's board, this means nothing if AsRock doesn't bring compelling features to the table. Fortunately, AsRock does. Let's compare (please excuse the crappy pic):    In almost all of the most important ways, these two boards are identical. They enjoy the same chipset, the same RAM slots, the same cooling schema, and a similar audio chipset. The important advantages of the Extreme6 are as follows:   Dual gigabit ethernet. This allows quite a bit of flexibility and creativity when it comes to how you configure your network - you can even team these connections together to get a better connection to your router, though that's probably not going to help much if you don't also have a teamed connection all the way out to a fiber line - the real joy of having this feature is that the board will remain useful to you as a server after it has ceased being your gaming rig. It also allows you to do neat things like daisy chain an ethernet connection to another PC, or access some kind of network resource like a server, separate LAN, or whatever while not giving up your primary hardline connection to do so. 6x USB 3.0 without headers. This is great because it means two more USB 3.0 connections and more longevity in terms of your ability to support modern peripherals. Displayport output on motherboard. This is the most modern video out format available, and it is not available on the Maximus. mPCI-E port. This gives you access to cheap laptop parts like wifi cards, 4G modems, and GPS units. It represents added versatility over the Maximus. Maximum shared memory is more permissive (1700mb vs 500mb); you can attach many screens to your motherboard video outs (especially using DP splitters) without worrying about running out of framebuffer. SATA Express connector available, offering compatibility with one of the fastest available connections to external drives. More SATA connectors available on a separate controller helps to alleviate potential I/O bottlenecks at the controller level if you install your HDDs intelligently.  More and faster m.2 connectors - has 2, one of which is the newer, faster Ultra type More and more intelligently-placed fan headers. It is worth noting, though, that the AsRock's fan headers are mostly 3-pin, while the Maximus enjoys mostly 4-pin fan controllers, which usually gives the computer access to better speed control for fans that support 4 pin connections.   All in all, I think the features you get with the AsRock board outweigh the Maximus' brand name even at the same price, given that both these boards are well made. The added versatility is something that will make this board a workhorse for you or whoever else owns it long past the days when it can serve as a gaming rig's basis.
I don't know any white sound machine that also does alarm clock. You didn't specify any price range so I assume we'll go for a middle range.  In this case, I'd recommend the Marpac Dohm-DS (https://www.amazon.com/Marpac-Dohm-DS-All-Natural-Machine-Actual/dp/B000KUHFGM) which is around 50â‚¬ and has the advantage to create its own sound with an internal fan instead of only playing recored sounds. However there isn't any sound selection.  If you are looking for more than one sound, you may consider the Lectrofan (https://www.amazon.com/LectroFan-White-Noise-Machine-Options/dp/B00JU8P8VY) which for the same price offers 10 fan sounds and 10 white noises.  These are the two I know, you can find them inside a tiny article I just found (http://www.nosleeplessnights.com/best-white-noise-machine-reviews/), that presents also two others machines (a high end, ~100â‚¬, and a low-end, ~20â‚¬).
Crossfire is a little more forgiving than SLI. You can crossfire these cards together, but you should be warned that doing so means being hamstrung by the maximum values of the weaker card.  For example, you will have the computational power of two 370s (minus crossfire overhead), but you will be stuck with a maximum of 2GB of VRAM. Depending on what you are pushing through these cards, your performance could very well decrease significantly.
Let's start saying that your setup seems really more-than-good, even of i would go with an Intel Core i7-6700K, and 1 SSD (256GB) and 2 HDD (1TB or + each) cause today's games tent to "eat" many and many Gigs.  BUT the i5 processors are a really good deal for gaming and you sure did your counts about what you need for the storage parts, those was only advices from my personal point of view.  As per your motherboard choice, i can point you here:  Asus Z170 Pro Gaming   It has the latest chipset and it's kinda futureproof 'cause it has the 1151 CPU socket (the i7 mentioned above has the same socket) and it also supports DDR4 Ram (up to 64GB)  There it comes the answer to your "Bonus question";  For the RAM choice, my advice would be:  Kingston HyperX Fury DDR4 16GB (2x8GB) @ 2666MHz  I think there's no much to explain here, everything is in the product description.  That's all, hope this helps and if you need any other advice, feel free to ask! :)
The best answer here is to put into this what it is worth - which is basically a low-end gaming system by today's standards. Dropping one of the hexacore CPUs into this will likely represent an investment simply not worth the returns, since those CPUs are highly sought after now that they are out of production and command a high price on a resale circuit - so much so that newer, cheaper chips from AMD and Intel beat them out.   However, given that the above is not actually the ANSWER to your question, the ANSWER lies on the CPU support page for your mobo's revision level: the most powerful processor available to you is the Phenom II X6 1090T. The AMD Phenom II X6 1100T May also work, but it is not officially supported by the BIOS, so I can't say definitively that it will work. It will probably work. Be careful, because there are Phenoms made which exceed the TDP rating for your board and could easily damage it.  What GPU will be bottlenecked/not bottlenecked by this CPU? All of them; that's not how bottlenecking works. Different programs place different strains on different parts of a computer, so even a high end CPU can be the bottleneck of a low-end GPU if it is trying to do something like downscale an h.265 video transcode, which is highly CPU-intensive, or play a game like Civilization 5, which is notorious for its high CPU usage in the late game but places relatively low demands on GPUs.  Because the CPUs available to this board are somewhat weak compared to modern offerings in a similar price bracket, it makes sense to get an Nvidia GeForce GPU instead of an AMD Radeon GPU, because historically Nvidia driver overhead (the load placed on the CPU when the GPU is running) has been higher for AMD products. This is not a major consideration, however, so price is a major determinant.  The onboard GPU is of no consequence for your purposes unless you want to attach a second screen to it; then it would make a little more sense to go with Nvidia for your primary GPU just so you could have a driver environment all from one supplier, which should be a little more stable (not necessarily though, since you will need to run two separate drivers and that old motherboard GPU may not have Windows 10 compliant drivers).  With a 1090T CPU and a decent overclock to something like 4ghz on all six cores, given a Titan X GPU (not a recommendation, just a removal of most GPU bottlenecks for hypothetical purposes); this system should be able to handle most modern games at maximum settings; a notable exception would be any title which is heavily single-threaded and demanding on the CPU (most bad console ports, for example, of which Assassin's Creed: Black Flag and Unity are shining examples). In general, the CPU is less a limiting factor in gaming PCs than the GPU. Tests have been done showing the lowly Athlon 5350 performing admirably when paired with a midrange modern GPU. Where you are comfortable in that gradient of performance is largely up to personal taste.
One cheap option would be the D-Link DIR-632. It supports all of the above requirements, save perhaps "management of at least 12 devices possible," using dd-wrt firmware, possibly also stock firmware. I can't think of a reason why it wouldn't support 12 managed devices simultaneously, so I think it is a good suggestion.   It is worth noting that this is in a totally different class of devices from your Lancom WLC-4006+, which is not a router or a switch but a WLAN Controller, which is designed to manage connections to wireless APs.   Resource on configuring it to work with certificates under dd-wrt.
The 480 is not a bad choice for that rig especially that the pc is not meant for heavy gaming. But if you wanted a little more performance you could also go Nvidia and get the new GTX 1060 which performs just a littlebit better than the 480 or if you wanted outstanding performance for the same ~$250 price point you could also get the GTX 970 which would be a really good pair for your CPU, but keep in mind, that is now a generation behind the latest GPUs from Nvidia. Of course all of the aforesaid GPUs offer very high end performace for editing and I don't think you would regret getting either one of them.
I would recommend you take a look at Synology. I have a DS216+ and im very happy with it. Its a bit over your budget.  They also have a "j" version thats $160 here: https://www.amazon.com/Synology-DS216j-NAS-DiskStation/dp/B01BNPT1EG/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1469742885&sr=1-2&keywords=synology+ds216  and "se" thats even cheaper.  Should be able to do everything you need. If you do install Plex on it, im not sure what performance you will get, because i have the "+" model its a bit more powerful. (you will be able to stream for sure, im not sure about transcoding)   more specs here: https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/DS216j  https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/DS216se
Anything you find for PCI would probably be for dedicated servers, and thus would not have any 3D acceleration capabilities.   The problem with PCI (non-Express) is that the bus simply does not have the throughput and latency required to render graphics at modern resolutions with modern techniques (window compositing, OpenGL / DirectX accelerated font and canvas rendering, etc.) so anything you find for PCI is going to be so slow and so old that you will get a "software only", Microsoft Basic Graphics ("VESA") driver on Windows 10. This is not a recipe for a good experience. Direct3D and OpenGL, if they run at all, will be unusably slow on this software-only driver.  I therefore suggest you go with AGP. Pretty much the highest-end proper GPU (with 3d acceleration capabilities, DirectX 9.0c, etc.) with an AGP connector is the Nvidia 6800GT / 6800 Ultra series. This card was manufactured til 2007 or so as I recall (released in 2005?), and there are plenty of working specimens available (new or used) in the aftermarket. You will not be able to buy a brand new one direct from major vendors like Amazon though; it's simply too old.  Luckily, Nvidia released the 309 series drivers with full support for WDDM on Windows 8, and the 6800 series cards are supported. Thus you will be able to get at least a WDDM 1.0 / 1.1 driver on this card. The Windows 10 installation may tell you that you're getting the Microsoft Basic Graphics adapter, but then you can install the R309 graphics driver installer from Nvidia and it should load the Windows 8 driver on Windows 10.  AMD (nee ATI) has a similar story with contemporaneous hardware if you prefer the red team, but I'm not sure if the drivers are even available, let alone as current as the Nvidia drivers (the R309 legacy driver was released in 2015). I recall AMD declaring that they would stop supporting old cards a long time ago. They've been in a GCN-only support mode (Radeon 7000 series and later) since about 2012-2013 IIRC.  The research I've done on AMD has indicated that the last driver available for their most-recent AGP cards was released.... in 2010. A full five years older than the latest driver from Nvidia for their AGP cards! It may not even be a WDDM 1.0 driver; I don't have the hardware to even try this driver to know whether it's the XP graphics driver model or the WDDM. If it's WDDM you should be able to peel off the packaging that says "This OS isn't supported" and force-install it on Windows 10 by directly loading the .sys files, but it may be a complicated procedure, so good luck with that.  In summary I wouldn't recommend AMD because their driver support for very old hardware is not as good as Nvidia's.
You're talking about the Edison. It is an Intel SBC with most functionality offloaded to breakout boards connecting to the Edison via a bus on its underside. Has a dual core 500mhz Atom processor by Intel onboard which is x86.  AFAIK they are still in production. The breakout board will probably cost you more than the SBC, though.
I'm going to recommend the Lenovo Yoga P40. After looking at some other stuff from Dell that also offers wacom-style input, I was unable to really get a feel for whether or not certain models supported wacom input or not, so I can't recommend them. Some users appear to have gotten excellent results out of ~800 machines from Dell, but again - I can't be certain which exact model to recommend.  The Yoga is the only reasonably priced, reasonably powerful option on your list. It will be a very powerful machine, is upgradeable, and does satisfy the wacom requirement. While its GPU may not yet be listed by Adobe, I have good confidence that it will work well with Adobe, since it is a professional-tier chip.   The M500M is a mobile chip, so of course it doesn't have all the power you might expect from a standard desktop solution, but it is a midrange professional card and would represent a big step up from your current i5 integrated graphics. Here's how it compares to the primary graphics solutions in your other two options:   The 940M represents the approximate GPU of the Surface Book as evaluated by Cnet  The color issue I was also unable to resolve.  The only other advice I can offer is to look into OBS when recording with your Lenovo. It can use the Nvidia encoder built into the M500M to make streaming a breeze.
OK, to give you a solid understanding of which Yubikey you need you first need to understand what each single one can offer you.  In principle, there are three "levels" of functionality regarding the Yubikeys.  Level 1: U2F  All Yubikeys offer support for the U2F authentication protocol which was originally designed as a secure, anonymous second factor authentication protocol, which is deployed among others with Google, Dropbox and GitHub. Usually (I don't own one, so I can't say 100% for sure), this won't save you from entering any passwords, because it's usually only employed as second defence, especially against phishing attacks.  Level 2: OpenPGP and FIPS 201  This feature set is offered by the Yubikey Neo and the Yubikey 4. It includes integration into PGP based email encryption and signature services such as GPG and allows you to "enforce" hardware access for email signature / decryption. Furthermore they implement the FIPS 201 standard, which means you can also use your Yubikey for encryption, authentication and signature - also using the PKCS#11 library OpenSC - possibly even for windows log-in. However chances are that only very few webservices will make use of such certificate based authentication because it brings a lot of other cost with it, and you'd probably still have to authenticate to the token with a PIN or something... The difference between the Yubikey 4 and the Neo is that the 4 supports stronger crypto algorithms than the Neo (although the Neos are nowhere near broken).  Level 3: NFC  This feature is only offered by the (somewhat dated) Yubikey Neo and thus this is the only one being compatible with phones. So if you need your yubikey on your phone, you have to pick up the Neo.  TL;DR: If you're not interested in fancy crypto features and don't need NFC the cheapest yubikey will probably serve you best, and if you want hardware-backed email encryption and similar applications the more expensive ones are at least worth a look.
I am using the UleFone Power, which is my second UleFone and I am more than happy with both.  It has a 6,500 mAH battery and gives me up to 5 days between charges.  HOWEVER, I am not a heavy data user like you.  That said, you ought to be able to get a full day's use from it. It is reasonably priced, so well worth trying. Let us know what you think
Of the three notebook options you've provided, I'd personally go with i3 5005u. Using cpuboss.com, it is clear that the i3 has significantly better single core and multi-core performance than the Pentium n3700. You probably won't need the extra performance for web browsing and document editing, but it will come in handy in a situation where a little more processing power is needed. Also in performance, the i3 has a higher integrated gpu perfomance than the Pentium, which should help with improving video playback (1080p @ 60fps) and multi-screen. Furthermore, Intel ark says that the i3 supports 16gb of ram compared to 8gb which the Pentium supports. This gives "upgradability" for the future, just in case.   Hope this was helpful :D  (sources: intel ark, cpu boss)
I can answer your question. In terms of CPU utilization, there are three kinds of programs the average computer user will encounter:   Programs that don't use very much CPU at all (most programs) Programs that use only one thread of a CPU heavily (a few programs) Programs that use all threads of a CPU heavily/evenly (a few programs)   So what does that mean for you? It means that for everyday usage, you will see absolutely no difference between the i3 and the i5 in question. While the i3 does indeed have a higher single thread score than the i5 - and suffers from two fewer cores - it uses hyperthreading, so in fact it has four threads it can execute programs on simultaneously, the same as the i5. I'm not going to get into why hyperthreaded threads are not as desirable as fully physical threads here, but suffice it to say this is kind of like a middle ground between a true dual core and a true quad core when it comes to multithreaded performance.  So what programs will actually see a benefit from that i3's higher single thread performance, anyway? The answer for most users is precious few. Older computer games, some parts of photo editing software performance, a few OS operations... I really can't think of anything else. There are lots of programs that are still single-threaded, it's just that most of them fall into category 1 - you won't see ANY benefit past the point of, say, a Pentium 4 @ 3.4ghz!   On the other hand, what programs will see benefits from the full four cores of the i5? Again, the answer for most users is precious few. The OS itself sometimes uses all four threads heavily, zipping/unzipping files is often a heavily multithreaded process, and watching HTML5 video or webms can sometimes see fairly high multicore utilization, especially if more than one plays at a time... but (and this is another wrinkle to the answer) since both of these CPUs in question feature GPUs with Intel's Quicksync video encoding technology built-in, handling some of the most demanding multithread CPU work a modern user might commonly encounter, having to do with HD video playback, encoding, etc - there will be much less of a difference between the two processors than the simple multithreaded benchmark score would intuitively seem to indicate.   The one caveat to all of this is that if you are a true multitasker - if you have more than one demanding task going at any given time - the i5 is probably going to be a better bet for you. For example, if you wanted to zip a large file while simultaneously transcoding media being cast to your TV and using a word processor on a large document - that might warrant the more powerful CPU.   For the average daily user who simply wants to listen to music while watching a youtube video with about 20-30 chrome tabs open in the background and maybe a torrent going - both of these CPUs are huge overkill. You could step all the way down to something like an A8-7600 or a Celeron G1840 without noticing much, if any, performance degradation. In fact, for the average daily user, something like the A8-7600, which can run at a 45W TDP and which sports superior integrated graphics, is probably a much better choice than either of these CPUs, because it is more efficient and sports a more balanced design (a good mix of single-thread, multi-thread, and GPU power).  Choosing between the two processors asked about, however, I'd have to recommend the i3-6320. It's cheaper, and since nothing else really stands out as being particularly great for the basic home user when it comes to the i5, there's no reason for me to suggest you buy it.
From expeience Gigabyte motherboards have been really easy or more straight forward to get working.  An amazing CPU you can get maybe Intel 6700k, that is really high powered and future proof.  Since this list contains an updated: CPU and Motherboard you will need to get DDR 4 memory.  So lets start with this combiniation:   CPU: Core i7 6700k [4 cores][8 threads]: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012M8LXQW MOTHERBOARD: Gigabyte GA-Z170X-UD5 TH http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160ITSSU/ RAM: G.SKILL Ripjaws X (this specific package is 2x 8GB sticks): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006T0CHLA/   Since i do not see a budget, i think these two will be a great combinaton. This is the combination of components i picked out for my fathers hackintosh system.   Here is the link to installation: http://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/success-hackintosh-i7-ga-z170x-ud5-th-i7-6700k-gigabyte-gtx-970.192392/  Now im going to answer your other points from here on.   Software Development: 6700k has fast single and multi core performance so it should be a piece of cake for this CPU to compile applications on. Photoshop: 6700K has intergrated graphics cabablities, but since you have a GTX 970, no reall hardware accelerated problems i can see arrising. 3D Modeling Software: Just like Photoshop i would say most of these applications have hardware acceleration built so they can take advantage of your GPU, but as far as rendering you should have some pretty decent rendering times of your 3d models. Hackintosh: Like i mention above, my father has these paired components in his hackintosh build, and there have been other people who have had a succesful time with thise two parts. Gaming: 6700k as mentioned before is a powerful single and multicore performing chip and since you have an GTX 970, you are pretty solid since a it seems games are trying to use as mush of the GPU and little of the CPU as possible.   Hope this help. :)
Here's what I'd do:  (CPU price off Newegg, Other two off Amazon)  CPU: AMD FX-6300 replace with AMD FX-9590 8 core 4.7 GHz (+$189.99)  CPU Cooler Thermaltake NiC C5 120mm Untouchable CPU Cooler 230W TDP (+48.63) this cooler is a bit tall, so make sure it'll fit in your case  GPU: MSI GAMING GTX 960 4GB OC Twin Frozr-V HDCP Ready SLI Support (GTX 960 GAMING 4G) (+$238.57)  Total is:  $477.19  Hope this helps :D  n.b. since you didn't list all your parts, you might want to double check that 500W is enough, it should be though...
You might consider the Zalman CNPS5X PERFORMA off Amazon for $25.91. It's not too loud at 100% speed and I was able to use it to cool an i7 6700k being stress tested at 4.6Hz (I was getting about 85C - 90C) (I've also upgraded since then). All in all, it's a great cooler, installation is super easy, you literally just snap it in, you don't need to take the motherboard out.  Hope this helps :D  n.b.  It supports LGA 775, not 1366.     Zalman CNPS5X PERFORMA
I'm going to make an uncommon recommendation on the basis that while you may not have heard of this brand or solution, it is definitely what I believe you need. I recommend the DEEPCOOL GAMMAXX 300 120mm CPU Cooler for Intel.   I've used Deepcool fans before so I know that they are decently built and quiet if installed correctly. Moreover, this design fits not only socket 775 but also socket 1366, so it will be adaptable to your needs (it's even rated for up to 130W TDP CPUs, which covers almost the entire range of CPUs on either socket). Finally, it costs less than the competition mentioned so far - at $17.99, it's a good deal.   The only potential downside to this cooler I can see is a relatively large height (135.7 mm) and (possibly) poor overclocking performance relative to the standard of our age, the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo (which is not a quiet solution by any means), due to its inferior heat pipe configuration.   Deepcool GAMMAXX
What a coincidence, I've also got a RPi Zero. Check this out on Amazon.com,  "Edimax EW-7811Un 150Mbps 11n Wi-Fi USB Adapter"  It's only $8.99. It says it's compatible with RPi and RPi 2. I personally have the wifi dongle that came with the adafruit RPi Zero Starter Pack (which is about $11 w/o shipping).   Hope this is helpful :D
If I were to use 2 way crossfire (two of the same GPU) does that mean I can now use 6 screens (three on each card)?   No. The only way to use the additional 3 video outputs on the other card would be to run it without crossfiring it. You can run multiple GPUs in a computer without needing to crossfire them.   If I can only use 3 screens, would I plug the screens into the graphics card closer to the CPU or further from the CPU?   It doesn't matter. AFAIK, crossfire and SLI are smart enough to recognize which card is intended as the master - that is, whichever has the video outs attached.   Do I need a crossfire bridge for the graphics cards?   Not for modern GPUs on modern motherboards which are crossfire certified. It may also work in other circumstances that are less well-defined, but your GPU and motherboard should not require a crossfire bridge.  Addendum:  I feel like noting that your CPU has its own GPU, and your motherboard has 3 or four video outs of its own. If all you are trying to do is run more than three screens, not all of which will be used for gaming, then you could run up to three screens off of this integrated GPU if you enabled it in BIOS. You would need to install Intel graphics alongside AMD's, but that should present no problem. This way, you could support up to six monitors without needing to add a second GPU.  Additionally, you could add another small GPU with three video outs - like an R7 240 or GT 730 - which could be used alongside your other GPU systems to provide a further 3 screens - up to nine.  NOTE: As it currently stands, your GPUs will all need to use a displayport connection for connecting a third monitor. This is something that needs to have an active adapter dongle attached to it if you will be using it to push a signal to a screen which does not support displayport (e.g. it uses VGA, DVI, or HDMI inputs exclusively).
The 2 answers above are good answers, but I thought I'd add what I actually went for in the end.  I bought an Akasa Nero 3, which has the push-pin style mounts for LGA775 / LGA1366. (They are adjustable with a sliding pin.)  I like this fan because it's fairly light weight (which is important as I move my computer to and from different rented accommodation regularly), inexpensive and fairly quiet. (Much quieter than the stock intel cooler. I can hear my GPU fans idling now.)  In addition, the 4 heatpipes are in direct contact with the CPU... They aren't polished quite as nicely as more expensive coolers, which perhaps means their performance is slightly reduced, however they are in direct contact so there isn't an additional metal component for heat to diffuse through, so I think overall it's probably got quite good performance.  I managed to overclock my i7 920 to 4.2 GHz before it just got too hot to overclock further... I didn't even have to change the voltages... Presumably it would go even higher, but it would need an even bigger cooler! By lowering the multiplier I reached a base clock of about 220 MHz. Here I was limited by the motherboard or CPU becoming unstable. Increasing the voltages didn't help... I suspect it may be the motherboard limiting here, but I'm not sure.
Theoretically, the ASRock QC5000-ITX/PH will get you to      4K x 2K (4096x2160) @ 30Hz   But I don't know. I've built seven or eight rigs with that board inside of it and I would say my confidence level is low. The Pentium J3710 - even less so. It doesn't support DP 1.2, so it can't do "real" 4K. AsRock claims     4K x 2K (3840x2160) @ 30Hz   For that board.  All of this is really low-power stuff, as you might expect from an embedded system. A non-embedded equivalent with slightly more oomph, which might just be enough to drive a 4k30 display, would be something like an Athlon 5370 on the ASRock AM1H-ITX motherboard. But that STILL doesn't get you hardware RAID.  HDMI 2.0 appears to be available on Skylake motherboards, or at least some kind of HDMI technology which offers full 4K, but unfortunately it doesn't get you 30hz; only 24hz.  There's no one motherboard with an embedded chip on the market that gets you all of what you want.   BUT, there is a very similar solution:  PCPartPicker part list: http://pcpartpicker.com/list/GGs7TH Price breakdown by merchant: http://pcpartpicker.com/list/GGs7TH/by_merchant/  CPU: AMD A8-7600 3.1GHz Quad-Core Processor  ($71.99 @ SuperBiiz)  Motherboard: MSI A68HI AC Mini ITX FM2+ Motherboard  ($81.98 @ Newegg)  Memory: Klevv Urbane 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-2400 Memory  ($35.99 @ Newegg)  Other: Belkin Miracast Video Adapter (Supports HDMI 2.0) ($59.99) Total: $249.95 Prices include shipping, taxes, and discounts when available Generated by PCPartPicker 2016-08-02 14:55 EDT-0400   This fits in your current case and runs on your current PSU, with your current storage solutions. It supports RAID 0/1/10 off the FCH's SATA controller for all four possible SATA connections, and, while it cannot do a hardwired 4K connection, it supports a CPU and wireless solution with the oomph and the technology necessary to drive a 4k60 connection to your TV in true, full 4k resolution, with the help of the Belkin Miracast Video Adapter. The wireless card connects in the 5ghz frequency range with the adapter, which is plugged directly into the HDMI 2.0 port on your TV, and then you enable miracast using a charm in Windows 8.1 or 10 (or on any Android device with an OS of 4.2 or higher). Apparently this also works in linux via the MiracleCast software, but I'm not confident in that. It is true that this would require a second connection (either using the built-in ethernet or another wifi adapter in a USB or PCI-E port) to actually get online content onto your screen, but I'm guessing due to the RAID requirement that this is not a big deal.   Of course, this is NOT embedded and NOT passively cooled, so if that's a dealbreaker then I guess we are SOL. I'm hoping that it isn't since your current build seems not to be.  This was the only solution I could find which comes close to what you're looking for. It is true that you could use this dongle with an Intel system that supported Miracast, and there may be other similar HDMI 2.0 miracast adapters out there, but this was the configuration which seemed best-supported and most cost-effective from my point of view. Let me know if you have any questions.
I have never heard of such a dB limiting device.  Hmm.. I guess another way you could get around this problem is by "calibrating" your headphones using a sound level meter and an online frequency generator. Figure out what volume on your computer is 85dB on your headphones, and never pass that volume limit on your computer. E.g. Volume set at 40 on my computer is = 85dB max. You would have to repeat this process for different headphones. You would also have to make sure that when testing, the volumes of programs and websites are set to 100, ensuring that your main system volume is like a "master" volume control.  I'd buy an actual sound level meter and not use an app on my phone. Some sound level meters run for about $18 on Amazon.  Alternatively, you could build such a device using arduino, rpi or a soundboard, if you have the experience...  Hope this helps :D
I've been searching, from what I can find, it's nearly impossible to get a pre-built computer for under $800 with a video card with 4GB of VRAM. All of the other specifications are easy to achieve for less.  If it consoles you, the difference between 2GB and 4GB of VRAM in low end cards is negligible to nonexistent. Therefore, the pre-built computer I recommend to you contains a 2GB GT 730.    Dell Inspiron 3650 - US - UK   Price: $619.99 USA, Â£439 UK CPU: i5-6400, 2.7Ghz base, 3.3Ghz turbo. GPU: GT 730, 2GB VRAM Disk: Generic 1TB 7200RPM HDD RAM: Generic 1x8GB DDR3L-1600Mhz WiFi: 802.11 b/g/n    Dell Inspiron 3650    Some Stuff  If you were thinking - "oh the high end graphics cards have 4GB of VRAM, so 4GB of VRAM automatically classifies a GPU as good," you were completely and totally wrong. In fact, if you were to custom build a computer, a 2GB GTX 960 would be vastly superior to a 4GB GT 730, and the performance difference between the 4GB GT 730 and the 2GB GT 730 would be practically nonexistant.  In case you still doubt this, here is a link to a 3DMark Firestrike benchmark comparison  Both graphics cards have 2GB VRAM.  Furthermore, clock speed also doesn't dictate performance. Intel has a vastly superior IPC (Instructions per cycle) than AMD, and therefore can provide incredibly higher levels of performance with a 2.7Ghz clock speed than AMD can with 3Ghz or even 4Ghz.  Cinebench scores:  2.7Ghz i5-6400, quad core: 521  3.5Ghz FX-6300, hexa core: 412  You can see how clock speed, and even amount of cores bow down before IPC in the benchmark above.  Therefore, I think that this will have plenty of power, and I have proved that even if there were a way to make the GPU have more VRAM and the CPU more clock speed, it would not matter.  Hopefully you take these benchmarks and tips into consideration when purchasing.    If this does not suit your needs, please notify me. If there is a particular reason you need exactly 3Ghz clock speed or 4GB VRAM, also please notify me.
I recommend the Juice Bar portable speakers.  I've had one of these for about half a year, and I've been very happy with the quality of both the build and the audio - and that's coming from a professional sound engineer! They've also got great range - I managed 20m indoors, through brick walls, and around 35-40m outdoors. They're available in a range of colours.  Current price in the UK is just under Â£40, which is US$52 as I write this. Not the cheapest, but they're certainly worth the money.
Buy the last option. This RAM is faster and cheaper than the rest. The others cost more because they are being sold through other vendors who can't or don't want to compete on price. The higher price of the Samsung RAM in general can probably be attributed to compatibility; that RAM is commonly used in OEM systems and therefore will have good compatibility with many systems people own. The Transcend RAM modules on display above will also have good compatibility, but they may not be officially vetted by the OEMs, so they are less desirable to businesses and such.   In any case, the correct RAM choice for you is the last option. Even if your laptop doesn't support 1600mhz RAM, it should slow itself down to 1333mhz automatically.
Compatibility wise, your motherboard will need a PCI Express x16 slot. You need to make sure that it actually fits into the case, since some more powerful GPUs have fans to cool them, and can be fairly large. Lastly, you need to make sure that your power supply has enough headroom above what the existing components are drawing to power your graphics card.
From Amazon.com  5200mAh Long Standby Rugged Mobile Phone with Waterproof Shockproof Dustproof Unlocked Phone for Elderly People Adventurers Army Cellphone(Black)  It's $50, and can call and send/receive sms. 5200mAh battery w./ 72 hours talk time and 360 hours standby (as the manufacturer claims). I'm pretty sure the screen is color though.
One way you might be able to accomplish your goal is buying purchasing any Canon Powershot Camera, let's say... the sx510hs and "hack" it with CHDK. You can download CHDK here. Unfortunately, most Canon Powershots mount using the "standard" 1/4" 20 thread screw.  I'm not sure if this is exactly what you are looking for, but with CHDK, you can run scripts that control the camera in LUA or BASIC on your camera.  Hope this helps! :D
I use a Jabra Speak 510, very good sound quality, can do much more than just speaker but a little expensive (about 100â‚¬)  Edit for details : battery YES, autonomy more thant 10 hours, USB and jack 3.5mm port Size : round, diameter about 10cm for 2.5cm height Link : http://www.jabra.co.uk/business/speakerphones/jabra-speak-series/jabra-speak-510
As long as electrical bills are not a problem and you're going to get more than one GPU anyway, you should get the four GTX 1080s.    The reason this is the better choice is because it provides better flops per dollar amount than any other option (at least on the Nvidia side; a real pity that Theano only seems to see OpenCL work on CPU for the future; AMD options could really go to town if the work could be given to them in an OpenCL format).  Theano uses FP32 calculations, and it can support multiple GPUs (still somewhat experimentally).  One final thing to note: the GTX 1080 uses DDR5 for its vRAM, not the DDR5X as earlier speculated. AFAIK the same should be true for the Pascal Titans.   An edge case where I might be wrong about this would be if you were going to be usually running fewer than 3 parameter sets simultaneously, because then the two more powerful Titans would be a better choice. I think that will ultimately end up being very unlikely, however, so I'm not going to let it influence my answer. If OP knows otherwise he should definitely speak up.
I am a big fan of my old G80-8200, which you can find on ebay.de for around the price you're buying at.    If you can get past the useless card scanner, there's a lot to like about this keyboard - fully reprogrammable keys, lots of extra function keys you can assign stuff to, and lots of clear caps so you can define your own illustrations for your caps. In addition, there are editions of this keyboard which come with the excellent Brown switches, which as others have noted, are similar to your clears. Of course, since these are Cherry MX switches we're talking about, keep in mind that if you MUST have clear switches, it's possible to buy a switch set and swap out the old switches for your new clear set.
Oh my, a question targeting my hardware experience AND my more than passing interest in cognitive science!  I have a friend who is currently dying from Muscular Dystrophy. In the end stage of this disease, he is barely able to move any part of his body. He and I investigated several consumer-grade EEG devices as a means of him controlling computers (none ended up working for him as well as voice command). In the course of that investigation, we initially rejected the NeuroSky MindWave Headset, but I am returning to it now as an ideal solution to your problem.  While it has a pretty crappy sensor configuration, it is my understanding that seizures are large events which any EEG machine should be able to detect relatively easily. The upside to this machine is that it is cheap and relatively unobtrusive compared to other available brands. Moreover, this device is able to interface with mobile devices via bluetooth and does have a developer's kit app for Android available for purchase. I'm not going to go into how you solve the software side of this problem, because this is a hardware recommendation only (as befits the site), but I trust since you are inquiring you'll know where to go from here.
I recommend the AMD FirePro W7100 Professional Graphics Card.    It supports 4 monitors It has 8gb DDR5 vRAM Since it is not made by an OEM we can expect it to conform to AMD spec that hackintosh is relying on in order for it to work It is rated for less than 150W TDP, so it fits within the 300W envelope your Mac Pro is rated for - you could even have two of them Since it is a pro card it is particularly suited to the type of work you are doing and is very stable and well-supported compared to gaming cards like the R9 390 It is not hideously expensive compared to other, better FirePro cards available It is relatively new, so you shouldn't miss out on any newer features like VCE
First of all, I have to say, on this topic, I definitely agree with Adam Wykes who had made a comment earlier that parts in prebuilt computers are not always chosen in the best configuration and that building a computer yourself would get you a better price to performance ratio, to say nothing of you getting the advantage of choosing what parts you would like to save on and which ones you would like to pick a really high-end one of. Besides it might be intimidating at first but it is honestly not that hard to build a PC...  However, I am guessing you heard this enough and your question was very straight forward, you asked for a prebuilt desktop.  Now, I also don't think (solely based on what you said you were going to use the PC for) that you need 4 GB of VRAM but if you do for some specific reason here you go:  http://m.newegg.com/Product/index?itemnumber=N82E16883227670  Though, I realize the included mouse and keyboard combo makes the device look really cheap, keep in mind that iBUYPOWER PC is a really reputable brand, and even if it was not the parts are only put together by them not made by them.  Now, if you getting 4 GB of VRAM wasn't a necessity for you you could get a computer that still offers a great performance but does not push the limits of tour budget as much like this:  http://m.newegg.com/Product/index?itemnumber=N82E16883102038  This is one of those rare prebuilt desktops that are actually worth their price and also offer a good configuration of components.  Also, I was surprised that nobody else in the comment section found anything like these, so I would like to apologize in advance if I missed any of your criteria that the above linked computers might not meet. I do not know how international shipping can be arranged with newegg, but I'm sure it can be solved somehow.
So, there's no budget, so I'm going to stay below $1500. If you have a specific price point to stay below, please comment and I will add more answers.    Dell XPS 15 95501   Price: $1400 CPU: i7-6700HQ RAM: 8GB DDR4-2133 Disk: 256GB PCIe SSD GPU: GTX 960M Size: 15.6" screen, 13.3" chassis. Screen: 1920 x 1080, no touch (touch available) (Not IPS!)

They are not expected to reach the same frequencies, though for most overclockers it is close enough that a significant price difference is not warranted.  In silicon chip manufacturing there is a process called binning, wherein tests at the factory sort chips according to the quality of their manufacture. The highest quality chips - the highest "binned" examples - are the ones which will respond most positively to overclocking, because they don't skirt the QA lines on any of their specifications. Those chips are usually not simply thrown back in with the rest of the batch and sold so that some customers get lucky with OCing and others don't - the higher binned chips are used to create the higher-tier SKUs, and within those SKUs, the best of the best are used to create the OEM overclocked models. Those chips are the ones which stand the best possible chance of being monstrously good overclockers - the only pitfall some people fall into is in thinking that the factory overclock indicates the percentage by which they will beat more conventional SKUs - this not an accurate way of thinking, because sometimes OEMs are able to set factory OCs very close to the upper limit of the part's capability.   The last thing to consider is that the OC'd models of GPU often receive some of the best addons an OEM can offer - better caps, better software, backplates, and better cooling solutions. All of that combines to add value to the more expensive models. In some cases, you can see crazy things like OC'd R9 270s outperforming R9 270Xs as a result of this.   The thing to keep in mind when all is said and done, however is this: are you the type of person to worry over your GPU's clockspeed for several weeks, tweaking it and testing it meticulously until you have achieved the best possible result? If not, it probably makes more sense to go for the similar but cheaper model. Factory OCs on their own usually do not offer a sufficient value increase to justify the premiums they are sold at.   I recommend the slower, cheaper version of the card unless you are very passionate about overclocking.
Your question fundamentally breaks down to which motherboard you should go with, because the motherboard will determine the CPU, GPU(s), RAM, and everything else. I'm going to recommend, therefore, that you go with a dual socket 2011 board, like this ASRock EP2C612D16C-4L SSI EEB Server Motherboard, though any other board like it would probably do as well for you.  These boards support a LOT of PCI-E throughput - this particular model supports 3x 16x slots and 2x 8x slots, in a configuration that would allow you to run up to three double-height cards without risers, with the caveat that the top card would need to be an ITX version of whatever card you wanted - these cards are available without a huge price bump for the most of the recent Nvidia GTX lineups. Furthermore, this board supports the socket 2011 HPC Xeon CPUs, which offer extremely performative CPUs with lots of threads for massive parallel work. An example configuration would be something like this, where CPU slot 2 is left open and can be filled later (the CPUs are cheapest on the used market - vastly cheaper, actually). Finally, unlike some other socket 2011 boards, this one does run on DDR4 spec RAM, so that's in line with your request. As it is, it can support up to a theoretical maximum of 1Tb RAM, but more realistically about 512Gb.   Right now, this CPU sits near the absolute top of the performance charts, unless you start getting into E7 Xeons and POWER8/9, I think, and it certainly enjoys a fantastic price/performance ratio thanks to the flood of parts on the used market.
So I know of a local shop called MinMax Custom PCs that will build a very small ITX system called the "MinMax C70-ITX" that probably does meet your needs; I've specced it out as best as I can tell from what they told me - they don't have a a website except for this, or else I'd link you to their own product description - they include a USB stick and USB wireless card as part of their product that I'm not including here in my description, and they sell the whole shebang for $160. What follows is my best attempt to reverse-engineer their design so you can see what kind of system they're offering:  PCPartPicker part list: http://pcpartpicker.com/list/f4D3Z8 Price breakdown by merchant: http://pcpartpicker.com/list/f4D3Z8/by_merchant/  CPU:  Integrated with Motherboard Motherboard: ASRock C70M1 Mini ITX C-Series C-70 Motherboard  ($39.99 @ SuperBiiz)  Memory: Crucial 2GB (1 x 2GB) DDR3-1600 Memory  ($10.99 @ SuperBiiz)  Other:  PicoPSU-80 + 60W Adapter Power Kit ($35.00) Other: New 4 Pin IDE Male Molex to Dual SATA Y Splitter Female HDD Power Adapter Cable ($0.75) Other: M350 Universal Mini-ITX enclosure by Mini-Box Black ($38.63) Total: $125.36 Prices include shipping, taxes, and discounts when available Generated by PCPartPicker 2016-08-08 17:15 EDT-0400   For whatever it's worth, the M350 really is tiny compared to every other ITX box you've ever seen, so they really hit that part of the design out of the park. It's not much bigger than the ITX board itself, and it uses a laptop charger to power the PC instead of a standard ATX PSU, which can be quite bulky (and inefficient) in comparison. It's also fanless, which I find kinda neat, but you might want to add your own fan if it's running in a hot environment as the CPU and the drives are very close inside the case from what I can tell. The big thing here is that because it's x86 and has 2gb RAM, you can run full-blown linux on it if you want. Any RAID would be software-based, doubtless.
You might consider the Dell Precision 15 3000 Series. Meets all of your requirements (maybe except for the big screen requirement)  The entry level model goes for $999 -- Click Here  Some Specs:  Windows 10 Pro  i5 5300HQ Quad Core 2.30GHz base / 3.20GHz Turbo (cpu)  500GB HDD  8GB DDR4 (ram)  AMD FirePro W5130M 2GB (video card)  15.6" Screen  Dell claims it has 17 hour battery life  Hope this helps! :D
Hi I hope this helps you regarding your question if graphics card will used its full potential on pcie 3.0 yes of course especially with the new graphics card that are out today from nvidia and amd. I want to add somethind if your planning to buy gpu try gt1060 from nvidia or rx 470 crossfire from amd. 600 or 700W power supply will be enough for it.  Try looking for this link also. https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Z170-H170-H110-B170-Q150-Q170---What-is-the-Difference-635/
I just found the perfect (I think) board: an Intel NUC board with a 10.16cm squared area and 28.8mm height.  5W TDP, SATA, Gigabit Ethernet, around $100 (for mainboard and integrated CPU). Pity it needs 12V input, this still has me searching for a battery controller.  It only has 1C/1T at 1.46Ghz, but this should be just enough and already a lot faster than a Raspberry Pi.  There are mini PCI-E expansion boards for at least two additional SATA III connections, with the more expensive ones supporting hardware RAID.
If you have a local Microcenter I'd encourage you to take a look at the Dell 7000 series:  There is a model around ~$650 I recently purchased with:    360 degree hinged 2-in-1 i7 6500u 256gb SSD 8GB Ram 1080p touchscreen Windows 10   I use mine for light programming, a fair bit of RDP to my monster desktop, and couch-user type media/browsing activites. I was between this laptop and an XPS-13. The XPS is much smaller and lighter, and all around sexier, but if I were to get the same specs as the Inspiron in the XPS, I'd have spent $1200 instead of $690 and have been left without the touchscreen or 360-degree hinge. I took the hit to size and weight (fairly significant to be honest, the XPS13 is tiny!) and saved plenty of cash for a still-pretty-sleek powerhouse.  The link I gave goes to a similarly specced 15'' system with a 4k display around $900.  Edit: I just re-read your question and this does not meet a number of your requirements (no VGA/HDMI, numpad)
AsRock offers the cheapest sub-ATX sized board that I'd actually try to run QHD at 60Hz on: the ASRock AM1H-ITX. Per AsRock spec, the DP port is 1.2 compliant, so it should be capable of QHD/60hz. Putting an AMD Athlon 5370 in the CPU slot should just about drive that resolution. Not sure I'd risk it with anything lower than that, but if you're the adventurous type, then you can get integrated, very cheap solutions like the ASRock QC5000-ITX/PH or the ASRock J3710-ITX (mind you, I'm not a huge AsRock fan, they just seem to be the ones offering the cheapest, most prolific models in this space. I'm guessing other brands offer solutions here, I just can't seem to find them).   FWIW, it seems that any FM2+, 1150, or 1151 motherboards with a DisplayPort out should all conform to at least DP 1.2, meaning they support your desired display. On the Intel side I'd tend to advise packages with HD 4400 or higher graphics solutions, but it is possible I'm way off base on that and plain old HD graphics will work just fine due to the magic of Intel's Quicksync decoder - but definitely do not try anything from AMD without VCE or from Intel without Quicksync. Those two technologies should be considered mandatory.
I recommend the Rii K12BT Ultra Slim Portable Mini Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard. It does everything you listed (well, it can charge while connected via bluetooth, but close enough), and it is cheap and well-reviewed.
This keybaord: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bluetooth-Keyboard-KVAGO-Backlight-Illuminated/dp/B01G6LA72M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470834872&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=mini+wireless+backlit+keyboard&psc=1 fits all of your criteria: it is small (28.4 x 14.8 x 2.2 cm), it is backlit, is wireless and has a USB cable.  Here are some specs:   Modulation System: GFSK Operating Voltage: 3.0-5.0V Working current: 2.5-3.5MA Standby Current: 0.3mA  Sleeping Current: 0.1mA  Charging Current: 200mA  Working distance: 10m  Uninterrupted work time: 55 to 70 hours  -Charging time: 4-5 hours  Standby time: 60 days  Operating voltage: 3.7~4.2V(Power by Li-on)  Battery capacity without backlight version: 150mah Battery capacity with a backlit version: 400mah Lithium Battery Capacity: 400mA Lithium Battery Life: 3 years Key Strength: 70-90g Key Life: 5 million strokes   Cost: Â£21.
It might be worth it to look into 3.5" drive enclosures. I've got an aluminium one which is a little oversized for a 3.5" drive and which has just the right size for a NUC board and some 2.5" drives (30mm height in total).  It even has a status LED (that's the cable you see) and a kind of sled onto which I can mount stuff.  This might be something you can actually order for $15, but really I meant to give general advice and not a specific product.  It should be   aluminium so it transfers heat outside preferably have this kind of sled so you can screw the NUC board onto it and still get it out of the case
The Motorola MC40N0 provides an android-based barcode scanner system which can access web applications via the android browser wirelessly. It includes a barcode scanner, laser scanner, camera, and magnetic strip reader. Software to utilize the scanning methods should come stock on the included Android ROM, otherwise you'll have to buy a license from Motorola, which will ruin your budget. An older model, it can be found on the used market for cheap.   I owned two of these devices, having found them in a dumpster. After charging them up, both worked fine, though one had a battery that wouldn't charge. Their OMAP 800mhz dual core ARM CPUs were somewhat slow, but sufficient for the job, and the devices were incredibly efficient and long-lasting.
I think you'd have excellent luck with the Raspberry Pi A+ for ~$25. It has excellent documentation, some preexisting servo driver software, and integrated GPIO pins, which are the things you solder the controller wires from your motors to. It does NOT run a real-time environment, so stutter might occur, but for your use case that might not matter. At only $25, it makes sense to try this first and then add something like an Arduino Uno if stuttering IS a problem, since the Arduino will likely need to communicate with the Pi anyway. The big draw here is really the documentation; this is an incredibly well-documented platform with a lot of active users.
I'm going to recommend the HP Deskjet 460c. This printer meets your requirements, though it is not a thermal printer. It supports printing directly from Android via a wifi connection (no router needed AFAIK) using their official free app. It has a bluetooth receiver built in, but I'm not sure whether the app uses it. It comes with a battery.
Well, your request doesn't explicitly specify laptop, so I will make a recommendation for a desktop even though I get the strong feeling you really do want a laptop.  XPS x8900-2506BLK Intel Core i7 6th Gen 6700 (3.4 GHz) 16 GB DDR4 1 TB HDD NVIDIA GeForce GTX  for $889 from Newegg.  And a decent monitor: Asus VE228H 21.5" Full HD HDMI LED BackLight LCD Monitor w/Speakers ASCR 10,000,000:1  $109 from Newegg. You can do a lot with that if you don't mind programming at home. Or, you could use a lightweight device and RDP into the desktop and program away from home.
So just from my experience: you can simply use normal disks as they work exactly as a normal hard disk. I use normal ones in my 24/7 servers since a few years without a failure.  But if you have the money and your data should be really safe from drive failure, you should buy NAS drives. They are built exactly for this purpose and generate, as far as the producing companys tell us, less vibrations, what is positive for the expected lifespan of the drives.
It all depends on what you mean by "very high-end", I am not aware of any consumer applications that would utilize more than 2-3 GPUs, with a single user but if you want to run several of the most demanding applications there are at the same time for some reason, and therefore you need to take everything to the very max, here you go:  http://www.supermicro.com/products/system/4U/4028/SYS-4028GR-TRT.cfm  (This is the highest end server motherboard I could find, with support for the most [8] PCIE 3.0 GPUs.)  You did not make clear your requirements for GPUs, however, but since you are trying to build a "a very high-end" system, I am guessing you would want to go with 8 980TIs, of course you will not be able to run all the graphics cards in SLI (or crossfire if you decide to go with AMD) since neither of the two manufacturers have SLI bridges with support for more than 4 cards.  As for the CPU: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DX5O20W/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=linustechtips-20&ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01DX5O20W&linkCode=as2&linkId=AQM7FRJICIOEDYTX  Now, I would like to note that though I am not exactly sure what you will be using this coputer for, I think it is a total waste of money to build.a system like the one above since, unless there are many users, or a LOT OF very demanding applications being ran at the same time, there is no way you could use up all this power.  Instead I would recommend getting the parts linked below, which will still probably be an absolute overkill for your needs:  Mobo: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O1AXIHM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=linustechtips-20&ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00O1AXIHM&linkCode=as2&linkId=EJA47R5CG7ZOFSSN  Case: http://m.newegg.com/Product/index?itemnumber=N82E16811129218&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-Mobile&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-Mobile--pla--Cases+%28Computer+Cases+-+ATX+Form%29-_-N82E16811129218&gclid=CKrhi_2zvM4CFYcfhgodADABkg&gclsrc=aw.ds  Processors: https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?tag=linustechtips-20&ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=aps&keywords=Intel+5960X&linkCode=as2  Graphics Cards: http://www.vgastore.com/2021301/asus-gtxtitanx_12gd5-geforce-gtx-titan-x-12gb-384-bit-gddr5-pci-express-3-0-hdcp-ready-sli-support-video-card  PSU: http://m.newegg.com/Product/index?itemnumber=9SIA91N4DC5875&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleMKP-Mobile&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleMKP-Mobile--pla--Power+Supplies-_-9SIA91N4DC5875&gclid=CIHOlvq0vM4CFZFZhgod5moDNQ&gclsrc=aw.ds  And any drives and cables of choice...
The best, most energy efficient solution would be a hub dynamo.  A basic model of hub dynamo would be something like the Shimano DH-3N31, available from about â‚¬30. There are more expensive models, which are lighter weight, and a bit less drag. But you probably won't notice much difference anyway, unless you are riding a fast, lightweight bicycle. Note the DH-3N31 is only suitable for rim brakes, there are similar models that work with disc brakes (eg Shimano DH-3D32).  You would need to get the hub dynamo built into a wheel. You could rebuild your existing wheel, to replace the hub, or maybe easier just to buy a complete dynamo wheel. Cost from about â‚¬75, depending on what sort of hub and spokes you want etc.  Then you need something to take the power output from the dynamo, and convert it to a USB output. A good option would be the Busch & MÃ¼ller USB-Werk, for about â‚¬65. This has a built in cache battery, so it can supply constant power to your phone, even if you slow down or stop.  There are also dynamo powered lights, with USB output. This could be useful if riding after dark. Though they are more expensive. eg Busch & MÃ¼ller Lumotec IQ2 Luxos U, for â‚¬120.
If you are looking for a mechanical keyboard, this Drevo fits all your criteria: it has no number pad, it has backlights, and it's Bluetooth-compatible.
My suggestion is the Corsair VOID headset.  Pros  The earcups are a departure from the ubiquitous circular/oval shapes - see the images in the link above. I find it to be an almost perfect fit around the ear without extra space. It's approx 70mm along the longer diagonal. They are circumaural (over-ear/closed cups).    It is very well padded along the headband and on the earcups, with a cloth/mesh covering. They seem fairly large, where I find most other headphones to be too tight.  The mic boom is long and flexible. Many other headsets I've tried have the mic a fair distance from the mouth (shorter, maybe straight only), which is a problem for people who speak softly.  The mic seems to be directional and does a decent job of avoiding most keyboard noise.  Cons  The biggest issue would probably be the CUE software - it has a habit of halving volumes of other programs over time until they hit 0. But the software doesn't really add much value unless you really want to use the macros or lighting controls - if you just want basic audio in/out, you won't need it, as it appears to use standard USB audio drivers. This seems to be fixed as of v 2.x.  It can be a bit heavy for extended listening, weighing in at 375g on the wireless model.  It sits well on the head when looking straight ahead, but can be loose/heavy enough to slip if looking straight down while moving your head.  Other  Sound quality, as always, is subjective. I find it perfectly fine for listening to music, and I've heard no complaints about the mic quality from others.  There are wired and wireless options available. I'm currently using the wireless one, which has decent range with no detectable quality loss or stuttering.
I have a few alternatives, with different pros and cons. I have extensive first-hand experience with each of these products.  SteelSeries Siberia 800 / 840  First, a little history. SteelSeries launched the "H Wireless" headset a couple years ago. It's a wireless headset with a basestation, with a replaceable battery (two of them, in fact, with a charger in the base station), flexible boom mic, and many options for connectivity. It's over-ear, relatively comfortable, but weighs a ton. It depends on being within ~100m of the base station (it's a Class 1 2.4 GHz device) to get wireless functionality, though. You can still use it as normal headphones with a 3.5mm cable.  The Siberia 800 is basically the H Wireless, rebranded and with slight tweaks to the aesthetic.  The Siberia 840 is basically the Siberia 800, but with Bluetooth added as another option in addition to the standard wired connections (USB, 3.5mm and toslink). I emailed SteelSeries to get more details about exactly how their Bluetooth works (is it in the base station or the headset, for one), and will update you when I hear back. I'm betting the Bluetooth transceiver is in the base station, and lets you do things like stream music or calls from your phone to your base station to your headset.  My experience is solely with the H Wireless, but this product family is so incredibly similar to the original H Wireless that I basically have experience with the 840, minus the optional Bluetooth stuff.  Pros:   Two batteries - as long as you keep one charging, you'll never run out of juice. It takes about 5-10 seconds for an experienced user to swap batteries. Sound quality - they seem to use an extremely low latency, lossless codec that's perfectly suitable for real-time gaming. Also, the sound never once dropped out or had any digital artifacts while I was using the H Wireless.  Over-ear and very large - the only possible issue you might have is that the headset feels a little heavy, and may press on your skull with an uncomfortable amount of force. Not sure if they've improved that at all with the new models. But it will definitely encompass your entire ear within the padded cup. No special software is required to use them -- the 3.5mm / toslink / USB sound card options are all pretty standard. I think the Siberia 840 has some support for an EQ or something through SteelSeries' custom software, if you want. Meh.   Cons:   Battery life: Either the battery "fuel gauge" on the base station is wildly inaccurate, or the battery life on these Li-Ion cells deteriorates at a frightening pace with use. It was nice (around 18-20 hours) when first using the headset, but within 3-6 months it was around half that. I generally ran the batteries down to about 25% before recharging them but I never let them drain completely, so when I first got 'em, I was changing battery about once per day, and within 6 months I was changing battery about two to three times for a full day gaming session. SteelSeries refused to sell replacement batteries for the H Wireless. Not sure if that has changed for the Siberia 800 / 840. These cans are a bit pricier than Bob's suggestion (but, thankfully, not quite into the $400-500 price range). Pending the result of my email to SteelSeries, even the 840 might be functionally useless as a wireless headset if you carry it away from the base station. Unless the Bluetooth codec is inside the headset itself, which would be awesome, as these could then double as Bluetooth headphones for music listening and taking calls while on travel (with a smartphone or laptop).   The next suggestion is for Bluetooth headphones with which I have extensive experience (yes, even for gaming) and represents my current personal setup.   Foreword: Whenever you're using Bluetooth in a gaming setup, it is important that both your transmitter and the headphones support AptX Low Latency. Just AptX will not be good enough. The reason is that AptX Low Latency is the only Bluetooth A2DP codec with a low enough latency to be suitable for gaming. Other codecs like AAC and "regular" AptX will sound nice, but the latency is too  high for real-time gaming. You will notice the latency with any other codec, and it will drive you insane!  BeoPlay H8  These headphones are truly as wonderful to wear as the marketing says they are. The marketing is stunningly honest in the way that all of their claims have been very well substantiated by my personal experience with the headphones since May 2016 (over 3 months of daily use as of this writing).  However, there is no implementation of Bluetooth on the market that provides simultaneous, high-quality audio playback and microphone capture. The standard Bluetooth profiles simply do not have anything that would make this possible. The Hands Free Profile (HFP) provides for very low-quality duplex audio, and the A2DP profile provides for very high-quality playback only.  So, in order to build a perfect gaming setup that works with Bluetooth headphones, you're going to need to let go of the requirement to make use of the mic built into the headset, and use a mic on your desk. Some people simply won't be able to accept this, but I find it works extremely well for me.  Also, since I am not aware of any Bluetooth dongles for Windows that support AptX Low Latency (this codec would have to be added to the software Bluetooth stack on Windows), you will have to buy a separate "full stack" Bluetooth transceiver for this setup. Personally I use the Imperial BART 1, but the HomeSpot will work too (make sure to get the model that says AptX Low Latency; there are several different models of device under the same product page on Amazon).  Lastly, for a mic, I just use the Blue Yeti (with a third-party pop filter). The mic is more than sufficient for voice; it's actually suitable for recording indie-grade music (singing and instruments).  Now, on to the pros and cons of the actual BeoPlay H8 headset, keeping in mind my setup above...  Pros:   Quite good battery life, and it seems to be holding up well over time, at least after 3 months. Never any dropouts with the Imperial BART 1 or the Homespot. They do drop out with Android phones, but that's a bug in Android I believe. Truly awesome head feel, very lightweight, and feels extremely sturdy. The cups are on-ear, but the lightness of the headset prevents fatigue pain on the ears. The cups are among the most comfortable I've ever tried on. Perfect, artifact-free active noise cancellation (SO great for immersion!). The passive noise cancellation is also fantastic. Sound quality with AptX Low Latency is basically equivalent to a high-end wired setup, as far as I can hear. It's a combination of the high quality acoustics, the perfect ANC, the drivers, the (lack of) a biased EQ in the DSP (it's very flat) and the high bitrate and very good lossy compression of AptX Low Latency (I understand that it's comparable to at least MP3, possibly with compression ratios approaching AAC, and they use a very generous bitrate with Bluetooth 4.0 or later). The touch controls seem weird at first, but you'll get used to them. Presents a nice, clean human interface without any buttons (except the on/off switch). User-replaceable battery. BeoPlay sells replacement batteries for $50. These should last you a long time. Bluetooth 4.2 -- supports the latest Bluetooth standard, which is good for reliability and range, because they've made some iterative improvements in 4.1 and 4.2 to minimize interference with other 2.4 GHz protocols and even 4G LTE. Dual-purpose: you can stow these in a bag or around your neck and take them on the go with a smartphone, and they're great for making phone calls or listening to music. If you have a smartphone supporting AptX Low Latency (some do), they're even suitable for smartphone/tablet real-time gaming. No voice chat at the same time, though.   Cons:   Bluetooth limitation: no simultaneous A2DP and mic capture :( But this is not specific to this headset. Until the Bluetooth standards body introduces a proper duplex profile, we're stuck with this limitation. Cost. They're definitely a luxury item, and a proper gaming setup requires the purchase of a mic and a Bluetooth AptX LL transceiver, which drives up the cost into the $600+ range ($500 + at least $50 for a decent mic + $50ish for a transceiver). These headphones do have some sound reliability problems after a fairly small range gap between the transceiver and your headphones. I think the BT transceiver in the headset may be Class 2 (10 meters). I can walk into the next room, but sometimes if I try to go out into the hallway and there's a wall or two between me and the transceiver, it'll start to drop out. This is with distances that never caused any sound disruption with the SteelSeries H Wireless, so there are definitely wireless solutions that have longer range than the BeoPlay H8 (this could be a Bluetooth limitation, or it might be particular to these cans, not sure). However, if you have a direct line of sight to the transmitter, you shouldn't have any problems all the way out to 10 meters -- it's only when I put a wall or door between me and the BART 1 that I have any reliability problems.   Conclusion  I basically hate the physical construction of most wireless "gaming" headsets because they think it's cool to use some weird triangular or polygonal shape that doesn't fit my ears at all and leaves huge gaps for air to get in and reduces immersion. They also generally lack ANC, are too heavy, and don't really have audiophile-grade sound production.  Though I can recommend the Siberia 800/840 if you can get over some of these limitations, the real "audiophile gamer" setup in my mind is with the BeoPlay H8. It's just pretty expensive.  Oh, and I don't do wired stuff anymore. I refuse to be wired down. It's great to walk into the next room or go to the bathroom and never miss a beat (especially if you're listening to something live, like a Teamspeak room or a baseball game, and don't want to miss anything).
You're gonna need server-grade PCI-E bandwidth.  IBM-ServeRaid-M5110-8-Port-6Gbps-PCI-e-SAS-SATA-RAID-Controller-81Y4481-81Y4482  you'll need to make sure you get some SAS to SATA breakout cables, but these drives offer serious I/O for a decent price. Consumer grade RAID cards usually fail to satisfy your needs because of insufficient PCI-E bandwidth, while modern equivalents will not really be affordable. In my experience the only difficulty is in making sure you get the drivers (but since they are well-supported this is not really an issue after all).  Small note: if you don't have at least one PCI-E 8x 2.0 connection, you're boned. You may also be boned if you have lots of other devices occupying PCI-E slots.
You can't yet.  There's high frequency monitors but they seem to top out at 1440p in most cases. Some of them may have gsync.  All existing 4k monitors top out at 60hz as far as I know since the 'common' flavours of HDMI (2.0 for TV oriented gear and high end video cards) and DP 1.2) don't have the bandwidth for 4k/UHD and 120hz at the same time.  You'd need to pick one or the other.
I'm writing this with a second hand Lenovo X230 with a 12 inch screen. Cheap, easily repairable and certified by Ubuntu.  The only thing that needed tweaking was the touchpad.
There is no such thing; the adapter simply translates a copper connection between the mircoSD format and the SD format. It has no logic of its own and therefore will simply be as fast as the card you put into it. However, there are faster cards available.
RE: the Silicon Armor units:  If you're talking about "lifetime" when operating in an ideal environment (good temperature, not a lot of hard impacts or water, mostly sitting still on a desk), none of the technical specs really give us any insight into how reliable the drives inside these enclosures actually are.   Typically, a drive that does not suffer from any significant physical trauma or movement while in use will last for 5 to 7 years if used frequently, assuming there are no design flaws artificially limiting its lifespan. Even with military spec protective casing like these models offer, any hard impacts or significant movement while using it will probably reduce its lifespan by a large amount. Hard drives are too precise of an instrument to be thrown around; components will start to fall apart and lose their precision (and fail soon after) in short order.  The only differences I could discern between the units were the levels of military spec (or lack thereof) certification, and the levels of IPX (or lack thereof) certification. The one that supports MilSpec and IPX7 is probably the best overall protected. That'd be the Armor A80.  Also consider that the disks themselves could be low or high-quality, the firmware / disk controller could be low or high-quality; the connector ports could be low or high-quality; etc. which could affect lifespan of the device. If warranty service is not an option, you might want to shop around for more than one vendor. Also consider the opinions of both the original poster and the commenters here and think about whether an Enterprise-grade disk might be better (in some kind of portable enclosure).  --  Since you didn't state any criteria, for the WD disks I'll go with the My Passport Ultra because it's bigger and I (perhaps illogically) think that a larger disk is more likely to have some kind of padding / armor that'll make it more physically resistant to shock. ;-)
I can see only one option: The Linksys WMP600N.  It's capable of operating on the 5ghz band with N technology though it's not going to get the speed boost from that capability - although the interface does seem to be capable of it, the controller isn't.   Then again you just need it to get on the 5ghz band, so you're good.  The last problem for you to overcome is running it on Windows 10, but I think I've got you covered there. Linksys doesn't support the card anymore, but because I was able to determine that it uses the RT2860 chipset by Ralink, I was able to find drivers for the chipset that should work under Windows 10. Mediatek acquired Ralink at some point, it seems, so now they host the old Ralink drivers. Here's yours.
Another possible option: the TL-WN951n also seems to meet these requirements. Unconfirmed on Windows 10 but there's a windows 8 driver for it that might be compatible.
I had a few other suggestions - Kingston was highly recommended, but it wasn't available at the mall I was checking out, and there were a few odd brands I've never seen elsewhere at my local store.  I ended up going with a Razer ManO'War. I admit, one of the reasons I got it is aesthetic - it fits my all black rig well ;p. It also seemed to have the right-sized headband.    Let's start with the features I didn't mention in my original question (some of which are useless). I'm a bit of a Razer fan so the fact that the headset works with synapse is probably a feature. It supports (software emulated) 7.1 audio.  It has what I'm told are the standard on-headset volume controls with push to silence, and it integrates well with an on screen OS for both.  The headset is retractable, and I'm told sound quality is acceptable. (Considering I used an SM 57 before, I wasn't expecting an improvement). Charging is over USB, and the ManO'War comes with a little 'dock' for your transmitter, and a USB charging cable, both of which are the standard 'soft' braided cable Razer uses.  I'm used to lesser audiophile/professional grade headsets. The ManO'War feels light, though the plastic seems sold. Most of the features are pretty standard I'm told. Sound quality is acceptable - it passes my usual quick tests. I'd have liked a little more padding on the headband, but that's a personal preference. It seems ok in normal use.  You can mute the microphone by pressing down on the volume button (which is handy), and that lights up a red light on the microphone tip to let you know that it's muted.  In use, it feels barely there. I use it at 'default' no extension and there's no cramp. It sits over my head comfortably, and the ear pieces fit well enough.  It seems to be an odd semi-open back design - I can hear what's happening around me, but I don't notice much leakage when I'm not wearing it.  It works well for the distances I need and pairs very quickly.  Stuff I don't like? Chroma seems pointless, unless I get a mirror over my screen like I keep threatening to, I can't really see it. Considering these are wireless, I just turn them off. There is a kind of weird rotation on the ear pieces; they turn 90 degrees one way, not the other.  The ability to check battery level without the synapse configurations application would have been nice, but I run this on windows, and use synapse for other things anyway.   I'd note these are quite literally on the edge of my budget at RRP.
I recommend the TP-LINK TL-WDN4800    This card uses PCI-E. According to your board specs, you have a slot for this. You do mention your card blocks the neighboring slot - you will need to check that though, as the PCI-E slot is next to one of the slots you'd put a video card in.   Other features include:   Dual band (it operates on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands). You should be able to connect to almost any wireless network. Compatible with wireless networks that use the B/G/N(2.4Ghz) and A/N(5GHz) protocols   The biggest down side is that it is slightly above your budget at $40 (which Google tells me is currently 35.50â‚¬).     As a side note, if you are willing to spend more, there is a new version of this card available too. It is the TP-LINK Archer T6E AC1300. The major difference is that this also supports the newer AC protocol.
Your best bet currently is probably to wait for the rumored upcoming Nexus 7 2016 revision, since you want a tablet that will stay updated and your current Nexus 7 (2013) did, in fact, get updated to Android 6 Marshmallow after all.  Edit: As it turns out you already own the 2013 revision; the second segment has been left for posterity.  Since you aren't requiring an e-paper display what you're effectively asking for is the 2013 revision of the Nexus 7.   The Nexus 7 (2013 model) supports Android 6 Marshmallow officially. Both the Wifi and 3G models come in at 290g and 299g respectively. It lists for well under $250 now, having launched at $229 for the 16GB model. It's definitely the size of a Nexus 7. The base model starts at 16GB and there is a 32GB model available.   Next requirements:   It runs stock android since it's a Nexus device. This is the only requirement it doesn't make, and frankly, if you want real water resistance you're going to need a case, and that adds weight and size to any tablet. It can also add grippy texture or a strap which is something to keep in  mind. This is a matter of opinion, but based on the size and rubberized type material of the back it sounds like many people can one hand it.   The only issue I see is that it's unclear whether the Nexus 7 (2013) will get an official OTA update for Android 7 Nougat, but there is some evidence that it might. You may also want to keep in mind that there are rumors of a new Nexus 7 releasing this year alongside the Nougat update and new Nexus phones. It might be a more compelling model and might also drop the prices of the older Nexus tablets like the 7's.  You're not going to get any closer to a stock experience than the Nexus line unless you're willing to dabble with ROMs.
This somewhat depends on the compiler, linker, and interpreter.  If you are using a framework that is optimized for a certain CPU then you most likely want to go for that CPU architecture.  At the assembly level, they both use the same instruction set and there isn't a distinct advantage. With C++, if you use something like Visual Studio, I found a site that performed benchmarks on Windows 8 - VS 2012 - Firefox compile. Here are the results: benchmarks. Although this shouldn't be a definitive stamp of success for Intel since it is somewhat dated, for other benchmarks you can find on that site, Intel does win in almost all cases with the i7 architecture. So although you don't really care about graphics, other applications you may run on your machine may have noticeable differences in performance in comparison.  EDIT: I've noticed the question has been updated. Because of your specific requirements choices, I would definitely go with Intel. Now, between the two if you are going to utilize multi-core processing, then the Intel Xeon E5-2620 v4 will be optimal.  Looking at this link: Core i7 vs Xeon you can see that in terms of multi-core processing Xeon performs better in benchmarks.  One last thing, if price is a factor at all the Core i7-5820K can be considered over the Xeon.  Just looking at a quick price check on Google between the two, the Core i7 is cheaper.
A more cost-effective, differently-powerful, and still very efficient solution might lie in the AMD AM1 platform - specifically, the ASRock AM1H-ITX. This 25W TDP platform sports quad core CPUs up to 2.2ghz and 16gb RAM, which should be enough for a family such as the one you described above as long as there isn't heavy file serving going on. As a bonus, this system can even sport better single-thread performance than the Atom CPUs you've been looking at, so that's something considering the price differential!   All told, you're looking at an outlay of under $500 for a properly-kitted AM1 system, complete with SSD boot/cache and 1tb RAID1, completely fanless. You're not getting out of there for cheaper than that with an Intel solution that's similarly performative, but if you wanted to try, the Celeron J1900 boards might be a good start.
So technically, YES, there is such a thing: The Gigabyte i-RAM (second generation).  However, its performance is limited to the SATA I spec, so you're not really going to get a whole lot of good stuff out of it. It's also incredibly rare - but sometimes they do go for cheap.  It's probably a better bet to put those guys into a computer that can use them as a RAM disk and then make that network attached storage over a gigabit ethernet line.
I don't have any experience with the two models you mentioned. But, I'd recommend the Logitech z313 2.1 system. It goes for about $50. Logitech's website has some fairly detailed specs. It does use 3.5mm so you will need an adapter. I've had mine for about 2 years and it works very well. Something to consider I guess.  You could also take a look at Logitech's Z623 2.1 system. 400W total, and it does have an RCA input (It can take 3.5mm also). Goes for $150 on Logitech's website and for about $130 on Amazon.  Hope this helps!  0-60FPS
Sony Xperia Z5 Compact is probably the best small phone at the moment.  http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_z5_compact-7535.php   The camera is 23 MP. It has 32 GB storage with an external SD Card slot for up to 256 GB. The battery life is very long. Sony don't put much of a skin on their phones.   However, it is a 4.6" screen. Is that really too big for you?
Without knowing environmental concerns, I'd suggest the following, so long as you don't need to power too many peripherals (it doesn't have the connectors for it):  picoPSU-150-XT + 102W Adapter Power Kit. You should be able to cram the whole thing into that space, leaving just the power cord coming out. The big problem here is that pretty much any solution will not mate perfectly to whatever hole is in the other half the case which would normally have gone over where the original PSU's plug is. This is problematic for any industrial PC for a variety of reasons, but perhaps you can jerry rig a seal? Without knowing the environment of operation, it's impossible to say whether an off-the shelf DC adapter such as the one featured here would be sufficient, but you chose an off the shelf motherboard/CPU solution to your problem so I'm operating on the assumption that this might be OK.  The big advantages here are that it is efficient, doesn't require active cooling, and has no moving parts.
Dell's precision mobile workstations are a pretty powerful series of laptops, albeit quite pricey. Another option could be Dell's XPS series. The nice thing about Dell's products is how much you can customize the computer to your needs (to a certain extent anyways). I've listed some specs for both below, but you should check out their website for more details. Hope this is helpful!

I highly recommend you be a little more lenient. Having said that, check out the Razer Blade. You can find that this was selected as one of the best high end laptops found here: reviews.  For just some highlights, it is very portable, 14" screen, 16 GB of RAM, a SSD of 512 GB, powerful GPU, 6th gen Quadcore tech, fairly decent keyboard layout, and a price that isn't ridiculous.  Full Tech Specs:  Display  14.0" IGZO QHD+, 16:9 Ratio, 3200x1800, with LED backlight, with capacitive multi-touch  Graphics  NVIDIAÂ® GeForceÂ® GTX 970M (6GB GDDR5 VRAM, Optimusâ„¢ Technology)   Processor  IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7â€“6700HQ Quad-Core Processor with Hyper-Threading 2.6GHz / 3.5GHz (Base/Turbo)   Chipset  Mobile IntelÂ® PCHM 100-series chipset, HM170   Memory  16GB dual-channel onboard memory (DDR4, 2133MHz)   Operating System   WindowsÂ® 10 (64-Bit)   Storage   256GB SSD (PCIe M.2)   512GB SSD (PCIe M.2)   In terms of form factor, this is about as good as it gets, otherwise you will have to sacrifice the 14" screen size for a large model. I hope this helps!
I would recommend a ThinkPad X240. You can buy them used from eBay for a very affordable price definitely under $500.   I have been using my ThinkPad X240 for nearly 2 years now and I am running Kubuntu. It works flawlessly out of the box, though I would recommend you install TLP and Powertop for better battery life.   The Haswell ultra-low voltage CPUs have great power management on the latest linux Kernel. Although there is only 1 DIMM slot, it takes up to an 8GB stick.  Also this is quite a small laptop, and the battery life is great, so it's easy to whip out quickly when you need to use it, even if you're in confined spaces.   Just searching ThinkPad X240 on eBay yields many sub-$500 offerings. Don't be afraid to get a used ThinkPad, they are built really tough, even the new Lenovo ones.
ThinkPad T460S:  CPU: i5-6200U - i7-6600U. These are Skylake ultra-low voltage CPUs, which are good for battery life.  RAM: Up to 20GB (16gb SODIMM + 4gb soldered)   I/O: Everything you wanted, and there are options for backlit keyboards.  Display: 14" up to 1440p  You said that a dealbreaker was:  Keyboards that have the Fn key outside the Ctrl key (almost all Lenovos - not sure if anyone else)   But the ThinkPad BIOS allows you to switch the CTRL and FN keys around, which is what I have done.
You might take a look at the Photive BTH3 Headphones off Amazon.com They go for just under $50. They are bluetooth, over the ear, have a built in mic and have a battery life of 12 hours (as they claim). The headphones also come with a carrying case. Hope this helps.
I ended up buying the whole LCD assembly w/ frame ($52):    Image credit https://www.phonepartworld.com/lg-nexus-5X-lcd-screen-digitizer-with-frame   It seems to be OEM; everything fit perfectly and it worked without any fiddling It was fairly easy to install; I didn't need to break out a heat gun to remove the front glass itself. The hardest part was removing the back cover, which was done fairly easily with a flathead screwdriver and a credit card.   The only problem I have now is the volume buttons are a little harder than normal, which I suspect is a mistake I made putting it back together. I'll probably tear it apart again to fix that.
I recommend the LINKSYS WUSB6100M Next-Gen AC AC600 Mu-Mimo USB Adapter. This device uses an Atheros chipset, which is quite well supported on linux. It also has pretty good performance, which is surprising given its form factor. It's probably a lot more expensive than a good internal card would be, but it is well-reviewed, well supported, and has the MIMO you need to run an AP along with a client. Mind you, I haven't ever set that up in linux so I can't tell you for sure it would work, but from a pure capabilities standpoint, it should.
This fundamentally boils down to a motherboard question - what is the cheapest motherboard that can inexpensively support at least 512Gb RAM. Finding the absolute cheapest would be difficult, but I can suggest one that will not disappoint in making your total system cost a lot less than $13,000 (disgusting, innit?). Really this is going to come down to how great your ebay skills are, because the cost is going to utterly depend on the RAM modules you can acquire -and while you can reliably buy high-capacity DDR4 in stores for relatively cheap, you can sometimes find high-capacity DDR3 for cheap enough to justify that route. I will provide solutions for both paths.   First, the DDR4 build - it depends on the Asus Z10PE-D16. Please note that the rest of the build surrounding this motherboard is only to give you an idea of total system cost and likely configuration, and may not reflect a "good" design for your particular use case (Since I have no idea what you're doing, I'm just building it as I would for a sort of general use case in the vicinity of what you appear to be trying to accomplish).

Currently there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of 1x32gb DDR3 RAM going around at acceptable prices, but if you can source that then you've pretty much got it made.  I might also note that with 512gb of RAM in play, you're almost certainly going to want ECC RAM - both of my options are ECC - and you'll also want to consider the sanity of whatever it is you're doing. Chances are there's some clever way to cache or distribute your data so that it doesn't have to ALL live in memory simultaneously on a single machine. If you can figure that problem out then you can save a bundle.
OK, so the better answer for you is the Atheros AR9287 mPCI-E card. It is:   Atheros, so well-supported in Linux Can run two modes simultaneously via MIMO mPCI-E, so it has the faster interface and the location in the laptop less likely to incur damage Costs way less   It is only B/G/N, does this matter?  One final caveat - sometimes laptop makers put in whitelists in their BIOS to prevent people from changing the mPCI-E card in their machine. You should find out if your model has such a whitelist and either circumvent it by flashing a non-proprietary BIOS or else get the USB stick option.
So, this isn't the smallest 4" phone, but I was amazed to find a phone like this, so I'm going to put it out here because I wasn't aware these kinds of phones existed - I recommend the Sonim XP7. This phone is kind of a monster. It's a little short on the internal memory at 16gb with no way to add more, so that is a concern, but... this thing has a 40h talk time. That's crazy. It's also very well reviewed for its GPS performance. The CPU and RAM match or beat the 5s. But yeah, it is a little bigger, and yeah, it doesn't really match up in terms of storage capacity. Still, you can find it on the used market for pretty darn cheap. Here's a comparison across all the considered devices.
Get the Logitech - MX Master Wireless Laser Mouse. It's got a good bluetooth-based connection technology that is dead simple to use, it has a thumb button, and it enjoys a decent DPI for twitch shooting like Overwatch. I would actually recommend not getting too crazy with the buttons for games like Overwatch, because you don't want to be accidentally setting off ultimates or things like that in hectic situations.
Toshiba Tecra Z40  I saw a link on reddit for this and although the online reviews for this aren't especially great, you notice that they have the base model. When you  go to the site you find out you can configure nearly everything!   I turned the dials up to 11 (apart from the touchscreen) to get this:   Tecra Z40 SkyLake    1,399.00 IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7-6600U Processor (vPro)   150.00 NVIDIAÂ® GeForceÂ® 930M w/ 2GB DDR3    120.00 14.0-inch diagonal widescreen FHD 1920 x 1080 display    60.00 No Touchscreen   0.00 16 GB DDR3L 1600MHz = 8 GB x 2   195.00 512 GB M.2 SATA Solid State Drive (SSD)  350.00 TPM 2.0, Fingerprint Reader, SmartCard Reader    10.00 Backlit, Spill Resistant Keyboard (keys all in the right place!) FHD Webcam with Dual Microphones USB 3.0 (3), RGB, HDMI SD Card Reader Docking Connector 4-cell 60 Wh Li-Ion Battery   Total: 2284.00 USD  So far this is the only one that meets all the specs. The customisation on the site was key.
The benefit of framerate is not lineary increasing, as your eye does not notice the difference between 60 and 120 Hz as succintly as 30 vs 60 (if at all). Please consult:    Can the Average Gamer See More than 60Hz??? NCIX Tech Tips How Many FPS Can Your Eye See? The law of diminishing returns   On the other hand, human eye has effective resolution of about 8 Mpx (please see for detais: What Is The Resolution Of The Eye?). The problem whether you see a difference is well discussed here: Can you see the difference with a 4K monitor? (brief: yes, you'll definietely see a difference, unless monitor is too small/you sit too far).  It's a question worth thinking about, but I'd go for crisp picture or would consider something in between: ex. WQHD (1440p) resolution and 120 Hz. Also, keep in mind, that color quality and even back-light are also very important factors.
I think you're definitely going to want a monitor with LED backlighting, like the Acer G257HL BMIDX. At ~125.00, who cares how long it lasts? Everything else about it meets your spec, and I have good experiences with Acer monitors in general.   I would personally not ask the GTX 960 to perform at 1440p, so there's that, too.
What you're looking for is called a Video Wall Controller. These are the boxes that you see behind the massive arrays of screens showing a single composited image in the big chain stores. They usually run around a $1000 or more. Without knowing the monitors involved I can't make a recommendation on which one to use. I know of no such products priced at private consumer levels, since usually that part of the market just uses a PC with two video outs to achieve the same thing (except, of course, that the video source has to come from the PC. You might try to rig up something with an HDMI-in capture card being passed out to two HDMI ports off a PC, but you wouldn't probably get true extended screen support - more like you'd have to span the image in a window drawn across both screens. Alas).
I almost hesitate to recommend this, because you do buy it on Amazon, but given that I've personally used this product with my raspberry pi and had great satisfaction with it, I can't resist. What youÂ reallyÂ want is the iPazzPort 3D Gyroscope Fly Air Mouse Mini Wireless Handheld Keyboard for Andriod TV&PC. Whew that's a long title, but iPazzPort is short on marketing genius and long on product functionality, fortunately. They have different models available - the more recent ones weirdly apparentlyÂ integrate SIPphone technology into the keyboard/mouse set, butÂ the model I used was just a keyboard/mouse combo smaller than a candybar that fit in my pocket quite easily. Better yet, it used a standard phone battery, which was replaceable, and the 2.4ghz wireless dongle required no driver installation on any linux or windows system I ever used it on. The mouse is a gyro air mouse kinda like what you'd find in the standard Wii controller, but it proved to be a very functional solution to the idea of a mobile mouse, because the touchpads on these little guys' cousins are just too small to be of much use.  They're not the cheapest you could find, or the prettiest, but I always liked mine and it never let me down. The compatibility was, for me, the killer feature.
First thing first, this keyboards are overall really well built, solid and reliable for a reasonnable price. However you will have a hard time founding what you are looking for in the 50-70 USD price range so the following keyboards are going to be in the 80-150 USD price range.  Now you know that, you want to choose if you need the numerous keypad on the right, you will chose Quickfire XT if you need it and Quickfire TK (both from coolermaster) if you don't. (It really come down to preferences but I think that for gaming the TK version is better and cheaper).  Now if you want backlighting you'll need to drop some more money for a TKi or a XTi, they are modable so you can download custom backlighting templates on the internet to customize the way the leds light (I don't have any link right now but I've seen keyboards moded just like you described it).  Unfortunately if the thing you're looking for really is a razer RGB like lighting you'll need to go to razer where the price is insanely high and the quality is much decieving but this is the gaming market right now.  So if you can't spend more than 100+ USD you will be forced to chose between fancy RGB and quality build :/ That's why I found coolermaster to be a good compromise between both.  EDIT: Fixed whole answer
As said before, to that price, you will not found something that satisfies all your requirements. A few month ago, I was in the same situation: looking for a RGB, mechanical, well built keyboard at a price as low as possible.  Obviously I had to make some concessions and I finally went to the Corsair Strafe. This keyboard is very well built (plastic, but good plastic) and is "only" 100â‚¬.  It's higher than your price range (like the Quickfire XT / TK) but at this price you have RED backlight that is fully customisable. It also comes with a numpad.  One more thing, becarful to the type of Cherry MX you choose (Corsair Strafe is sold in several versions in which the type of switch is different).  You'll notice that the Strafe also exists in an RGB version, at 170â‚¬.
Eizos are pretty much the rolls royce of monitors. They make the best and terribly pricey monitors for graphics professionals and their build quality and warranties kind of match that.  That said, my sensible go to brand for monitors is dell.   I'm going to suggest an IPS display (for excellent colour quality) and factory caliberation (which means the panel ought to be consistent, and of good quality. 1440p seems to be a happy medium. I'd go with the Dell U2515H in this case.  Dell's got excellent build quality as far as their P series monitors go, and like my p2715q, its factory caliberated (which includes checks for consistant brightness, colour quality and so on). It also has an excellent built in stand allowing for a full range of motion (which is awesome!) on vertical height and rotation, as well as some tilt.   Its the 'closest' option to your eizo I can think of, and I've generally had great experiences with their monitors
Looking through the wirecutter's picks for best 27 inch monitor, they've suggested the p2715H.  I'm a firm beliver in higher pixel density for working on text and graphics, but size has a quality on its own. 27 inches to me is 'ideal' for working on a single screen at my typical working distances (I use dual screens, but context switch, or move back a little).  The rest of the features of the 2415H is true here - factory colour caliberation and consistancy checks, and the same very flexible. Its got thin bezels and its a good, solid workhorse monitor if you have the deskspace. I'd note many people, including Jeff Atwood use one or more 27" monitors.  I'd consider the P2715Q a step up - when Ihad a 660, I was gaming at 1440p and doing many other things at 4k. Its worth a look as well.
Two years ago now, I bought the Lenovo Y510p for 700â‚¬. You can find it at a lower price for now (in addition, I bought the version with a second GPU, which was a bit more expensive, instead of the optical drive).  I'm recommending this laptop because:   Its in your price range It has a I7 4702MQ 8GB of ram which might be useful for Adobe products Has a FHD screen which had (at the time) good review about its contrast, colorimetry etc. wich is, I think, a good point for your usage. In addition to the Intel's IGB, you have a GT755m wich is useful for media works (at least for video editing).   I know Lenovo released its successor but it has a terrible screen (according to the tests I read 2 years ago).
OK, I recommend the ASRock J3710-ITX Mini ITX Pentium J3710 Motherboard. This motherboard features an integrated quad core CPU that might provide the performance you're looking for - it's very difficult to say because you haven't given us a whole lot of information about the programs/dev environments you're using, but anyway it's significantly faster than your current CPU. Outfit this with at least 8gb RAM and a good SSD if you'll be caching any of that A/V data to disk.
Well, I'll tell you how I'd solve this problem. Not sure you're going to like it, but it does technically do everything you ask, so long as you have the right setup:  *What follows is mostly a software-based solution, with just a little necessary hardware. If that's off-topic for this site, I understand.*   You buy a Raspberry Pi and install it on your LAN. On the Pi, you install some version of linux and configure it to support tunneling RDP over an SSH connection to another port in your network (this port will be open on your target machine). You also configure your network to support WOL from the Pi. If you like, you also configure it to serve as a PXE Boot Server, though you'll probably want to add a USB external drive to the Pi for that. If your target machine doesn't support PXE boot, you'll need to install a NIC that does. On your target machine, you install GRUB. On your target machine, you install whatever OSes you want, but it should have at least one on it. You boot into whatever OS is first in the boot list of GRUB. You reboot to the preinstalled OS of your choice using grub-reboot. This can probably be done from at least Windows 10, but should also be possible through more arcane means on older Windows OSes.   Some further tweaks: You can use PXE boot to boot to GRUB, which means you can keep the GRUB configuration on your remote access computer (the raspberry pi), modify its boot order there, and then push that via PXE boot to the target machine.   WOL comes in handy in situations where the target machine is turned off. So long as it has been properly configured in the BIOS, you can turn it on from the remote machine. From there, either preinstalled OSes or your PXE boot configuration can take over.
Go with the GTX 1000 series... I have a GTX 1060 paired with a r7 370 in my rig. I use the GTX 1060 for working (mostly for cuda in blender and adobe premiere) and I use the r7 370 for running my screens. The GTX 1060 goes for about $270 on Amazon. Alternatvely, you could get the founder's edition for about $300 from nVidia's website. I personally have the founder's edition. I'm very happy with the GTX 1060 and it has worked excellently so far. It does support physX.
My advice will be the opposite of 0-60FPS's advice. Do not get an Nvidia card. If anything, develop using a high-end Intel chip like the HD 4600 or better - this will be closest to some of your market. It's also currently in your system in the form of your CPU's onboard graphics and can be enabled via BIOS if it isn't already.  However, you have asked for a GPU, so I'll recommend the AMD RX 460. AMD currently has an architecture more advanced for the new DX12 and Vulkan stuff - it takes better advantage of these new technologies than Nvidia's 1xxx lineup. It's also cheaper. Keep your GTX 650 if you ever want to use PhysX - you can dedicate the card to PhysX in the Nvidia control panel, leaving the rest of the game rendering job to your AMD card. The R7 460 will represent a decent step up from the GTX 650 as well.  Both cards can be used at once in Blender and GIMP as well, so that's nice (though since OpenCL alone is supported on GIMP and AMD traditionally outperforms Nvidia in OpenCL applications, the Nvidia card might not offer much help in GIMP). Also, with an AMD card in your system alongside your Intel and Nvidia cards, you'll have the trifecta - a good example of each major graphics player's architectures. Comparing in-game performance will be as simple as switching which one you use as your display output when you start your computer up.   It will be interesting to see if my recommendation changes with the release of any 1050s or whatever, but I don't think so, since you'd lose out on that trifecta of compatibility testing.
Your motherboard was sold with several different chipsets on it; the best possible answer will depend on what chipset you have available.   Without knowing more than you have already said, the best certain upgrade would be the Pentium 4 RK80532PC064512. That's already probably the CPU you have, BUT you can do a bsel mod on it if your chipset supports an FSB frequency of 533mhz. In that case the bsel mod bringing it from 400mhz to 533mhz, if stable, would would make your CPU run at 3,4645mhz, or roughly 3.5ghz.   The fastest non-modded CPU available for any chipset you have would be the Pentium 4 RK80532PE083512, which runs at 3.067ghz and has HT technology, enabling to be roughly twice as fast as any other CPU of the same architecture and clock speed when running multithreaded programs which do not max out any single thread. Your PC must support a FSB frequency of 533mhz to run this processor.   Interestingly, there are a few processors listed for your board which have 800mhz FSB support. These are not of great interest to you in and of themselves, as they all sport lower clockspeeds than the CPUs discussed above, but they do indicate that if you had a board that supported an FSB of 800mhz, there's probably a Bsel mod you could try which would push your current CPU to the insane heights of ~5.2ghz - I almost guarantee it would not be stable, however.    On a side note, your PC is woefully outdated and is currently outperformed by almost all smartphones. New computers which are incredibly more powerful than that machine can be had for less than $50. It is probably time to upgrade.
Although my personal preference is to remove the DVD drive, replace it with a caddy, and drop an SSD into that caddy (possibly with caching involved), a simpler, somewhat slower option that allows you to retain your DVD drive is to replace your HDD with an SHDD. I recommend the Seagate - 1TB Internal Serial ATA III/Serial ATA II Solid State Hybrid Drive for Laptops. This drive has 1Tb of slow storage, backed up with 8Gb of MLC flash, which it uses to automagically cache the rest of the drive according to how you use it. Think of the performance as being somewhere between your standard HDD and SSDs.
You can not use ARM processor in a conventional way. That's because they need explicit set of instruction, which are specific to their architecture. "Normal" operating systems like most Distros of Linux/Unix and windows do not work with this kind of systems.  ARM processor are always soldered to the motherboard (don't quote me on that). So the best thing to have is a Raspberry Pi (or similar) with a external drive (I think Seagate has a HDD specific for the RPi with 314 GB of space).  EDIT : After OP's comments.  @jellyfish man   This motherboard uses an ARM cpu. It's a server board with it's own operating system. And as you mey think, it has no consumer friendly characteristics.  EDIT : After Adam Wykes comments.  ARM cpu's are soldered because     It's mostly because ARM is supposed to be cheap and upgradable sockets add to cost. AMD and Intel also do soldered chips when it makes sense to, such as in netbooks and tablets.   According to Adam Wykes     Also, most major distros of linux - red hat, Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, Gentoo, etc - can be run on ARM systems.   Comment on the last statement. You can see here that even though it exists, they are different operating systems. What I meant is that you cannot use a x86/x64 operating systems on ARM based systems.
If you are interested in modern stuff, you won't have a problem. Scaling issues only occur with dated software. So, as long as you aren't trying to run Battlefield 1942 you should be able to enjoy your UHD display. Media content has also been getting better suited for 4k, so it is definitely not to early to make the upgrade.
It's actually totally possible. AMD was supposed to release dev boards based on their new Opteron A1100 octocore ARM APU, but as you can see, there have been severe difficulties with actually getting anyone to ship the darn things.  Another tantalizing possibility is the MP30-AR0 Server Board by Gigabyte. Again, finding anyone willing to ship this stupid thing is the hard part, but it does exist.  Considering Windows 10 works on ARM, Android works on ARM, ChromeOS works on ARM, Linux works on ARM, and some form of Mac's OS works on ARM... I'll leave you to guess why these boards aren't easily available to lowly consumers in an era when CPU power is increasingly irrelevant for most users.
Cooler Master recently released a new keyboard/mouse combo called the Masterkeys L Lite RGB Combo. One of the RGB modes is a wave pattern. You can get it on Amazon for about $75 dollars.
If you can find it in Europe, get the ASUS Laptop VivoBook E403SA-US21.  This laptop is fanless. On top of that, it uses a solid-state drive instead of a typical spinner, so you won't even get access sounds out of this thing. Literally the only noise coming from this machine would be what you ask it to put through its speakers.   Does it perform? In my estimation, yes. Its quad core Pentium N3700, while comparatively weak, should be quite sufficient for all of your needs. 4gb is a bit on the low end these days, and apparently this cannot be upgraded, but since Linux isn't that much of a memory hog to begin with, I'm not too concerned. Even in the event of needing to use swap off the drive, it's a fast drive, so it wouldn't be the absolutely horrendous swap/page file thrashing of yesteryear. Intel HD graphics are well-supported under linux and should provide you with the graphical power to watch movies on the 1080p screen without a hiccup.  There are lots of little perks to like about this design as well. Because of the low-power CPU and storage solution, Asus reports you could expect up to 14 hours of battery life, which is really quite exceptional. It is also very lightweight and does have a USB-C port, which will probably be important later on for connectivity purposes.  I think it's the right machine for you. That said, this is not an uncommon design, so if you can find cheaper models with a similar design spec, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend those either.
I know this is a bit late, but I did just find that Alcatel Fierce 4 has a phone for metro PCS and will release one for T-Mobile this fall. It is $69 USD. It will come with marshmallow.
If you're just running one VM, then the i7-6700K will be just fine for you. While it only has four cores, those cores have hyperthreading, which means that as far as your OS and the VM are concerned, your computer would have eight cores. This actually does improve performance. I'm not going to get into the black magic that makes it all work, but for your purposes the Intel Core i7-6700K will work fine.  For that matter, you can really step it down to something as low as an FX-8350 and not get noticeable performance differences in most games or VM situations, but I would not recommend doing so unless you were on a strict budget.
Product  This seems to be what you are looking for.  It is pure sine wave output, a modest price of $140, 1000 VA, and it is highly rated. It can't be internationally shipped from US Amazon, but this matches your criteria.
I chatted with rep from four-faith.com and they said I can buy from them. At worst I can enter into another chat to make the purchase happen. The model http://en.four-faith.com/f3a36h-mediawifioperating-marketingrouter.html seems best for my needs:   9 to 36 Volts DC 128GB SSD installed 3G / 4G IEEE 802.11b/g/n      Update:  Price - US$506 shipped.  If I was going to be travelling often then I wouldn't mind paying this.  For 2 or 3 times a year it is a bit too much.    Update:  They also have a model with 32G TF card instead of 128Gb SSD.  It is US$370 shipped.
I don't think your best solution lies in a single router. My solution is to have you buy a standard car DC to AC inverter if your car doesn't have one built in, then plug a standard retail wireless router with USB filehosting into that, and then configure your router to use its wifi to get the external connection - use OpenWRT on it if necessary - a 4G hotpot modem or one of your 4G-connected phones in tethering mode. I do this in my van and it is the cheapest way I've found to do it.
Find out what form factor the original PSU is, then buy a PSU Adapter Plate which will adapt whatever that form factor is to standard ATX. Then attach that plate to your new PSU, and then bolt the other form factor edge to the darker gray object (object [1] in your nomenclature). Should work, though you might have to get creative with fasteners (you might need flat head bolts).
One solution with which I am familiar is to buy an older thin client such as the HP t5740e WES.  This machine is low-power and fairly cheap, but it has your RS-232 and ethernet as required. It also has some other neat perks, like 4gb of internal flash storage (not as fast as a conventional SSD for sustained reads/writes, but should make for a good swap partition or even OS partition, since it is low-power and has good seek times).    The biggest downside here is that it runs on the Atom N280 chip, which is a very low performance single core x86 processor with hyperthreading. A headless or openbox/i3/LXDE-based linux would be the best match for its capabilities, and don't ask it to do to much in the way of running a program. I've run old dosbox games on it just fine, but that's about the limit.
Another possible solution, if you need even less processing power and more cost savings, might be the ALIX.3D2. This is a dev board which supports linux and runs an AMD Geode x86 processor at 500mhz - very low power, very low performance, but also very small and rather inexpensive - though you'll have to source the enclosure and power supply as well, of course.
This one's pretty easy, really. Pick up the TP-Link HS100 Wi-Fi Smart Plug. It was the first device I found when I searched for "smart outlet."   It is $25 It is bog standard 2.4ghz wifi It turns stuff on and off It is still made and supported by TP-Link, which is a large and well-known networking products manufacturer It's easy to use - "there's an app for that" as it were.
Mini-Box OpenUPS does the job but is much too expensive at $150 (Amazon Germany - $120 directly from the manufacturer). I won't accept this answer because I think something much cheaper should exist.  It does everything asked for in the question, plus balancing up to 6S and some other battery chemistries too and output is not just in the right range, but even configurable in a larger range.

For your CPU a 4GB GTX 970 would be a good matchup. It would also be a huge upgrade from your current card. It is also way under your budget at around $300, but nothing better than that would really be worth the price for you due to a CPU bottlenck.  GTX 970 4GB OC Edition - https://m.newegg.com/Product/index?itemnumber=N82E16814125840  Your mobo's PCIe 2.0 might be a little bit of a problem but you really dont haveto worry about it, since AM3+ doesn't supprt 3.0 anyways...
There is very important question about buying new GPU to your setup:   Will you upgrade your PC (CPU,MOBO,RAM) in the nearest future ?   Answer is to your actual setup but if you will edit your question saying us that you will upgrade your PC in nearest future I will improve my answer.  GTX 1060 with 3GB VRAM  There is no other option for your CPU. AMD cards are more CPU hungry than nVidia cards so we choose nVidia. There is no sense in investing in other generation cards (GTX 9xx) so you should buy this card or wait for GTX 1050 which should be even better pair for your CPU. Any other (better cards like GTX 1070 or GTX 1080) will be bottlenecked by your CPU.  Recommended models:   ASUS GeForce GTX 1060 3GB - $220 on newegg.com GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1060 Windforce OC 3GB - $210 on newegg.com   Alternative solution:  Look for second hand GTX960 2GB VRAM it should cost ~$100-$120 it is card which for sure won't be bottlenecked by your CPU and will be cheaper than GTX 1060.
If you are willing to do a bit more work on integration with whatever you want to run, you can try a Parallella board. That gives you a 16 core RISC co processor plus a dual core main processor on a board the size of a credit card.  They use very little energy and are specifically designed to be used in clusters or in parallel (hence the name) applications.  As a bonus, they start at about $100 each and they run Linux. https://www.parallella.org/
I've been using the Kinesis Freestyle 2 for Mac for several years now. I had the original Freestyle, but wore it out!  The Freestyle is unique in that it is a split keyboard with the two halves connected with a cable. It is USB (which I prefer) and has native Mac keys and no number pad. I also like the black color which doesn't show dirt. It's a quiet keyboard with a fairly soft touch.
I'm going to argue that the Dell Latitude E6430 Laptop as refurbished by Newegg represents the perfect solution to your problem.  First and foremost, this machine meets all of your hardware requirements - it has HDMI and VGA outs, and it has the graphical horsepower and resolution to cleanly and clearly display these presentations on both screens simultaneously.   The real bonus here is that it comes with Windows 7 Professional, which is is a very special OS for your purposes. Unlike earlier and later versions of Windows, Windows 7 Pro can freely install the Windows XP Mode, which is functionally a VM of Windows XP. With this VM set up and duplicated as many times as you need, you can mirror your display to the projector and have their presentation run in a full-screen VM window, which can be configured to prevent them from accessing any of the hardware ports or networking ports. It is possible to set it up so that only technical users would know how to get out of the virtual machine's window. It's also a fairly cheap and powerful solution, so that's nice.
I just came across a great hybrid (depending on the exact use case): The Automatic Pro plugs into a vehicles OBD-II port, transmits location updates every 20 seconds when the vehicle is in motion, and draws its power from the car.  Yes, it's an "active" tracker, but the $130 purchase price includes "at least" 5 years of 3G data service.  So it's not exactly what was specified: It's somewhat traceable, it requires access to the inside of the vehicle to place, and it would be readily noticed by anybody checking the vehicle's OBD port ... unless connected and concealed off a splitter cable.  But on the plus side it offers real-time tracking, IFTTT, and other integration and safety features.
You have not specified a budget or a technology preference (OpenCL vs CUDA), so I will attempt to run the gamut, with one important inclusion that you did not mention but which I see as fairly important for your purposes: USB C/Thunderbolt 3.   If you're running a budget and you need something that's going to make the most of a program stack utilizing OpenCL, I recommend something like the Acer Laptop Aspire E5-553G-1986. This AMD Crossfire machine features the company's most powerful processor currently shipped in the mobile market, coupled with (at LAST) high-speed DDR4 RAM in a dual channel configuration, upgradable to 16gb. It features the dedicated AMD Radeon R8 M445DX GPU combined with the powerful graphics chip on the APU itself, which should provide quite a bit of AMD's noted OpenCL GP-GPU capability.  On the other side of things, in the high-end range, Intel and Nvidia dominate in professional solutions such as the Dell Precision 15 5000 M5510. Intel's full-power mobile i7 CPU couples with Nvidia's professional Quadro M1000M GPU to deliver what is no doubt one of the more powerful and reliable solutions available on the market. If your program is CUDA-bound, then this is more like the machine you want. If CPU processing power is the main drag, then this too will be your best bet; Intel's i7-6700QM is pretty much unrivaled in the mobile space. This machine is also extremely light - unusual for Dell's robust professional line.  I'd like to end by touching on the inclusion of Thunderbolt 3/USB C in both of these laptops. Whatever you do, the time may come when you just don't have enough GP-GPU compute resources available to you - or perhaps you end up needing a solution from the company that doesn't feature a GPU in your laptop. In those cases, you can use this new connection type to add external GPUs to your laptop in order to greatly improve your image processing capability.
You seem to have a misconception regarding what is a "better" processor.  The i3/i5/i7 structuring is not such that all i7 chips will be better than any i5 or i3 chip, they are generalized and should only give you an idea of its general level of power and efficiency for average users. Most especially, it is not so easy to compare processors between generations (an i7 2700k and an i7 6770k are two horribly different beasts but they fill the same performance i7 shelf slot)  A third-generation i5 2500k will be much more powerful for computationally heavy tasks than the seventh-generation i7 6250, for example. This is because the 2500k is a four-core, overclockable chip designed for good single-threaded performance and was not designed with extremely low power consumption as the 6250 was. The 6250 is also a dual-core mobile optimized processor.  The fact that your CPU has an integrated GPU is irrelevant. You'd do yourself a disservice to specifically seek a CPU without an integrated GPU by drastically reducing the number of options that meet your criteria, let alone leaving you high and dry without video output should your GPU fail for any reason.  Long story short, if performance is what you are looking for you should just buy the i5 or i7 CPU that is at the top of your budget. If you have priorities other than maximum performance, you should seek advice from communities that seek the same goal (power efficiency, specific benchmarks, overclocking, etc). The CPU will have a GPU included. This is not a bad thing.  As a specific recommendation, the 1155 socket accepts Ivy Bridge CPUs (these start with a "3"). Assuming you seek performance, either the i7 3770k, or the lower budget i5 3570k are the options with the best price/performance. If your motherboard does not allow for overclocking you will not see a difference between these CPUs and the less expensive non-K variants (i5 3570, i7 3770).  Please keep in mind that upgrading your processor could very easily not change a single perceptible thing about your computer. You need to determine what your bottleneck actually is - for most people it is more often the amount of RAM installed.  Edit: From looking at your comments throughout this question, it is my personal opinion that you are not exactly sure where your priorities are. Specifically seeking a Xeon because it doesn't include a GPU without understanding what the Xeon was designed for doesn't make sense.   Being fair, you haven't explained what the machine is supposed to do. Are you doing heavy scientific computation on this machine? Are you running a server? We can only guess you're gaming on it because you have a GTX 1060 and that's a great budget gaming card. For gaming there is absolutely zero reason to purchase a Xeon over a similarly priced Core i-series processor and doing so may actually be detrimental to performance or your wallet.
ECS H61H2-M12 1.0 Enclosure Type: Desktop      The motherboard sucks I know. But well, what's the best CPU I can plug   there. I can't easily upgrade my motherboard.   No you got it all wrong, your attitude isâ€¦ wellâ€¦  Anyways, when I put "ECS H61H2-M12 1.0" into my favorite Internet search engine I get results like this stating that the motherboard has an LGA1155 socket and an H61 chipsetÂ¹, hence H61 in the name.  "Skylake is not an option" because of your limited knowledge about technology and interpretation (mis-)lead by made up and ever changing marketing terms, but instead it's the complete wrong socket! You are stuck with SandyBridge or IvyBridge.   What's the actual name of your i5 CPU? Not all of them are quad cores on the desktop, I found the 3470T which is a dual core with 4 threads. Does it make sense to upgrade from one CPU with the same amount of cores within the same generation? Generally not if you're looking for 50 to 100% and beyond performance increases. You'd rather trade the GPU part on the CPU for more cores? That's unlikely on a board designed for APUs with a matching socket. There are enthusiast and server platforms with different sockets (required for more PCIe lanes, wiring to connect more RAM modules, etc.) though, that don't include GPUs on the CPU package.   The top processor you can get for the LGA1155 socket is the  2700K with 95W or 3770K with 77W TDP (more TDP doesn't have to imply it's better or vice versa). Why do I mention TDP? When you say you can't change the motherboard for some reasons I wonder if the enclosure was designed to accommodate beefier graphics cards and CPUs. You forgot other important things in your question so you may not have considered TDP limitations.     Launched with Sandy Bridge, your processor might be a Sandy Bridge CPU.
I'm going to make the assumption that you will be gaming, because you have a GTX 1060 and that is generally what people with that GPU want to do. If that is true, then it is probably the case that a new CPU would help you out. However, I am going to depart from the standard recommendation of "get another i5 that's faster" because your chipset can't overclock it (which is where much of the value of the i5 line lies for gamers), and in any case newer games are taking advantage of more than 4 cores now. For that reason, I recommend you get the Intel Xeon E3-1290 v2 CPU. This CPU is the most powerful CPU you can put on your socket, with a stock speed of 3.7ghz and a turbo boost up to 4.1ghz.
You need the i3-5005U. Its graphics power is the main reason. If/when you are consuming GPU-accelerated web content or converting videos, the extra GPU horsepower will make all the difference and is worth the extra cost alone. Additionally, the i3 has a little extra cache, which might come in especially handy for virtualization.
This Intel DH77SL-50K ought to do it. Does everything you ask for and costs $50 on Ebay. Work for you?
This is a complicated question to answer, because while you are ostensibly looking for a mechanical keyboard, you are comparing them unfavorably with a non-mechanical keyboard whose best characteristics for you are essentially incompatible with the concept of a mechanical keyboard.  That being said, yes, there are mechanical keyboards with built in palm rests. They aren't slim, and they don't have shallow key depth - for that you'd want something with scissor-switches, like the SIIG JK-US0412-S1 USB Slim Aluminum Keyboard with Hub.  The Mechanical keyboard with integrated rest I recommend for you is the ROCCAT Ryos TKL Pro USB Illuminated Mechanical Gaming Keyboard. There are cheaper Chinese keyboards with "mechanical" switches and palm rests, but they look about as attractive as their QA process probably was, so the Ryos lineup it is. Of that lineup, I think Cherry MX Black switch-based models are your best bet; their 60g linear actuation force is near the 65g linear actuation of the Apple Aluminum you've been using. Keep in mind that with Cherry switches, few to none of them actually require you to travel all the way to the bottom of the switch in order to actuate; most actuate somewhere about halfway down, so you don't have to slam the keys or travel the complete distance to type the character.
I ended up buying Core i7 3770  I think people should see this  https://www.cpubenchmark.net/socketType.html  Basically I just check the benchmark number and see the price  Intel Xeon E3-1290 V2 @ 3.70GHz 9,925 $885.00* Intel Xeon E3-1280 V2 @ 3.60GHz 9,757 $644.99* Intel Core i7-3770K @ 3.50GHz 9,560 $560.50 Intel Xeon E3-1270 V2 @ 3.50GHz 9,462 $421.00 Intel Core i7-3770 @ 3.40GHz 9,328 $335.55 Intel Xeon E3-1275 V2 @ 3.50GHz 9,320 $434.00   Based on that I think Intel Core i7-3770 @ 3.40GHz is the best choice.  Basically the top 6 core have the same socket type and almost the same benchmark result. However, Intel Core i7 3770 is simply cheaper. It's only $335. I actually got a used one for $200 from tokopedia.com  Xeon 1290 is simply too expensive and not available on tokopedia.com  I didn't mention budget range and I actually do expect to spend $1k. However, because i7 seems to have far cheaper cost benefit ratio I simply pick i7-3770.  However, Adam told Intel Xeon E3-1290 V2 but the price is too expensive
I suggest looking at ratings for some of the better bluetooth portable speakers that are available for people these days. One that particularly stood out to me was the Marshall Kilburn, which attracts me for its bass/treble knobs, (apparently) excellent sound quality (I'm by no means an audiophile and I haven't heard this one in person, but if I had $250 to blow on a soundsystem I'd feel pretty good about this one given its brand and reviews), and the carrying strap.   Two caveats: first, your aunt's laptop helps determine sound quality - it has to have a sound card in it that is worthy of the speakers they connect to. I would test this by connecting the laptop to a large, known-good home sound system and pumping your music through that - if it still sounds good then you don't need to worry about the sound card in the laptop. If not, then perhaps you will need to consider upgrading the laptop or getting an external USB soundcard, which starts to become rather clunky if you're on the move.  The second caveat is that your aunt's laptop will need bluetooth to use this speaker. If you don't have one, you can add bluetooth via USB dongles that run only a few bucks.
I am currently running an Oryx Pro from System76 and it is serving me very well, I've configured it with:   24GB of DDR4 A 250GB NVMe SSD (+ a 1TB hdd) A GTX 970M Graphics Card And an i7-6700HQ processor. (Everything working with 16.04 LTS)   Although this meets all your requirements, I spent $2000 on mine, you're probably going to configure it differently. (Now with GTX 10xx cards too!)  They come with Ubuntu installed by default, and I have absolutely loved my Oryx so far, hope you get an equally great experience if you choose to buy one. I have had zero issues with graphics drivers or video/x-server configuration. It just works as it should.
Another vote for the i7-4790K: I tried to make an i7-6700K machine to outperform it.  Both CPUs were delidded â€” (CL Liquid Pro put between die & IHS) â€” and overclocked as far as I could reliably go with Noctua NH-D14 & Vcore=1.275).  I got to 4.5/4.4/4.4/4.4GHz (1/2/3/4 cores active) on the 6700, and used DDR4 3000 (CL15).  With the 4790K, I was able to get 4.9/4.8/4.7/4.7GHz, and used DDR3 2400 (CL10).  In both single-thread and overall (Passmark) CPU benchmarks, the 4790 bested the 6700, not by a ton, but...
I'll recommend a close relative to the monitor I use: the AOC Vesa I2269VWM 21.5".   21.5" is pretty close to your 22" requirement. There are also 23" and 27" options, though I imagine you'd rather not go for those. 1920x1080 full HD No USB ports. If you want USB ports on your desk rather than having to dig for the PC I/O plate every time, I recommend you get a USB hub rather than looking for a monitor with integrated USB ports - the majority of monitors will come without them, and having them will make a monitor more expensive. 2 (i.e. stereo) loudspeakers AOC do sell in Europe; I haven't confirmed that this model is available in Europe, but it's certainly available in the UK. Â£104.16 / 121,58â‚¬ (based on UK price and current exchange rates; EUR figure subject to change)   AOC are generally pretty reliable; my AOC has been going for a year so far, and the AOC monitors my workplace uses have been going for 8-ish years.
Alternatively, you could have the Dell UltraSharp U2212HM 21.5" monitor. Very similar to your current monitor, but in 21.5" size.   21.5" 1920x1080 Full HD 4 USB ports HDMI Available, like most/all Dell monitors, in Europe I'm finding prices between 135â‚¬ and 160â‚¬; prices will vary depending on which retailer you pick.   As you've probably already worked out, Dell are one of the best for monitors. This is a pretty solid bet - I've not used one myself, but I know a couple of people who use either this monitor or a close relative and have been very satisfied with it.
While the solution I would go with would be headphones, and a good dac, there's actually better speakers that do USB and other options.  Looking at reviews (the wirecutter does excellent ones with a panel of experts, the audio engine A2+ sounds like a good option to consider, no pun intended.  Its tiny but comes with a good range of inputs (including a built in DAC so you can bypass the inputs on the laptop). Its powered by a switching power supply so you can use it anywhere. Wirecutter feels its quiet, and not that bassy but this is a tradeoff for sound. If you must, consider pairing this up with a good small DAC - say a ODAC2 or a schitt modi, and its probably as good as you get with speakers and a setup that would fit in something like a laptop bag
You actually have an dedicated graphic card as well as an integrated. You have an AMD A series processor which has an iGPU, you should definitely chech if your cards arde compatible and if they support CrossFireX in order to get the most out of your system. As far as your RAM is ckncerned, yes you should definitely upgrade your memory to at least 8GB since you have a 64-bit processor in order for your pc to handle multitasking smoother... Your dedicated graphics card is pretty outdated as well, in fact i think your integrated may offer better oerformance (I haven't done any reserach on that it's just a feeling, you should check out if that's the case though, and if you can't run them in CrossFire, at least make sure you are using whichever one is better).
Probably not, external graphic cards do not run via anything lower than USB 3.0.  In addition that USB port has to be a thunderbolt port in order for an exteranl GPU to be supproted through it. This is simply because an older USB port doesn't have enough bandwidth to support the communication between a GPU and your PC, and also because it doesn't connect to the appropriate port on the motherboard. Thunderbolt ports however are based on PCI-E technology which is the same, as the one used by desktop graphics cards to communicate with the computer. Hence, if your laptop supports thunderbolt you would be able to purchase an external GPU chassis (like the one offered by RazerBlade), as well as a GPU that would convert PCI-E to thinderbolt, and plug into the proper port on your laptop. We would have to know the exact model number of your laptop to tell if it is equipped by a thunderbolt port.
Unfortunately there are precious few GPUs that can actually do anything past 2 monitors without needing to use DisplayPort or Active Adapters/Splitters of some exotic description or other, and the cards that do this are somewhat rare and often expensive when you can find them. One card that I have routinely found to be relatively cheap (and still able to handle 3 FHD screens) is the Sapphire 100322FLEX Radeon HD 6450 Graphic Card 1GB Fanless card. This has Sapphire's proprietary third RAMDAC added (they call this FleX technology), which allows all three graphic outs to be utilized simultaneously. While it is true that it doesn't come with a VGA port per se, this is easily overcome by adding the included DVI-VGA adapter to the DVI-D port (the one with the four extra holes along the cross insert).  The other option (and often a better one for many individuals) is to use a GPU to drive some of your displays, but keep your motherboard/CPU graphics chip enabled so that you can use some of those video outs (and associated spare RAMDACs) to drive your third (and fourth) screen(s).
The Pentium G4400 should do. Decent performance for general business needs, low power consumption, $45 under your budget, plus it uses the new skylake architecture. The G4400 may not be a beast, but it would get the job done.   Typically what I would do is ask the person I'm building the pc for what their habits and routines are when using their pc. Then you can look at the programs they use and determine how much each program would consume the CPU.   https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015VPX05A/ref=asc_df_B015VPX05A4524847/?tag=hawk-future-20&creative=394997&creativeASIN=B015VPX05A&linkCode=df0&ascsubtag=hawk-348218449-20
Get the cheapest one of those you can that has the smallest screen. They're all going to have about the same battery life otherwise, and they all have enough RAM for the tasks that will be thrown on them if your host OS is a linux distribution.   The more expensive options are not worth the cost.
I suggest the AMD A8-7600 for maximum lifespan. I've built a few systems with this APU by now, so I can be fairly confident in recommending it. It offers a good mix of single core, multicore, and GPU performance with a TDP of 65W, and it offers low overall system cost because mATX boards for this APU are inexpensive. It costs only about ~70, but it offers four cores at 3.1ghz stock (turbo up to 3.8ghz, which it can hit quite easily and often on its stock cooler in a decently cool system), and its R7 integrated GPU is frankly much more powerful than is likely needed - it should be able to handle screens up to 4K without difficulty (provided you get a motherboard with a video out that supports those resolutions - link is to one of the motherboards I've used for this socket that I got a world record overclock on and which I think is just about the best board for this socket).
I just want to know if the XPS 15 9550 Touch is a good laptop, given my requirements, and if not, which one would be a valid alternative.     This should be able to handle most things. The CPU is new enough to not be a bottleneck while compiling code, while the GPU is solid enough to push AAA titles to max/ultra settings in 1080p (some games might have to throttle to 30fps).  Here is a point by point break down.     This model comes in 15.6 and 17.3 inch models.   This is name brand laptop, using a brand new CPU and GPU, it will last         as long as it meets your needs. If upgrading is a concern, consider a desktop.   The 15.6 inch model is 4.85 lbs.   This laptop has a 6th Generation IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7 processor, its one of the most powerful consumer grade CPU on the market today.   The GPU will be able to play most games on Max/Ultra settings on 1080p. If there are any specific games you would like to know about google "NVIDIAÂ® GeForceÂ® GTX 965M" and the game you're interested in.     Oh and by the way, the HDD to SSD jump is amazing. I went from an old 5400rpm boot drive to a m.2 ssd drive and it is like night and day.
I can definitely say that a Lenovo is a great laptop for work from my own personal experience. I had a Lenovo and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Because businesses tend to buy new laptops only so often I would get a rather powerful one to start. The one I recommend is this: Lenovo p70. This laptop is very nice for productivity. Although it feels weird spending a lot on a laptop for your job, don't feel bad.  Your work understands that you require a nice laptop to be productive.  And definitely customize it to your needs if you can. It can dock on a laptop dock (sold separately of course). But you can also add a SSD. The dock can also be bought from Lenovo so everything is integrated perfectly. Hope this helps!
Not exactly a drone but more or less accomplishes most of the same thing. This thing is pretty awesome:     Site: http://global.varram.com/    Update: This product has horrendous support and the software is severely lacking with no plans of improvement for necessary things like LAN discovery.
This seems to meet your needs, found on newegg.  If you look at the picture, it looks like it takes 1 power connection and 2 sata cables. Its from newegg, so I'm assuming they ship to russia, but if they don't I found about 2 dozen sellers of this product on google. I hope this fits the bill, let me know if I need to change my google searches to find something else.
I found the EnGenius ENS202 N300 on Newegg.  This is a brand of wireless equipment this is designed for outdoor use. It rated up to 158 degrees. It's also water resistant with an IP55 rating, meanint its resistant to dust and low pressure water from all angles.    If this model doesn't cut it for you, this company makes a wide range of outdoor rated networking tools.    Also, another note. That tin wall is going to radiate heat like an oven. I would consider mounting a wooden block between the wall and the AP to act as a heat sink, it will absorb the heat from the metal wall, and reduce the risk of hitting the 158 degree threshold. edit I mention this because my minds eye had the access point on the outside wall of the garage, odd assumption to make...
There's not much in the way of powerful single-slot graphics cards out there -- I could find a GTX 750 Ti, but that's a mid-range card, and getting somewhat old.  Going the other direction to avoid running in to your SATA cables, Gigabyte makes short two-slot GTX 1070 and GTX 1060 cards: the card is just barely longer than the PCIe connector.  You may need to move one of your SATA cables from port 3 to port 6, but everything should still work.  And if you're willing to go to extreme effort to get extreme performance, Zotac makes a GTX 1080 with a low-profile integrated waterblock.  You'll need to set up a watercooling system to go with it, though.
I recommend the Asus Turbo GTX-1070 8gb. It's the cheapest Asus/MSI 1070 out there, and its blower cooling might actually be of some benefit to you unless you have more fans in your case than the default number it came with.  It is a very long card, but it will fit in your case and one of the two 6/8 PSU cables you have will power it. Furthermore, while it will "cover" 2 of your SATA ports, 4 will be wide open, which is the requirement. I put scare quotes around "cover" because in my experience those ports are still definitely usable, you just have to put the cables in before the card. Sometimes you might need to use right-angle SATA cables, but those aren't hard to come by; at least one probably shipped with your motherboard.  TL;DR this WILL work with your current PC setup.
I'll recommend the Transcend 256GB USB 3.0 External Solid State Drive, TS256GESD400K. This is an SSD in a USB 3.0 external enclosure. SSDs will help with write and read seek times, as well as proving generally more tolerant of drops and heat. The 256Gb size is on the small side, but this is just about the fastest product you can hope to get for your price point on the USB 3.0 interface.  For what it's worth, I'm slightly mystified by your troubles with booting OSes off USB 3.0 flash drives. I use one that uses Easy2Boot to store about four or five linux OSes, along with WindowsPE, Windows 10, and DOS. The only trouble I ever had with my connection speeds was RemixOS; that wouldn't start on my flash drive if it was plugged into USB 2.0 for some reason.
After some considerations I have decided for HIKVISION platform. I chose that platform over DASHUA mostly because of better support in my country and better firmware upgrade program.  Multiple platform (like DASHUA, HIKVISION, AVTECH etc.) cannot be mixed nowadays mostly because ONVIF G standard is not yet widely implemented. Some attempts like Ozeki SDK exist to unify surveillance devices in terms of universal software library, but downloading historical data is not supported on the DVR/NVR devices yet.  So it is better option to buy a new hybrid DVR on every site and use one common software like iVMS 4200.  Such a device is either  HCVR5104/5108/5116HS-S3 with SmartPSS or  DS-7204/7208/16HQHI-F1/N with iVMS 4200 (which I chose).  Hope one day the ONVIF G gets implemented and there will be a decent SDK or unversal tools to use it with various devices.
There's apparently NUC style passively cooled machines meant for displays that would work.  Discourse uses something very similar internally   I've been toying with buying one of these and it probably ticks off most of your boxes - intel ethernet, and 4 ports (realtek's a pain). I've run linux on a very similar platform. With the right variant, you got USB 3.0 + 2.5 inch drives, or msata.  I ended up picking up a slightly fancier model but you can get a 2 port model with a j 1800 or 1900, ram and storage for about us $150 upwards. It's fairly robust, has Intel lan adaptors (which I find better than realtek) and basic video outputs.  So yeah, they exist and for not much money.
There are USB 3 Type A male to USB Type C female adapters which allows me to plug in my flash disk at the same time.    https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ABTHI7C/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00  In retrospect maybe I should have gotten a usb c male to usb type a female adapter and just use one of my existing flash drives instead of buying a type c flash disk.  https://www.amazon.com/USB-Adapter-Converter-Connector-STANDARD/dp/B00ZVRHV2C
I ended up getting an APC Back-UPS 450VA BN450M costing approximately $50, but it was on sale for $10 off.  I've plugged-in the PC into the surge+battery and left everything else in the original surge protector for now.
I do not know everything there is to know about video signals, but given that your TV probably only takes analog inputs, I'm going to suggest the White PC VGA to AV TV RCA S-Video Converter Switch Box Adapter here. Not only is this cheaper than HDMI alternatives, it has a better chance (in my imperfect opinion) of having less latency, because converting VGA to RCA signal is a totally analog process and so (I'm guessing) much simpler to do. I also like that you can power it from a USB port; a nice bonus feature that makes the whole setup a little less byzantine.  There are HDMI to VGA/3.5mm converter boxes out there, but the ones I could find mentioned ~1s latency, which I would find unacceptable for gaming.
On the high end / Price range - You could always try ASRock Z77 Extreme4 ATX LGA1155. PCpartpicker doesn't indicate that the bios will need to be updated.   The Intel DH67BLB3 Micro ATX LGA1155 is a good micri ATX option. Its doesn't have as many sata ports as the ASRock, but it looks like there are enough to support your current build.   If these two options don't fit the bill. I would head over to pcpartpicker and put in your entire system minus the motherboard and see what options are compatible.  For a motherboard, I would try to stay in the realm of name brand and grab something with good reviews. Personally I'm a fan of MSI boards, don't know why. I've always used them for my intel builds and they seem to hold up well.   At the end of the day, there are alot of things you need to consider, form factor & sata ports & compatibility being the main things.
On Ebay(usa) the motherboard in question is listed from $150(us) and up.  From what I've read on the wikipedia page on microATX link  ÂµATX, mATX, and uATX are the same thing.  Possibly the HP boards may be a little of the standard microATX specs.  At the time I am writing this the exchange rate for USD to British Pound is $1USD = .77Pound.  So it may be around 115 Pounds for the board.  Not sure what the guy is charging for labor.  What would be really good to know is information on the chassis/case.  HP used to be all proprietary and have chassis/cases you could not put just any board in.   There are other things to note however.  As stated in the following link, some manufacturers use custom front panel connections that you may have to modify to use with an off the shelf board.  aforementioned link  Hope this helps, even if is not the answer you were looking for.
Insofar as a Steam Machine is a game console and is sold into that space, Steam Machines running plain SteamOS or Windows are supported by Unity and Game Maker Studio. As they are computers, they can be modded, and insofar as open source linux software like much of SteamOS goes, it can be "reverse-engineered" without much difficulty.   Where this kind of falls down is "popular" - there are really only two or three consoles that are actually "popular" - Xboxes, Playstations, and the Nintendo Wii U. Steam Boxes are a niche product, though they are widely popularly known.   In any case, one good example of a moddable steam machine would be the Maingear Drift Steam Machine. It's basically constructed out of off-the-shelf components and runs SteamOS without Windows, removing concerns one might have about inadvertently stepping on MS's toes.
Do you need any graphics acceleration? You could use multiple USB to VGA adapters if you are only using non graphics intensive apps. It is a cheap and easy solution. This guy on Ask Ubuntu reported that the UltraVideoÂ® USB 2.0 to DVI-I or VGA Video Adapter works fine on Ubuntu 14.04, although it is slow with the effects. You can try one before committing to buy multiple, since YMMV with those adapters.
I say get the Da Vinci Mini 3D printer, use that to print out plastic backings with a lip, and then print out stickers to put on top on a full-color inkjet printer of any description. You're looking at a total cost of well under $500, plus you get a much more versatile bit of kit into the bargain.
Any Nvidia, Intel (CPU+motherboard), or AMD GPU with a displayport technology level above 1.2 ought to work, at least with the proprietary drivers. The problem is making sure that you have the right cable connections - in some cases, active adapters and/or MST hubs may be needed to make all 4+ monitors work reliably.   If I had to recommend a GPU for you, I'd tell you to look at the Sapphire R7 250 Eyefinity Edition. You can connect two monitors to the DVI and HDMI ports, then add two or more displays using a splitter cable off the Display Port. Note that Sapphire claims it supports 3 displays in the tech specs, but the Eyefinity spec from AMD claims any GPU with that moniker supports 6. I believe this disparity is due to the fact Sapphire isn't including a DP splitter cable; such cards do work with up to six displays, as long as those displays don't exceed the total number of pixels each output is capable of pushing.   Alternatives on the Nvidia side are similar, if somewhat more expensive on average. The company really tries to push its Quadro NVS cards if you look at their official documentation, but at least in Windows I have experience using GTX cards with DP outputs to connect up to eight monitors successfully. I don't recommend that setup only because getting those cards to work in Windows was never as successful as with the AMD cards, and the many weird issues I encountered make me hesitate to recommend it for Linux, where support tends to be even more wonky.  The last thing I would like to mention is that unless space/energy is at a premium, it almost never makes sense to go with the NVS/Firepro solutions both companies offer up. These cards are expensive, inadequately cooled, and unecessary, because in reality you can just keep adding GPUs to computers and running additional displays off them without issues, so long as you have the bus connections (PCI-E normally, in this day and age). Thus in a computer with an Intel HD 4000 GPU on the CPU die connected to a DVI, HDMI, and DP out, adding two of the R7 250 Eyefinity edition GPUs above would allow that computer to push at least 3 displays on the Intel chip + 6 more on each GPU, for a total of 15 1080p displays. Any limits on that number discovered are more likely to be the fault of the OS than anything else, AFAIK.
Depending on your operating system you can set the automatic download locations for all your music, videos, documents, downloads etc for windows 10 and the file explorer.   Otherwise it just takes a careful eye when installing things to actually pause and read the path that you're installing or extracting things too. Also changing the library locations is very easy to do on all versions of windows.  You are right occasionally the misc file gets transferred to the OS drive accidentally, but this wont cause much of an issue in the long run. Simply watch your path destinations and you will be fine.   EDIT  You can also simply change the registry file that sets the default file path for installations: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion  http://www.thewindowsclub.com/change-default-program-files-directory-windows
If someone stumbled on this question, they might be interested to know the result.  So we contacted various companies, and at the end we compared the products from the following companies:   Waco, Jetter, NI (Compact), Siemens.   Our choice went for the Siemens products. So we acquired a S7-1512SP F-1PN, which had F-DI/F-DQ modules which allowed us to work with sensors in an Ex-Zone environment.  The deciding criteria for us were: Ex-Zone, CAN communication and price.     Much later, someone recommended Unitronics as alternative, but we haven't tested it for reasons beyond the scope of this question.
So, what you are going to want is an internal adapter. You have to be careful when doing this because poorly made ones can fry a motherboard really quick. I've seen cheap ebay adapters take other components hostage as well.   I did find the Vantec IDE to SATA converter on new egg. It has a 4 out of 5 star rating across 270 reviews. If this exact model doesn't fit with your current motherboard, because of tray restrictions or space issues you can also buy the adapters that are just the wires, without the plug interface the model above uses.    The most important thing is to find a product that has a lot of positive reviews. Like I've said, I've seen some of those power adapters kill a system. So do your homework and look at the reviews. Also with these old IDE drives, remember to have the pinout set to master.
2,000 isn't much. You can buy 1 very expensive desktop with that, or 5 reasonably priced ones. You want 30.  Assuming you want all workstations to be identical, this leaves you with 66 dollars and change per workstation. If an RPi costs 55 at your location, this would work.  To turn an RPi into a workstation, you'll need a mouse, keyboard, micro SD-card and monitor (assuming you already got HDMI cables and power adapters). You won't need an Ethernet cable, since the RPi 3 has WLAN. Still, 11 dollars for all those peripherals, it can't be done.  The processor of an RPI 3 B is a 1.2 GHz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8. That sounds good, but for a workstation, it's not a lot. If an application is not optimized to make use of multiple cores, this leaves you with at most 1.2 GHz per application. That's not a lot.  Is it usable as a workstation?  Yes. Somewhat. If you have some patience and don't make it do crazy things. Running a GUI IDE and a web-browser is something even the Model 1 could do. Just don't expect it to be fast. Compiling large projects will take a while. Also keep in mind 1 GB RAM is less than you're used to. Don't keep too many things open in the background.  Don't forget modern computers are often limited by their disk speed if they're not outfitted with SSD. Not by their processor core. A micro SD-card is even slower, much slower really, than a normal desktop HDD. Whatever you do, get some decent cards. The ones that don't go bust too easily and have a higher speed (Class 10).  What about the BeagleBoard?  Don't bother. You're talking educational here. There's simply much more content available for the RPi than for the BeagleBoard.
I recently decided to build my own wireless router - and I found the Airetos AEX-QCA9880-NX performing very well on my DIY machine: 3 channels 802.11ac/n/g in a miniPCIe shape.
$36 - Android with USB OTG support and OTG Player App  Get the iNOVA EX756 Android Tablet for $36 with the USB Video Player - OTG Player app. Or some other Android tablet or phone with USB OTG support.   Comes with a USB OTG cable, so you can plug in your flash drive (probably doesn't provide enough power to spin up a hard drive, though). SD slot only goes up to 32 GB, but you said "or USB" USB Video Player - OTG Player will play files directly from the USB device, without copying them to your tablet.  This means you shouldn't be limited by what size filesystems the tablet can access, just what the app can access, since the app accesses the USB device in raw form.   This How-To Geek article has some more tips on accessing a USB device from Android.
ODROID-XU4 lacks the features you marked as optional but has everything you require and is sold for $74 at the time of writing (with worldwide shipping) on hardkernel website, though the shop link doesn't seem to work. Anyway, it can be easily found on eBay and similar sites.
Unless your LAMP stack will see high load, the Raspberry Pi 3 is a perfect choice for your purposes. It can even be overclocked decently if you add a few small heatsinks to its chip surfaces.   I have successfully run a low-use LAMP stack off my Raspberry Pi A+, which is a single core 700mhz ARM CPU (I had it OC'd to 900mhz but whatever) with 256mb system RAM divided between the CPU and GPU!  These systems are stable as all get-out too. Mine is currently sitting on day 50+ of continuous operation with a custom distro (DietPi) running my FTP, SSH server, and at one point an aborted attempt at a custom Asterisk setup.
It looks like the ONVIF standard is the future way of getting recorded videos from devices like IP cameras.  By typing Profile G into this web page you can get a list of compatible device, mostly IP cameras, and very few client software apps (only 2).   Recordings are being accessed via URL like this  http://10.8.3.173/onvif/Recording  But we must still wait for a decent SDK, that would enable to create Onvif G profile client in languages like C#, so it is hardly usable yet.
It looks like normal older analog CCTV cameras pose no significant problem, they function basically the same regardless on manufacturer.  The problem arises with HD-SDI, HD-TVI, HD-CVI, AHD formats and IP cameras and different levels of built-in ONVIF support.  http://www.supercircuits.com/lp/compare-hd-analog-video-formats  So I have chosen   HIKVISION DS-7208/16HQHI-F2/N or similar, because it supports analog, AHD and HD-TVI cameras and a range of ONVIF IP cameras too. (Checked it with a new AVTECH IP camera and worked ok).  Dashua DVRs support different standard HD-CVI, so it is a matter of choice. HD-SDI cameras are generally a problem. Dashua has better versatility because their hybrid DVRs allow for connecting more IP cameras than HIKVISION. I like Dashua playback interface better, but some functions like setting expired time for streams work better on HIKVISION. Dashua does not allow setting auto deleting old records per stream, HIKVISION does.  Other relevant manufacturers like PINETRON do not offer those hybrid DVR models or I have not found it.
So I won't be able to answer your questions completely, but it looks like the requested features you're looking for has been done in the past. Here is what someone else has been able to do.         Vending Pi Board   A) Gather data from DEX Input / Output Port (Vending Machine Side).   B) Collect data from Humidity & Temperature Sensors inside Vending machine.   Stock Data (Total Sold, Product Price, Product Total Price).   Android Phone / Tablet used to download data from Raspberry Pi system via Bluetooth.

Check Vending machine location through GPS (Through Android Smart phone/Tablet)   On board Temperature sensor can control mini cooler fan for Vending Board system.   Status LEDâ€™s for error checking / troubleshooting.   2 micro switch to provide basic control ( shutdown, reboot)      It looks like they have a project page that outlines the entire process, and how it can be done again.    Here is the main URL Here is their project page, it looks like they sell the Raspberry pi already pre-configured  If this isn't an acceptable answer, I can continue dredging google to find what else you might need.
Its going to be hard to find a kit for $50 or less, but these are some kits for an affordable price which can be programmed to do what I think you might be looking for.  The first one here includes everything to build the bot: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Arduino-Starter-Kit-eBOT-Z-Smart-Car-Robot-Chassis-Bundle-DIY-New-from-USA-/252089921982?hash=item3ab1baf1be:g:vdEAAOSwrklVWX0K  This one is just the chassis and associated parts, if you already have an arduino and other parts laying around: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Ardokit-Smart-Robot-Car-Chassis-Kit-Speed-Encoder-Battery-Box-For-Arduino-/162229636923?hash=item25c5a3cf3b:g:1WwAAOSw-CpX9iWt  This one has tracks but costs a bit more and I'm not too familiar with its capabilities but since its arduino based it can be programmed to do whatever: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Makeblock-Creative-DIY-Bluetooth-Tank-Car-Robot-Starter-Kit-for-Arduino-Blue-USA-/262657815040?hash=item3d27a03200:g:5kcAAOSwFdtX0ogB  I know these links are frowned upon and this probably isn't an acceptable answer, but its going to be hard to answer without a link to a product that fits the question.
Since you like Ubiquiti (I love 'em) why not use their "In Wall" WiFi Access Point?    What I like about this solution is that it does exactly what you are looking to do all in one box:   Wifi Access Point PoE & Data Passthrough port for a VoIP phone, camera, etc. Standard Data port   The best part is, it goes into a standard wall or surface mount jack for a nice clean install.
I would get the 510s.  You can easily upgrade the SSD when you are ready, but for 10% more you not only get twice the memory but its DDR4 versus DDR3.
I have a preference for Synology.  Based on the D-Link specs you provided, either the "J Series" or the "Value Series" would be a good match.  Take a look at the Synology site for more details  Pretty much the features/specs are the same - especially when it comes to the software and firmware.  The only notable differences would be in the hardware specs.  I have an older model 212j that works flawlessly.  I have upgraded it to new versions of the OS with zero issues and is fully compatible with my setup.  I hang 3 USB drives off of it for backup and a USB flash disk for storage of my music.  What's nice here too is that you can get it "diskless" meaning the bays are empty.  This is how I bought mine (for under $200) at the time and put in two WD Red 3TB NAS drives cheaper than I could have bought it pre-populated.
The key word here is "Programming."  This can have a range of expectation from writing code that gets executed on another server (like a web app) to data modelling, to app development that needs virtualized machines.  With the price point you specified, I would go with....   any MacBook Pro from 2010 through 2013 if you like OS X or Sierra.  It will run Windows 10, but I wouldn't spend Apple money on a Windows machine A Dell XPS 15 if you want excellent portability, excellent graphics and a reliable machine A Dell Inspiron 5000 Series if you want great value and a 2-in-1.
To be completely honest with you, as long as you have a suitable surface to use the mouse on any mouse will work.  When it comes to ergonomics, there are extended armrests that can attach to a desk....example  Personally I have been using a MadCatz/Cyborg R.A.T.7 for since 2010, just replaced it with a new one after 6 years due to it dying after heavy use. I use the older versionRAT 7  It is a gaming mouse, but is can be customized, and you can add/remove weights, which for me helps deal with muscle twitches in my hands/wrists due to too many years on ADHD/Aspergers medications.  Have had no issue with RSI/RMI with this mouse.
I use a MadCatz R.A.T.7.   It's ergonomic, customizable, max of 6400dpi. I use it for everything, and only had to replace it recently after the old one got flaky after six years of heavy use...and some rough treatment when moving place to place.    RAT 7  I don't work for amazon or madcatz...
If you are looking for sub 30" 4k UHD displays, TVs are all above 30" from what I have been able to find.  there are plenty of gaming PC monitors in the 4k UHD realm though. I usually stick with Asus products, though everyone has their particular favorite manufacturers.  If I were going to upgrade to 4k using a less than 30" screen, I would go with this, though it is currently out of my price range:  example  Would like to add that I am in no way affiliated with the computer industry, and am not remunerated for recommending any brand.
Both of them look ok to me (the ones from Amazon and Crucial). Everything seems to match up: Form Factor (sodimm), Speed 1600Mhz, Model No.   In conclusion, it looks to me like the RAM you looked at and the RAM that Esbjorn suggested are compatible.
You might consider the Dell Alienware 15 Laptop for $1,349.99  It runs Windows 10 Home (64bit)  Intel i5 6300HQ - CPU  8GB ddr4 - RAM  GTX 1060 - GPU (I think its the same as the desktop 1060)  1TB 7200RPM - HDD
Even though a simple search of sites such as newegg would show examples I will post a few systems with the card specified, and within the stated budget.  ASUS ROG STRIX 15.6" G-sync GL502VM-DB71 Intel Core i7-6700HQ, NVIDIA GTX 1060 6 GB, 16 GB Memory, 1 TB HDD, Windows 10 Gaming Laptop VR Ready @ US$1399.99  MSI 15.6" GE62VR Apache Pro-024 Intel Core i7 6700HQ (2.60 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 12 GB Memory 256 GB SSD 1 TB HDD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop VR Ready On sale for US$1479.99 for next 15 hours  GIGABYTE 15.6" P55Wv6-PC3D Intel Core i7 6700HQ (2.60 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 16 GB Memory 256 GB SSD 1 TB HDD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop  @ US$1499.99
The security is also important so that I can load updates to it over next 5 years.   So, you want to keep this device for at leats 5 years, why not make a long time investment? I would recomend the UDOO Family or the Odroid Family (Both came with their own Ubuntu flavor - As in Raspbian, you could use Tomcat to deploy JSP or JSF.).      with no need for WiFi, HDMI, Audio etc.   The main attraction of the Pi 3 are the Wi-fi and Bluetooth, but you ain't going to use those. So better invest in RAM and a best processor.  For your budget an excellent investment would be the Odroid XU4  Processor:  Samsung Exynos5422 Cortexâ„¢-A15 2Ghz and Cortexâ„¢-A7 Octa core   CPUs: Mali-T628 MP6(OpenGL ES 3.0/2.0/1.1 and OpenCL 1.1 Full profile)  RAM: 2Gbyte LPDDR3 RAM PoP stacked  USB: 2xUSB 3.0 Host, 1 x USB 2.0 Host  Ethernet: Gigabit Ethernet port  Size: 82 x 58 x 22 mm approx.(including cooling fan) <--- This is a BIG plus.
Right now on Newegg, which I am guessing is your retailer of choice, there are better options available. Corsair's PSUs are good, and like any good PSU, they aren't really going to betray you (though I have seen them fail, that was in an office environment that I don't really feel reflects on how they would perform in a home environment).   However, their brand name and the big marketing push that Corsair constantly makes puts a premium on their products and I don't usually find that their real value is reflected in their price compared to products from other vendors putting out PSUs in the same category.   In this case, a good example would be the Rosewill Photon-650. It's the same price (cheaper if you don't do rebates), same efficiency, same modular cabling, but it's rated 100W higher and is made by the OEM Highpower. Corsair's is probably a CWT or Great Wall OEM, for reference. I tend to think those OEMs do similar build quality most of the time, but if you know differently then perhaps that will be the final differentiator for you.  People tend to think of Rosewill as a brand that doesn't really stand out, but they do sometimes go out and get good OEMs to do their work for them. Since Corsair mostly does the same for their PSUs, I find no reason to pay more for less in this situation.
Powerline Adapter with PoE Injector (~$60)  Update 10/19/2017  A year later, I wholeheartedly recommend a Powerline (aka Homeplug) adapter with POE, rather than a wireless bridge. I still haven't found any wireless bridges with POE out for less than $100, but in the meantime, the handful of COPS-928-POE have been working great. I definitely recommend this option for connecting remote IP phones. This is a decent option for remote security cameras as well.  The idea behind PoE was to make it easy to send power to devices where you had Ethernet (or could easily wire Ethernet), but no power, but if you happen to have power, but no Ethernet at the place where your PoE-powered device needs to go, a POE PSE Powerline adapter is a better option than a wireless bridge. The Powerline adapter sends its signal via the existing electrical wiring in your house, and will generally  encounter less interference than a wireless adapter (unless you have a lot of AC motors running, like vacuum cleaners or heavy machinery).  The TP-Link AV200 Nano has been working great as the other end of the Powerline bridge, by the router. This end of the Powerline bridge doesn't need PoE out, and the AV200 adapter is cheaper than the higher-bandwith AV500 adapters (and later). An IP phone doesn't need much bandwidth, so the ~70 Mbps supported by the AV200 is plenty.  Original Post:  After several hours of research, I'm feeling pretty confident that a wireless bridge with a built-in 802.3af PoE injector doesn't exist except for industrial applications. However, you can get a Powerline ethernet bridge with a built-in POE injector, though they can be a bit harder to find.  Side note: no, I am not getting EoP confused with PoE. There really are devices that can go from EoP to PoE in a single unit.  The lowest-clutter solution to connect the phone to the network and provide PoE is a Powerline Ethernet Bridge with PoE Injector, such as the Comtrend Powergrid 9141s-poe Powerline Network Adapter or the COPS-928-POE, available on eBay.    Low clutter: the only item close to the phone is Powerline adapter. The phone connects directly to the Powerline adapter, which outputs 802.3af, so no need for a separate PoE injector. The only cable is the Ethernet cable going from the phone to the Powerline adapter. There's not even a power cord, since the device is a wall wart.  This is slightly more clutter than a wireless bridge, because you also need a Powerline adapter near the router that is compatible with the Homeplug AV standard, such as the TP-Link AV200. But at least the extra clutter is with all your other network equipment clutter, instead of cluttering your desk.   Cable > Modem > Ethernet cable > Powerline adapter > Outlet > Electrical Wiring > Outlet > Powerline adapter with PoE > Ethernet Cable > Phone">  Easy setup: Since this solution is for a home user who will probably need to set it up himself, you want the simplest possible setup. Powerline is plug-and-play: just plug in both adapters and push the button on each one to connect them.  Better for phones anyway: Powerline has less packet loss than WiFi, which means better call quality [citation needed].  UPDATE (10/24/2016) I tested the COPS-928-POE paired with TP-LINK AV200 Nano. They established a link within seconds after plugging them in. COPS-928-POE powered up my phone right away, and my phone connected to the server a few seconds after the two Powerline adapters established a connection with each other. I hit the security button on both adapters to establish a secure link, and everything reconnected again within 15 seconds. There was no noticeable difference in call quality, compared to my Ethernet connection. Since they are now paired and ready to go, I will be shipping the pair to the home user, confident they will be able to get these set up fairly easily.
As far as HDMI pass-thru receivers, yes they are on the market.    I am currently using a Denon AVR-1513  to route output from my PC/Xbox One, to my HDTV via HDMI.  This specific unit has 3 input with one output as far as HDMI goes, along with the usual optical/coaxial/RCA/ outputs you would expect.  Mine is a bit lower end so it only has pin connectors while higher end units have bind post connections.  The model I currently have has been discontinued, but I would recommend the one I ended up installing for my parents:Denon AVR-S500BT  This unit may/may not meet your needs exactly, but I hope at least gets you going in the right direction.
I like the cut of this Lenovo's jib: the Ideapad 310 80ST0005US. With one of the new quad core Bristol Ridge APUs inside and support for HDMI 2.0, it definitely supports 4K screens. Likely to also be a relatively performative bit of hardware, as well.   It's a bit pricey, but perhaps now that you know you need HDMI 2.0 to be certain of 4K, you can find it, or something like it, cheaper elsewhere.
Steelseries Rival 100    Costs around 40$ so not the cheapest but sa far as I'm concerned it really is a great mouse :   Nice and sober design ; exists in different colors so you can pick you favourite RGB lighting Side "back and forward" (default, but mappable to macros) buttons Made of a soft matter that feels very comfortable in hand (as for the black and yellow version I am using, and the full black one) Wired Ambidextrous Button to switch DPI Is fully editable (macros, colors, button roles, DPI modes, angle correction) through Steelseries Engine software, which is amazing (in comparison with, for instace, Razer Synapse) Is still comfortable to use even after hours of playing   I bought it three months ago and I am a big fan of it. Plus I got a free mousepad from Steelseries for my purchase, and the two work perfectly well together.
I would suggest the ASUS PCE-AC56 802.11ac   The main reason I would suggest this card over the nano:  Listed technical specs on both adapters @ newegg.com  TP-Link:  Wireless N speed up to 150Mbps   Asus:  802.11a/b/g/n/ac: downlink up to 1300Mbps, uplink up to 1300Mbps (20/40/80MHz)  The TP-link is much less expensive, and easier to install, but could be a bottleneck depending on your broadband package, or if you intend to run wireless AC.
Personally, I would spend the time and do a proper CAT5e/6 installation; meaning running cable in/through the walls, terminating properly, hiding the network gear so it's out of sight.  The benefit of being directly connected is the reliability of the connection is so much greater than that of WiFi.  But...  If you want to go wireless, I would forgo the USB route and go for a PCIe Wi-Fi adapter.  It's not that USB is bad in any sense of measure, it's just you will get better reliability being directly attached to the PCIe bus rather than the USB bus.  I have used the ASUS Dual-Band Wireless-AC1900 PCI-E Adapter (PCE-AC68) on a computer out in a warehouse where we couldn't easily run a network cable until we could get a crew with a scissor lift.        What was nice about this particular model was that you had the option of plugging the antenna directly into the card or (what we did) use the optional "base."  This allowed us to put the antennas up high, away from the metal desk as to not interfere with the radio signal.    The reason I mention this over USB adapters and obviously cheaper alternatives is because you mentioned "a gaming mobo."  Gaming requires bandwidth and this will deliver every time.
Having done many ERP integrations in warehouses and retail, there was pretty much one wireless barcode scanner that stood out and that was Symbol (now Zebra).    They do make a Bluetooth scanner - DS6878SR and given your (increased) budget this should work nicely.  Personally, I wouldn't go for the smaller name scanners.  Symbol is an industry standard and their reliability is unmatched.
I'll throw in a recommendation for the Dell XPS line of products.  These are super elegant machines with great specs.  I especially like the "Infinity Edge Display."  As for your requirement of supporting 4K displays:    Every XPS model, from the 13" entry level to the top of the line 15" all have the same display support, so your options here are plentiful.
If you are looking for the next 5 years of life, why not look at a (refurbished) Dell Small Form Factor PC?    A core i3 or i5 (I recommend the latter) will be more than enough for 5+ years of use, plus you get the backing of a big name.  Parts are simple and easy to come by and because this is an Optiplex product (meaning it's for business, not home), it comes with built in security features like:   case tamper switching vPro technology remote management option for KACE management   The price point for these machines are about $150 to $200.  They are more than the Raspberry Pi units but what you will save in time and debugging will more than make up for it.  Remember, it will be much easier to get peripherals and devices working on this in Linux than on a Pi.  Upgrading is very easy.  I upgraded one that I use for my pfSense router to 8GB of RAM for under $20 with memory found on eBay.  I installed a 16GB SSD also found on eBay for less than $10.  The most expensive component was my quad gigabit ethernet card for $60.  Since you are running a LAMP stack (may I also suggest you dump Linux and go FreeBSD as it much, much more reliable as an AMP server) you may want to add additional network ports.  This is easy and very inexpensive on this - no so on a Pi - just get a PCIe network adapter and away you go.
If you're not going to be overclocking (though if you have that system, why wouldn't you be overclocking is likely a better question), then the Intel Xeon E5-1620 V4 is a better gaming processor than the Intel Core i7-5820K or the Intel Core i7-6800K. Those processors feature more cores and threads but lower clock speeds, and games don't yet really need more than eight threads. The lower price on the E5-1620 v4 is nice too.   The only real downside here is that this is a locked processor, so you won't have any ability to overclock. If for some reason you're not going to be doing that, then by all means get the Xeon mentioned above.
It's going to be very difficult to find a quad port SATA controller that does not have RAID capabilities built in so you might as well get it with RAID and just not turn on that feature.  It is nice, however, to know that you can go RAID if you want to later down the line.  That said, I would stay away from the smaller brands that don't have a strong reputation.  I have used RAID from LSI Logic (now Avago) because they are the OEM manufacturer for some big names like Dell and Apple.    In fact, you can get Dell and Apple branded RAID controllers to work in pretty much any machine; I have done so in the past.  For your application, you just need a simple quad port SATA RAID controller like the LSI Logic 9211-4i.  Just remember, you will need the mini SAS to SATA breakout cable.
That's a tall order for a CPU from 2011. The Supermicro Motherboard MBD-C7Q67-O looks like it should fit the bill, however.  The only caveat is the front USB 3.0 headers (I took it as "you would like to have" rather than "required"), but those can be easily added with an add on card.  The full specifications can be found here.  As for the price, Newegg and Amazon both have it for more the $200, while you can get it for under $50 used/refurbished on eBay
I personally like the LSI (now Avago) brand of products.  They are actually an OEM for IBM, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, and (when they made Xserve) Apple.  There's a really good HCL (Hardware Compatibility List) on FreeBSD's website that list all the compatible HBAs.    The card that I would recommend that hits all of your points is the 3WARE Sas 9750-8I.  This is actually an LSI OEM and (uses the LSI RAID on Chip - RoC).  As for ZFS, you shouldn't have any issue with ZFS and these HBA's.  ZFS is just the file system and I have yet to have an issue with ZFS on any of the systems I have deployed with LSI HBAs.
I recently (2 month ago) bought a HP ProLiant MicroServer Gen8 G1610T.  Here is what you get for about 170â‚¬ (Here in Germany on amazon) at the lowest configuration:   4 SATA III drive bays One internal SATA slot which is intended to be used for the optical drive but it can be exploitet as 5th HD slot 4 GB ECC Ram which is extendable to up to 16 GB Intel Celeron dual-core with up to 2,3 GHZ Socket 1150 (You could upgrade to a Xeon CPU if you like) 3 gigabit Ethernet ports where one is shared with the ILO remote server management console Yes you get a full blown remote management interface which allows you to monitor the hardware, install the operating system and you even have a virtual KVM which also allows mounting of ISO images over ethernet. However you need the professional license to use all features which costs about 40 â‚¬. USB3 on the back (2), USB2 on the front (2) back (2) and internal (1) one low profile PCIe slot which you could use to install a "true" RAID controller An emulated RAID controller which can operate 1, 0 and 10 arrays. And many more, have a look at the datasheet   I'm up and running with RHEL installed on a separate SSD so that I can use all 4 drive bays for my RAID 1 (4x4 TB WD red). I'm using it for several Docker containers to run LAMP stacks, NAS and cloud software and home automation servers but the device is running quietly and I'm satisfied with the performance.  Problems I ran into:   Only VGA graphics available, this was a little bit difficult at the beginning since I don't have a VGA or DVI compatible display here. I decided to use the ILO console to install things. It was a little bit hacky to install the system on a SSD on the 5th SATA slot but there are manuals out there.   I can highly recommend this rig.
Looking at your requirements it may just be easier to get an Android smart phone.  You can backup your contacts and numbers to a Google Account , standard smart phones will have a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm headphone jack and high quality sound. I suggest the Lenovo A806 Specs are here: http://www.gsmarena.com/lenovo_golden_warrior_a8-6529.php
The very best mechanical keyboard out there, bar none, at any price is the Corsair K70 RapidFire RGB with exclusive Corsair/Cherry MX Speed switches. The keys have an extremely nimble and responsive 45-gram actuation force and merely 1.2mm of key travel for both speed typing and gaming. The lighting is stellar with the only complaint from users is that there are too many lighting options to choose from. The high-impact aircraft brushed aluminum frame and knurled volume knob put this outstanding piece of engineering excellence "over the top." You can pay more than $164.95 for a more expensive keyboard, but you would only be throwing away good money. See what I mean...  Here is another exciting review of the K70 RapidFire RGB. Enjoy!
The MSI Apache Pro-024 is consistently one of the most highly rated laptops made in 2016. NewEgg lists this model at $1399 with a $50 rebate for a limited time only. Be aware that the 17" model, Apache Pro-023 is the same price, but it will be large and have less "portability" as you put it. I note that of all the laptops sold in the world today, NZKshatriya and I chose the same model as the very best you will find. That should tell you something. I personally would opt for the 17" version, but I'm not you and I won't have to lug it around.   As far as HD gaming performance is concerned, one reviewer stated that his unit blew through Fallout and Witcher 3 at full detail settings without so much as a hiccup. Witcher 3 as you surely know is one of the most graphically intensive games ever produced. This comes as no surprise from MSI and the GTX 10 series. The infinitely programmable steelseries backlit RGB keyboard is a bonus that I would not even expect at this price point, but you get it anyway. What more can I say!  Okay, I know what else: It has a 256GB solid-state Windows 10 system drive and another whole terabyte of magnetic drive storage. Are you kidding me? I've seen units going for $2500 that can't hold a candle to this rig.
The Asus PA329Q is out now:   4k, 32" 10-bit IPS   Color spaces:   sRGB, Adobe RGB Rec.709 DIC-P3 Rec. 2020, the wide gamut color space specified for HDR
Be realistic with this emerging technology  For the most part, few people can tell the difference between the 65,536 colors of 16-bit RGB color and the 16,777,216 colors of 24-bit color, let alone the more than one billion colors of HDR. The human eye can distinguish only eight million colors. As an experiment, make a quick app or a web page with two adjacent squares on it. Make one square the color #4747E7 and the other box #4747E8. Then ask ten people if they are the same color. Do the same experiment with two squares that are one pixel in height. You begin to see the non-essential nature of 10-bit color channels.  Just in case you want to see for yourself, paste this code into notepad, name it box_demo.htm, and then run it  A   B C D     HDR, obviously, stands for High Dynamic Range. Dividing each RGB color channel into 1024 gradients instead of merely 256 by itself does not automatically extend dynamic range.  Already, quality IPS monitors are delivering million-to-one and higher contrast ratios. 40"-60" 4K televisions from Samsung, LG, Sony, NEC exhibit breathtaking detail and dynamic range and double as very passable PC monitors. While HDR is an evolutionary step forward, how valuable is it in actual use? At this point in time, hi-fidelity enthusiasts would undoubtedly find greater gains by optimizing existing 32-bit technology than by obsessing over the questionable performance gains of so-called HDR. If you pay attention to product specifications, you will see that many monitors already support "1.07 billion colors" without explicitly claiming HDR optimization.  A fact that some younger techs and readers fail to appreciate is that many of us grew up in an era in which 800x600@256 color was passable. 1024x768@65K color was preferred, and 1280x1024@16.7M color was the ideal to which we aspired. There is no practical difference between 24-bit RGB color and 32-bit RGB color. But, starting with Windows Vista, Microsoft changed the default desktop Windows Presentation Foundation rendering engine from DirectDraw (2D) to DirectX (3D) which natively supports 32-bit RGBA color, the "A" standing for alpha, or transparency. This was a significant and important technological implementation that has allowed native 3D desktop effects and semitransparent window and fade effects.  Don't get me wrong, I am wholly in favor of the global adoption of a 10-bit byte. 1024 makes a whole lot more sense to me than 256. Having a 40-bit dword rather than a 32-bit dword allows for a trillion values rather than merely 4.3 billion. But until that happens the 30-bit HDR color schema will be more of a marketing ploy than a viable and useful technology upgrade. Your money would be better-spent by upgrading to a monitor with a practical and proven technology like nVida's G-Synch or ATI/AMD's FreeSynch (as noted by NZKshatriya below.)  Who among us would not  drool over this non-HDR 28" 4K LG monitor!!
Great System Design, Daniele!  For all of your components you'll need about:   170 watts for your 1060 GPU 160 watts for 16 GB of RAM 91 watts for the i7-6700 30 watts for your drives 25 watts for the cooling system 40 watts for the Motherboard   Minimum TDP Requirement: 516 watts  Recommendation: Opt for a 600W PSU to give yourself some headroom for OC or additional widgets.  Here is a reasonably priced generic 600W PSU from ePower for $39.99  If your heart is set on modular Corsair, this refurbished 650M is only $59.99   newegg.com
In Make magazine, Vol. 49 March 2016, they mention the C.H.I.P, this is a $9 single board computer, though it is not yet shipping, and is scheduled to start shipping November 2016.    There is also the Adafruit Trinket - Mini Microcontroller - 5V Logic  $6.95.  Full details listen at linked site.  Information on page does state to use the 3V version if you intend to run on LiPo batteries, and for devices that require 3V logic.    Also there are a couple of listed tradeoffs for this unit, again from the units data page:  Trinket does not have a Serial port connection for debugging so the serial port monitor will not be able to send/receive data  Some computers' USB v3 ports don't recognize the Trinket's bootloader. Simply use a USB v2 port or a USB hub in between.  Also states that while the Trinket is programmed via the Aduino IDE, it is not 100% Arduino compatible.  I hope this answer helps.  EDIT Oct 20, '16:  I failed to notice that the Trinket does not seem to have internet access.    There is a tiny programmable wifi card ESP8266  So you can add wireless capability to devices without built in LAN/Wifi connectivity.
After several calls/mails to the 4 major "grand public" motherboard manufacturer, it's was either a non-understanding/no response or we will call you back later to have more details.  It's seems they don't want to implement it do to the fear that novice user will look themselves out of their SEDs.  I was only be able to speak with the technical support of ASRock (here the raw answer) :     All our Intel 100 Series Mainboard have this function. Built in.      Our AMD mainboards not. But it might be possible to make a new BIOS   for that.       I can check with BIOS department, if they can provide   special BIOS for the mainboard you wish to haveâ€¦   So basically you should buy ASRock motherboards if you want this, either directly if it's a Intel 100 series or if not, asking before buying if they can make you a custom BIOS with this option for the board you are willing to buy.
550W is enough and gives you enough room for overclocking I think... Also, the power supply you have in mind is Gold rated and, as I understand, that's as important as the watt quantity.  Also, the 1060 is very power efficient so you should be ok. As an alternative, I have the EVGA 550W G2  which is also great, its pretty much like the one you indicated  I'm running a i5-6600k and a nVidia GTX 970 which is much more power hungry than your graphics card, both are overclocked, 16 gb of ram and everything works fine!
using Cooler Masters PSU calculator, the power draw for your listed components is 297w.....  Outervision.com lists at 287w  MSI.com shows the lowest at 248w.  I would recommend:  EVGA SuperNOVA 550.  It is fully modular, has plenty of power for your current application plus future modifications. The unit is certified 80 Plus Gold.  And the unit comes with a 7 year warranty, which never hurts anything.  The only thing I saw missing from your build was Optical media and/or magnetic/spindle based storage.  Are you planning on only using the one SSD?
The Razer Blade Stealth looks insanely good and is the laptop I would definitely buy if I had the money... It will suit all your needs at the price you want, but it might be slightly overkill, however, if you want the fastest possible I suggest this one  Razer Site  Amazon Page  I think macs also do a fine job and I see lots of programmers using them, but I don't really like Mac OS and don't know enough about them to give good advice
Yeah, it is very opinion based... at the end of the day, it is your decision. I have a Motorola Moto Watch 2nd Gen, the starting price is Â£239ish. I like watches with a circular display, so I chose this watch. At that time, the Huawei watch was a bit more costly. Despite the 'flat tire' display of the Moto Watch (the black bit at the bottom of the display) I sort of liked the watch. It's got great specs.   My best tip for you is to look at reviews and most importantly the specifications of the device itself. Trust me, the specs will tell you a lot about the watch!  Hope I helped!  Sid
As you have surely discovered, options for a 4K monitor above 32" are very limited. Magnavox offers a 40" for about $899 that, because of some minor image instability issues, did not receive very positive reviews when it was released at the beginning of 2016. Newegg offers two discount brands that make a 40" monitor, namely Wasabi-Mango and Yamakasi. These do not appear to have positive customer feedback.  Newegg offers one model of 43" 4K display (which also supports 10-bit color.) This, again, is the Korean Wasabi-Mango. Positive feedback for this model included one new owner who said "anything from 720p to 2160p content ... looks amazing." Another measured actual power output as 61 to 66 watts. Another reviewer ditched his Roku3 and bought a Roku4 because as he said, "watching 4K content is fantastic on this monitor." This customer also hooked up a Raspberry Pi to it, and the setup worked just fine. At $769 the 43" Wasabi-Mango is not extremely cheap, but it isn't much more than what you would pay for a high quality 4K LED-TV.  A question often asked is: Should I just use a 4K flatscreen for my monitor?   The mainstream 43" 4K TVs at Newegg ranged in price from $379 (Visio/Hisense) to $649 (Sony/Samsung) which do function passably as PC monitors, but not optimally so, especially for graphic arts and photography where you need color calibration and image stability. My experience with using an LED-TV as a monitor is that the colors tend to be "bleedy" and somewhat hyper-realistic. You can have problems with ghosting and image jitter as well. As TVs, flatscreen LEDs are designed to display moving pictures and be viewed from a distance.   I could tentatively recommend the 43" Wasabi-Mango UHD430 at this time based on owner feedback, but it would probably be in your best interests to see what pans out after the holidays. This is going to be a hot market segment, and competition will push prices to more consumer-friendly levels by spring/summer 2017.  The formula for determining dot pitch on a 3840x2160 format is 4405/diagonal_size.  So with your most standard 4K monitor size of 28" you'll have 4405/28" = 157 dpi. 43" monitors approach the ideal scaling ratio of 96 dpi: 4405/43 = 102 dpi. This is good size limit. It's hard to imagine how enormous a 43" screen is until you're actually sitting in front of it 18 inches away.
You should get a Nook.  There are several variances to the Nook e-reader - mainly it's between the Simple Touch, Simple Touch with GlowLight, and now GlowLight Plus.  Basically it whether you want a backlight or not or you want refurbed or new.  Let's see how it stacks up with your requirements:   Everything FOSS.  Moot point.  Every ereader comes with built in firmware and regardless if it's based on open source or not, it's going to have proprietary software to work with their hardware.  Not only that, for DRM protected content, they are going to have to license the code that allows them to use that protected content.   There's no way around this, but it really doesn't matter;  where are you going to open source download ereader firmware that's actively developed Must support EPUB and PDF.  Nearly every E-Reader on the market, with the exception of the Amazon Kindle, supports the EPUB format and virtually all except for an early Amazon Kindle and a discontinued Sony Libre support PDF.1 Lightweight.  This is purely subjective; what you can carry for 2 hours per day is totally different from what anyone else can carry for 2 hours per day.  However, the Nook e-readers have consistently weighed less than 8oz (half pound) or less than 200g. Long battery life.  Again, very subjective as your use will vary in relation to everyone else's.  However, based on the B&N spec page, it will last up to 6 weeks on a single charge 2.   USB connectivity.  The Nook shows up as external storage whether on a PC or a Mac.       1 Wikipedia:  Comparison of eBook Readers  2  Per B&N:  Based on 30 minutes of reading per day and 1 page refresh per minute with GlowLight at 30% brightness and wireless off. Battery life tests conducted using specific units; actual results may vary based on device settings, usage, and many other factors.
Just came across another option: TrackR bravos are little sub-$30 transponders with a one-year battery life, though apparently they depend on a device running their app to come within 100 feet of the transponder to update its location.
I've used Topaz (GE) for many years and was pretty strong.  That brand has been acquired by Interlogix and they have since discontinued it for TruPortal.  It meets all of your  points with the exception of the first (good looking) and the last (not designed by idiots); those are purely subjective and impossible to quantify.
Well, some more information would be appreciated.    Use case:  First, what kind of games do you play? Let us assume AAA titles as they tend to be the most demanding in terms of hardware. Second, what resolution and refresh rate do you play at? For 1080p, 60Hz you will be more than fine. Arguably, for that resolution your GTX 1080 is a bit overkill; a 1070 should suffice.  For 1440p you should be able to max out all titles, possibly with a lighter form of anti-aliasing and a smaller sample count.  Anything 4k you will not need heavy AA in the first place, so with tweaking demanding effects like some lightnings and AO you will be able to maintain 60 FPS.    Suggested changes:  My recommendation for your build would be to change the CLC to a good air cooler. They are bulkier indeed, but offer equal, if not better, performance at the same price point often with less noise produced. Something like this should do the job, and do it good. On that note, if you intend to go past a soft CPU overclock (anything over 1.28-1.3VCore) for 24/7 usage, I would recommend a motherboard with a beefier power phase design.    Further information:  The number of SSDs doesn't really matter, unless you need the tremendous speed from a RAID 0 array. On that subject, you could use the m4 socket for the same SSD and squeeze out some extra performance while having less clutter.    Fans:   Should you decide to stay with the AIO, I could not recommend the EK Vardars enough to put on the radiator - I run a total of 12 fans on my rads and I'm very happy with them!   Case fans: well I use Vardars on mine, but I've heard that the Corsair SP120 fans are great.     P.S. Sorry but I cannot provide more than two links due to lack of Reputation. :)
I've recently started using and recommending the Sandisk Ultra II drives for any relatively weak machines which do not do big continuous writing tasks. It fits your criteria and is quite good (until you fill up the SLC cache - 10GB for the 240GB model).
Go with the Samsung EVO 850 or the Crucial MX300 275GB.  I have used them in everything from Dell Latitudes, HP Desktops (I forget the model) to MacBook Pros and even my own personal iMac.  Personally, I wouldn't go with a SSD from a company that's not known to make quality memory modules (because that's technically what an SSD is). I'm not saying any of the off brands are "bad," it's just there is a "piece of mind" factor when it comes to my data and I would prefer to know a reputable brand well known for what they do.  It's as the old saying goes "You never get fired for buying IBM."  If you are upgrading your laptop and want more speed, I would also recommend upgrading your RAM to 8GB; that the max for your machine.
Like Digital Boffin said, you're not going to be able to get something worthwhile under $10. I also use a Blue Snowball for recordings and it works very well. If you poke around on ebay, you may be able to find a used Blue Snowball. I was able to find one here on ebay for $25. If you want to get something that's new, you're going to have pay at least $50 for something decent like the Snowball Ice. Or about $70 for the "real" Snowball. n.b. the snowball is a USB mic.  In conclusion:   A mic under $10 probably isn't worth it (esp. for the conditions you described) You're probably going to  need to spend at least $50 or more for something decent like the Snowball or Snowball  Ice. If $50 is too far out of your price range, you could try poking around on ebay for a used Snowball or something similar (I was able to find one for about $25 w/o shipping, which shouldn't be to expensive)
In case your radio won't take a USB input... Here are a couple 3.5mm options:   Poking around Amazon I found the "Floureon BM-800 Condenser Sound Studio Recording Broadcasting Microphone" for $30 it's the best seller so it's probably not too bad. "Tonor 3.5mm Studio Professional Microphone Mic with Stand For Audio Sound Recording Skype Desktop PC Laptop Notebook" for $10.99, also on amazon.com.   But like I mentioned earlier, you generally get what you pay for... Higher price generally = Higher quality, more reliability. Caveat emptor.
I strongly recommend against cheap PSU units or actually purchasing without researching a bit first. A lot of the units on the market have really bad voltage regulation, especially on the 3.3V and 12V rails along with bad ripple. Furthermore, a cheaper PSU is more likely to trip on an input load that supposedly matches the output (for example 600W wall draw instead of 600W delivered on the rails).    While it's generally true that with mild overclocking it will do 'fine', after all, the power supply must supply the motherboard, GPU and peripheral devices with clean power. I would not trust any components whose power load may spike on a cheap supply.    From the recommendations above I support the EVGA and RoseWill supplies, and I'd also add most SuperFlower and SeaSonic supplies you can get your hands on. FSP (previously known as Fortron) also have very decent units that do not come off as expensive.     Regarding power draw, @Brett Bergan's suggestion for 160W for the RAM is outlandish. DDR4 RAM (without a ridiculous overvolt) will rarely consume over 3-4W per module.    As for power supply, I would actually recommend a SeaSonic M12II 520 Bronze which is surprisingly cheap while still retaining full modularity and providing clean output.    520W will be more than enough for your system until you decide to push things to the limits, and those PSUs can be trusted. I've pulled over 1100W from the wall on my 850W unit (SS-850AM, Bronze efficiency) which is a bit over it's rated output and still didn't even trigger it's OCP.
I consider Brett's answer incomplete and rather subjective, so I'll toss in my two cents.    First, there are great differences between the different switch types - and some of them can be rather annoying to the wrong person! It all boils down to preference.    I will explain in short:  1. Linear and Tactile  - Linear switches travel smoothly right down to the bottom. There is no feedback to your finger when the actuation happens so unless you are confident about the key travel/bottom-out (or look at your screen) you cannot be certain that the key has been actuated.  -  When you push down a tactile switch, you can feel the actuation for when it happens the switch will give in a bit. In other words, the peak actuation force required for activation is a bit higher and upon activation it drops. Out of these, I prefer linear for typing and tactile when gaming.  2. Clicky and Silent  (applies only to tactile switches) The names are pretty self-explanatory. I recommend watching a couple of videos in order to gather an idea about how clicky switches sound. Many people are very annoyed with the sound while others love it. Be very careful when you pick this for your girlfriend as it can turn out to be an annoyance either for you or for her...or both of you might actually enjoy it! ;) I used to like clicky switches back in the day but I've grown to admire the soft bottom-out sound only.  3. Actuation force Different switches have different springs in them - some are lighter, while some are heavier. This is again a very important factor because some people tend to rest their fingers on the keyboard and are likely to accidentally actuate them. I like heavier keys (60-70 grams peak actuation force) but most people tend to like 45g springs.  4. Switch travel - Classic Cherry switches have a 2mm travel before actuation, out of a total of 4mm travel. - The new Cherry switches, Silver use the lighter (45g) springs and are a linear switch with a shorter travel time (1.2mm actuation, 3.4mm total travel distance).    Kailh switches are basically a Cherry MX rebrand after their trademark expired. There are also other brands which copy Cherry but let us not digress that far.    Now that you know all this, here is a listing of the most common Cherry MX switches:  (switch colour - tactility, noise, stiffness, travel)     Red - Linear, Silent, Soft (45g), Normal (2/4mm)   Silver - Linear, Silent, Soft (45g), Short (1.2/3.4mm) Brown - Tactile, Silent, Soft (45g), Normal (2/4mm)   Blue - Tactile, Clicky, Soft (50g), Normal (2/4mm)   Black - Linear, Silent, Stiff (60g), Normal (2/4mm)   Green - Tactile, Clicky (loud), Stiff (80g), Normal (2/4mm)   Clear - Tactile, Silent, Stiff (65g), Normal (2/4mm)   Grey (dark) - Linear, Silent, Stiff (80g), Normal (2/4mm)   Grey (light) - Tactile, Silent, Stiff (80g), Normal (2/4mm)   White - Tactile, Clicky (soft), Stiff (80g), Normal (2/4mm)     As for a keyboard recommendation, there are also different formats - depending on the use case, you might not need a numpad. I will recommend in each:  Full size: Ducky Shine 5 RGB, because Sturdy and overall flawless build quality, which is very characteristic for the Ducky brand. Those keyboards are held in high regard even in the keyboard enthusiast circles; You can pick between Cherry MX Brown, Red, or Black switches; Plug-and-Play; 14 pre-programmed lightning modes, along with 2 fully customizable (per-key brightness, colour, and pulsation); ABS Double-shot keycaps. ABS is a high quality plastic (usually last for well over 15 years before losing its characteristics) and only very rarely do you find stock PBT caps, with PBT being considered by many the ultimate plastic allow to last nearly forever on a keyboard; All the macro and settings profiles are stored on the built-in memory, meaning you can move it wherever and still keep your settings;  USB cable is detachable and replaceable. You can buy another, fancier one, or make your own if you so desire! What the keyboard lacks for some people are dedicated multimedia/additional buttons, however all that either built-in (Fn+key combo) or is fully customizable anyway.  Tenkeyless: Ducky One RGB TKL, because It sports a smaller size and is a more compact fit on your desk, leaving more space for your mouse and providing a more comfortable stance with less spread hands; Again a very solid build quality; Slim bezels and compact frame which further enhance the space-saving benefit of TKL keyboards; Detachable and replaceable cable allows for better portability; Plug-and-play; Again ABS doubleshot keycaps with sandblasted finishing; Cherry MX Blue, Red or Brown switches; 10 lighting presets with three custom lighting zones; Evenly lit legends on the keycaps.
Samsung offers professional customization for many of their products, including locking down to one dedicated app, (re)branding and whatever else. It is called Samsung Knox Customization. This solution is over-the-top for my own purpose, but it may be useful for you.
After a brief search in hardwire.in, I recommend: AMD: RX 460 NVidia: GTX 1050 Ti  Out of the two, I would go with the GTX 1050 Ti.    That way, your GPU would be decent for playing games when you upgrade to a 1080p monitor. 1440p or more would require tuning settings down.      Converting your budget into USD, I would suggest:    AMD: RX 470  NVidia: GTX 1060   Either would be more than powerful for your CPU+Monitor combination. :)
I would suggest the following: pcpartpicker.com:  AMD build rev 3   Under the budget maximum. Suitable for business applications, and light gaming Civ series as specified Memory has changed a bit.  Note:  Single DDR3 16GB DIMMS exist, but they are expensive....and single DDR3 32GB DIMMS are ludicrous.  Changed HDD to a 3TB for storage, and added a 120Gb SSD for use as the OS drive.
NZKshatriya didn't spec out your machine for today but instead projected the machine to last you at least 4-5 years.  Quad core is a minimum, 8 core would be best. My desktop runs an 8 core processor.  As far as the video card, yes, that's about right. Nothing extravagant but that will get the job done for any display you wish to push to. Furthermore, I cannot recommend DVI cables. Seen FAR too many of them just fail and require replacement. HDMI or DisplayPort would be ideal.  The only thing I would change from his build would be the hard drive. An SSD is now my standard for every machine I get due to such a fast reduction in start up times and speed of operation. I'm seeing 400-500GB SSD's for less than $130.  As a business, you should have an external storage arrary for data retention and only keep a year or less of data on your local to reference.
I'd actually consider a good business-centred PC - We run the small form factor versions of the HP Elitedesk 800s at work, though I personally am biased towards a full desktop formfactor. Thinkstations are the lenovo equivalent and dell probably has one too. Avoid consumer models - they're uniformly crap.  There's a few nice things about this. When its under warranty, they'll handle it for you. I'd personally consider getting the processor I want with a baseline amount of ram, and upgrade the storage (to an SSD) and ram (to the max it would handle) myself but weight the minor amount of work vs getting someone to do it for you.
There is an Australian company called Sonder that is putting in the marked a keyboard based on e-ink keys (the same display technolgy used on e-readers), it is in pre-order for 199$ and you can find it here: https://sonderdesign.com/product/sonder-keyboard/  Seems also that Apple is interested in this type of technology. Apple reportedly plans to ship the keyboards in its computers beginning in 2018.  More info here: http://arstechnica.com/apple/2016/10/report-apple-is-working-on-e-ink-keyboard-for-future-macbooks/
It is not completely true to say that there are no DSL modems supported by openwrt. Though some are definitely harder to flash with OpenWRT than others, requiring custom JTAG connections and opening up the router.  The Buffalo WBMR-HP-G300H will work with OpenWRT and support both annex a and b with ADSL 2+ (though NOT VDSL). However you need to upgrade via DD-WRT because of the way buffalo enforces encrypted images out of the box.  On the plus side, you don't need to open up the unit.  See: https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/wbmr-hp-g300h
As far as boards with 10x SATA III 6GBps, I would go with this board:  EVGA X99 Micro2  Reasoning:   Built in m.2 support, ideal for an OS drive, leaving all SATA devices open for other uses. DDR4 as opposed to older DDR3 i7 support 3 year warranty should issues with the board arise.
This GTX960 seems to meet your needs. 3 display ports, and with this one or any OpenCL API, it meets your other criteria. Under $200 also meets your "As cheap as possible" criteria.    Now, like others have said, most newer cards are going to meet your criteria, and using PCpartpicker you can select cards that have 3 display ports. So if my suggestion doesn't fit your bill, you should be able to find what you're looking for fairly quick.
Here's my recommendation. Meet's all your specs and runs fast. I have a 7450 which I'm very pleased with and runs my ruby code VM's along with dual monitors and wireless gaming every now and again. The 7470 is a step up from that.  Dell Latitude E7450 6th Gen i7 vPro 14" screen 512GB SSD 16GB RAM 2 USB 3.0 ports Optional 4 cell battery for 8hr+ battery life 3lbs $2100-ish http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/print_summary_details_popup.aspx?~lt=print&c=us&cs=04&fb=1&l=en&model_id=latitude-e7470-ultrabook&oc=cto05le747014us&s=bsd&vw=classic&leadtime=11/7/2016&showleadtime=True
Here's a link with some good charts for identifying which SSD has better 4k random read/writes.  http://www.anandtech.com/show/8216/samsung-ssd-850-pro-128gb-256gb-1tb-review-enter-the-3d-era/10  It looks like the Samsung SSD 850 Pro would be your best bet at 106 MB. The same brand/model just with 512GB of storage instead is at 103 Mb.  Doing dev work with files just 4kb in size is really not a fair test. Sure, not alot of files are 1MB but there are TONS of 100kb files and more. The 128kb file testing may be a better performance measure for you. However, at that testing level it may be that you are just splitting hairs.  I use my SSD for Ruby on Rails dev work along with HTML5 dev and some online code editors as well running on RAID arrays and found not much difference locally.

The only thing that I can find that comes close to your specifications is this: MSI 14.0" GS43VR   14" screen 16GB DDR4 (expandable) Internal m.2 SSD (base of 128GB, can be upgraded to desired size) Internal 2.5" SATA III (can be upgraded)   The easiest thing I can think of for the keyboard situation, is to just get a normal desktop keyboard and type with that.  First reason:  Your system WANTS compared to what is available in reality, is not jiving. Second reason....there are keyboards that can be customized beyond that of built in keyboards on the market.  As far as the battery life, that is something that hardly ever lives up to even the manufacturer ratings.  Just like rated MPGs on cars, it all depends on the system use.    I came as close as I could find to a specs matching system.  You may like the recommendation, then again you may not.  I know it does not fully match your specs.
I found something! After looking for a few months, I came across this press release for the Aten 2-Port USB DisplayPort KVM Switch that specifically mentions support for displayport resolutions up to 4096x2160 @60Hz.  I found it for sale on newegg and Amazon, and it looks like it's been out for while, but both sites only listed support for UHD resolution (3840x2160). I got it, plugged it in, and it worked great! Full resolution and refresh rate on both my computers.
I've had great success with a Dymo Labelwriter 450 Turbo. I use it to generate shipping labels, inventory labels, and name tags (with pictures) most often. I've used it for prototyping a few things as well.    The 450 supports a large variety of label sizes. I am not seeing one that is exactly 2.5x3.5, but there are a number that are close and are both adhesive and nonadhesive.  The 450 comes with software from Dymo that is used to create labels. It's not difficult to work with. The software does make generating certain things - like barcodes (but it doesn't sound like you need those) - very easy. You just need to tie a barcode field to a label field and the barcode generates for you automatically.   Printing a label can be done programmatically too. To do this, you need to create the label template. Then utilize the SDK to pass data to your label.   You can buy the printer from Dymo directly for less than $150. Labels vary in price depending on the size and type of labels you want. I recommend that you look through the label sizes and make sure you can find a size you are happy with, before going with the printer. Assuming that you can find the label size that you want, this is an excellent label maker.    An image of the label printed was requested. First, this is the label that was created as seen in the label software. This has two images - one a picture of the image above, the other a picture of the up/down vote arrows with a circle and arrow in red. There is a label (Tracking Num:), there is a field with a value (1234567890) and there are two barcodes. The standard UPC barcode (code 39) is auto-generated from the field with a value. The other is a QR code with a link back to this answer.     When printed, it looks like the example below. Notice that it is in black and white - so we miss out on the amazing red I added to the label. It is also a bit grainy, but I believe this is to be expected. It's not a picture printer.
NZKshatriya is correct - the price you're asking for is a little unrealistic for the system you want. However, if we go looking outside that range a way, there are plenty of systems you could have instead.  The Acer Aspire series has served me well, in particular the Acer Aspire E1-570:   (+) 1366x768 screen resolution (+) Will happily decode 1080/60 video (+) 1 Ethernet port (-) Only supports 802.11 b/g/n WiFi; not ac. (0) Definitely under 2" thick; not sure about 1" (0) 500 GB hard drive (+) 5+ hours battery life (+) 2x USB 2.0 and 1x USB 3.0 ports (+) 15.6" screen (+) Speaker and microphone; microphone range isn't great but quality is.   also:   4 GB RAM, upgradable to 8 GB (DDR3) SD card reader built-in   I bought mine for around Â£300, which would have been $450 then but is $369 now.
If you have not upgraded: I would recommend the MSI GeForce GTX 1060 DirectX 12  3GB 192-Bit GDDR5 Core Clock 1544 MHz Boost Clock 1759 MHz 1 x DL-DVI-D 1 x HDMI 2.0 1 x DisplayPort 1.4 PCI Express 3.0 x16   Some Futuremark stats for both cards:   HD 7850 GeForce GTX 1060-3GB   Anandtec review of the GTX 1060-3GB  Note, the anandtec review shows the EVGA card, but the MSI is the same chip.
Just to update this with new products: 4TB 5400RPM Seagate 2.5"  All for $193.04  This drive offers the highest capacity for the form factor so far. While not as fast as a 7200RPM drive, if you are looking for mass storage, this will do well. Consider a small external enclosure with multiples of these for a media server.  As the original question does not state what purpose the drive is needed for, I feel this drive would be great for general use.
I would recommend the Acer VN7-592G-77LB  GeForce GTX 960M 4 GB Intel Core i7 6700HQ (2.60 GHz) 16 GB Memory 1 TB HDD 256 GB SSD 15.6" IPS FHD 1920 x 1080 15.35" x 10.35" x 0.90" 5.07 lbs. Windows 10 Home 64-Bit LED-backlit IPS display   Cannot find any stats on battery life however.  Another option would be:  Lenovo IdeaPad Y700 80NV00Q9US  GeForce GTX 960M 4 GB Quad Core Intel Core i7 6700HQ (2.60 GHz)  16 GB DDR4 Memory 1 TB HDD 256 GB PCIE SSD  15.6" Full HD 1920 x 1080  External DVD+-R/RW   Again, no information on battery life found.
Razer's "ultra-low-profile mechanical keyboard" (I don't see any model name) is the mechanical keyboard with the shortest travel distance I am aware of (without having to add o-rings). Unfortunately, the actuation force is high: 65g to the actuation point, 70g to bottom. It was announced on Thursday, 14 July 2016. The announced price is U.S. $169.99 / EU â‚¬189.99.
As far as something not too garish, and can be configured to meet your specifications, I would suggest the Sager NP3673   6th Gen IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7-6700HQ Processor 17.3" Full HD Matte Display Intel HD Graphics 530 8GB DDR4 at 2400MHz upgradable 1TB 7200rpm SATA2 HDD upgradable 8X DVDÂ±R/RW/4X +DL Super-Multi Drive Intel Wireless-AC 3165 + Bluetooth upgradable White-LED illuminated keyboard WindowsÂ® 10 Home 64-Bit Edition upgradable   There are a lot of customization options through Sager's online store, such as options for an m.2 drive for your OS or extra storage.
First of all, I'm assuming you're only interested in upgrading your GPU and not other hardware components. If you are interested in upgrading, please leave a comment and I can update my answer.  All percentages are taken from userbenchmark.com  Now, for ~$500 you can get a couple of things:    nVidia  $600: GTX 1080 - 6x better than your current GPU  $400: GTX 1070 - 4.5x better than your current GPU  $200: GTX 1060 - 3x better than your current GPU    AMD  $220: RX 480 - 3x better    My recommendation is the GTX 1070 if you're not interested in upgrading other parts of your computer. Otherwise, you should probably purchase a new motherboard and CPU and simply get a GTX 1060, which is still a major upgrade.  I especially recommend this as I suspect that in some games your limited CPU will severely bottleneck the ridiculously powerful GTX 1070.  Also, the GTX 1060 will max out most games at ultra at 1920x1080p anyway, so unless you have a 144hz monitor or one of a resolution of 2560x1440p or higher there's not much point in purchasing a powerful GPU before you get all your other hardware up to date.
What about a GTX 1070 laptop?  Sager NP8153:  Specs:   CPU: i7-6700HQ (much more powerful than Alienware) RAM: 8GB DDR4 (same as Alienware) Disk: 1TB (same as Alienware) Wireless: 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth (same as Alienware) GPU: GTX 1070 (much, much more powerful than Alienware) Backlit keyboard (Alienware has none) Gears of War 4 - free! (Alienware has none) Monitor: 15.6" 1920x1080p IPS G-Sync (Alienware doesn't have G-Sync)   Conclusion  Never used a Sager laptop before, not associated with them, but looked up a couple of random yet reputable brands to come across this. It's better than Alienware, so buy it instead?
So what you are after is an internet bonding device. Here is a great blog post about it, with video.  You will have to talk to your ISP to see about acquiring a bonding device, because they will be splitting all traffic to/from you house into 2 separate pipes. It's quite interesting how it works, and according to linus tech tips it works almost flawlessly when the ISP is involved.  The solution above will work with the two fiber connections, not with the 3g/4g connection.   There are software solutions that will let you blend multiple speeds from multiple providers, however none of them will actually give you the speed increase you a looking for.   This ZyXel router Supports duel wan connections, allowing you to prioritize your traffic. This would allow you to have certain people on a certain connection... but it does not actually bond the speeds  together giving you any actual speed increase. It just gives you better performance over a larger set of people. Also provides fail safe in case one ISP is going through an outage. Actual bonding, where traffic is split between two separate pipes and reassembled in you home is done at the ISP level.
First one, HP Pavilion 23-q105n, is out immediately. A desktop with an integrated graphics card? I looked at the Intel 530 graphics card and it gets 1 star. For doing photoshop work, that's terrible. Plus, you'll need more RAM across the board.  http://www.futuremark.com/hardware/gpu/Intel+HD+Graphics+530/review  The 27-n230na is looking better, but a regular HDD isn't going to cut it for you in the next few years. See if an SSD is an option for the machines and give specs on the speed rating for the processors. Especially with the HDD speed being so low at 5400RPM, this is a massive damper to pretty much everything you'll be doing on it.  Here is a chart showing SSD vs 7200RPM drive. Your load time for Photoshop would be longer than this, probably be around 30 seconds...JUST for the program to load.  http://www.laptopmag.com/images/wp/purch-api/incontent/2012/03/geeks-geek-app-open.jpg  Furthermore, it appears the HP machines use mobile graphics processors.  Also when using a computer for dev work, an SSD with 16GB+ of RAM (especially in a desktop) would greatly aid a reduction in code compiling and testing time which is the longest portion and most intensive memory functionality of coding.  See if the Lenovo can be configured with an SSD and then you'll be all set with that machine for the next few years.
At work, in my lab, I am using a programmable USB hub from Acroname (https://acroname.com/store/s77-usbhub-2x4?sku=S77-USBHUB-2X4). If you have this attached to your server, you can reach through (remotely) and have the hub disable/enable any port on it's output. Pretty elegant and has saved me a bunch of time and space.  I think they have a USB 3.0 hub out now too.

A liquid cooled desktop would be your best bet IMHO. A smaller case can be had with liquid cooling and configurations can be made to route liquid cooling to the graphics card(s).  A library whisper at 6' registers at 30dB. Here is a cooler which runs at 14dB https://pcpartpicker.com/product/xkYXsY/arctic-cooling-cpu-cooler-ucacoap111gbb01  Project out to run 32GB of RAM if it is in your budget but 16GB should be your minimum.  And here is a case fan which runs around 13dB. https://pcpartpicker.com/product/MsL7YJ/prolimatech-case-fan-ultrasleekvortex12white  And here's a list of liquid cooling systems for desktops. http://www.newegg.com/Water-Liquid-Cooling/SubCategory/ID-575  Not knowing your budget is hard when so many objects exist.
I would suggest either of these:     OriginPC.com Chronos Falcon Northwest - Tiki   Both can be fully customized, have options for water cooling, and are made by companies that have years of experience in custom systems.
I personally have the Ducky Zero with brown switches and the build quality is very solid. It does not have any fancy features (the only one i really miss is start/stop buttons for media players), but apart from that it is very good.  The price should be around 100 â‚¬ - in any case less than your maximum amount.
Check out this guide and also mechanical keyboard reseller spreadsheet for UK, it has most keyboards available in the UK with their respective prices and where to get them.

I've been able to make a "identical" build, that matches the specs you mentioned. Here's the link to the PC part picker. Everything is off Amazon.com  CPU: AMD A10-7800 3.5GHz Quad-Core Processor  ($123.00 @ Amazon)   Motherboard: MSI A68HM-E33 V2 Micro ATX FM2+ Motherboard  ($49.99 @ Amazon)  Memory: Kingston 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory  ($41.55 @ Amazon)   Storage: Seagate Barracuda 1TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive  ($47.99 @ Amazon)   Case: Rosewill FBM-02 MicroATX Mini Tower Case  ($28.91 @ Amazon)   Power Supply: CoolMax 400W ATX Power Supply  ($23.22 @ Amazon)   Other: Windows 10 Home 64 Bit OEM DVD ENGLISH  ($75.99 @ Amazon)   Total: $390.65  Prices include shipping, taxes, and discounts when available.
As for another option, here's a build using an Intel CPU. Personally, I'm not a big fan of AMD CPUs, I haven't had a good experience with them. Here's the link to the PC part picker list. Again, everthing's off Amazon. I'd personally go with this Intel build over the AMD build I mentioned. The i3 6100 has a benchmark that is slightly above/better than the AMD A10 7800. Regardless, both these builds should do what you need.

If you need that kind of performance at a lower price, you could try these:   $20 Orange Pi PC 2: http://www.orangepi.org/orangepipc2/ $19 Pine A64+ 1GB: https://www.pine64.org/?product=pine-a64-board-1gb   The Pine A64+ is quite a bit larger than the RPi though, I would say that it has roughly twice the surface area. Both boards have the added advantage of gigabit ethernet.
Every battery case I've seen (for phones with non-removable batteries) occupies the port. Meaning that you can't use it for other interfaces. So that seems like an unlikely solution (not to say it isn't possible or doesn't exist). I realize this doesn't exactly match the criteria presented by the question, but please bear with me. What if you used a USB C Multiport Adapter? Along with a Male USB 3.0 to Female USB 3.1 adapter. Apple's verison seems the most reputable (all the other manufacturers selling something similar on Amazon are companies I've never heard of). If it works with USB C on a MacBook, then why shouldn't it work on a phone? All USB ports must meet a certain standard.  --  In Conclusion, You Could Do This:  Connect phone to multiport adapter. Connected to the multiport adapter is  a USB 3.0 to USB C adapter (for connecting to your drone controller) Connected to the USB C on the multiport adapter is a phone charger of somesort.  --  Can someone verify that this does work? It seems like it would work to me, considering the fact that the USB interface is standardized. Thanks!
The search is over. After much deliberation, I ended up going with the Logitech G610 Orion Brown. The Corsair Strafe was a good keyboard and had nice red backlighting but the keys seemed to jut out a little more than the Logitech one.   Additionally I know that Logitech make good keyboards so I can relax knowing that Logitech is brand that I can trust.   If anyone is interested I will write back with my opinion in terms of what my experience was like using it.   edit: Thanks to everyone for their help and suggestions.
I'd go for Audioengine's A2+. They are extremely versatile desktop speakers with a 2.0 powered system that produces excellent quality audio, even without a subwoofer. Youâ€™ll pay between $200 and $300 for the A2+, which is definitely a bargain for top-end speakers. Full review - http://soundgenetics.com/best-computer-speakers/  Full disclosure: I am the author of the linked blog post.
There is no such thing as "850 Evo Pro" it's either EVO or PRO. IN any case go for the Pro versions. I have lots of SSDs here, among them also the 850 Pro and the Kingston HyperX Predator 240GB PCIe.  If you do have a M.2 NVMe capable slot, then there's no question: go for that. SATA is really not suitable for modern SSDs anymore(the numbers you see with the 850 Pro are SATA maxed out).  So in terms of speed and shorter boot times, The Kingston is definitely it.  Nowadays there are some even better M.2 NVMe SSDs and you may want to consider if these are or are not within your budget. The performance hierarchy is   Samsung 850 Pro < Kingston HyerX < Samsung 950 Pro < Samsung 960 Pro  I have the Samsung 950 Pro in my notebook and it gives around 2.5 GB/s read and 1.1 GB/s write. As this is what Samsung announces, I tend to believe that the 960 Pro will deliver the 3.5GB/s read and 2.1 GB/s write although I haven't tested it personally yet.
For a system that is preconfigured with those specs, you are looking at a bit higher of a price range.  The lowest I could find via Newegg was an HP Envy for around $1700 USD.  I feel your best bet, would be to look at companies that build customized systems.  One such place is XoticPC.  I'd look at customizing either of the following, to stay close to budget:   MSI GP62 Leopard Pro-870 ASUS GL552VW-DH71
I'd recommend the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO. It has 4 direct contact heat pipes and is rated for 180W thermal dissipation. And goes for about Â£30. You can also buy some clips and convert it to push-pull rather than just push.  The dimensions are (H,W,L) 158.5mm x 120mm x 77mm (1 fan) or ~100mm (2 fans).
Edit: 11/14/16   How about something like this? Sony HT-XT3  This is actually a soundbase, which sits under the TV....but it does fit the rest of the specs as far as width....Finding a match for your specifications, is being tedious lol.  Here is a review if it helps
I'm seeing a lot of discussion about liquid cooling despite the fact that liquid cooling solutions nearly always include fans (noise). I believe what you would be interested in is passive cooling whereby no fans are used whatsoever. The keyword "passive" should help you in your search for 100% silent operation.  Unfortunately unless this machine practically idle 100% of the time you will need some active cooling or else cumulatively your case will act as an oven. I might suggest using an NH-D15 without any fans on it for the CPU. Invest in some BeQuiet Silent Wings for the case (if your case has a lot of vent holes 1 should be enough, otherwise get 2) as they are remarkably quiet.  This is, of course, not an off-the-shelf solution but is easily a one-hour job for anyone with the most basic knowledge of computer components and screwdrivers.
Well, there is an argument to be made here:  Which is more important, low cost, or low capacity?   I would suggest this:  THZY 512M USB  Simply based on low price this would work.  Capacity is 512MB, so not overboard.
1. Network switch TAP port  On a switch, the read-only port is often called a "TAP" port...    https://observer.viavisolutions.com/includes/popups/taps/tap-vs-span.php  ...although different vendors have different names.   This will pass you all the data that goes bettwen the two devices, but the switch essentially reads the incomming packets and then retransmitts them out the TAP port, so the data is buffered and error checked by the switch. You may not see some kinds of packets (like runts or bad CRC), and the timing of the packets will be altered because of the buffering.  2. Dedicated tap hardware  These are expensive, but typically give you lower level access to the data. This is good if, say, you need exact timestamps for the packets which are not available on a switch TAP port becuase the packets are buffered.     http://datacomsystems.com/products/network-taps  3. Passive hardware tap  If you can get both devices to run at 10Base-T speeds, you can use a passive tap like this one...   http://hackerwarehouse.com/product/lan-tap-pro/?gclid=COGQ7Y3yqtACFdRMDQodYH4CKg  They are also not hard to make yourself if you have the right tools. A passive tap can show you even media level problems which don't usually show up on the higher level taps.

With that kind of budget, you can get just about anything you like. I've put together a build which should run everything you want to do and more just fine.  PCPartPicker part list: http://pcpartpicker.com/list/zCm66X Price breakdown by merchant: http://pcpartpicker.com/list/zCm66X/by_merchant/   CPU: Intel Core i7-6700K 4.0GHz Quad-Core Processor  ($328.99 @ SuperBiiz)  CPU Cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO 82.9 CFM Sleeve Bearing CPU Cooler  ($24.88 @ OutletPC)  Motherboard: Asus Z170-A ATX LGA1151 Motherboard  ($144.99 @ B&H)  Memory: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-2133 Memory  ($77.99 @ Newegg)  Storage: Samsung 850 EVO-Series 500GB 2.5" Solid State Drive  ($164.99 @ B&H)  Video Card: MSI GeForce GTX 1060 6GB 6GB GAMING X Video Card  ($272.99 @ B&H)  Case: NZXT S340 (Black/Red) ATX Mid Tower Case  ($66.99 @ SuperBiiz)  Power Supply: EVGA 500W 80+ Bronze Certified ATX Power Supply  ($42.39 @ OutletPC)  Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10 Home OEM 64-bit  ($82.00 @ Amazon)  Wireless Network Adapter: Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I PCI-Express x1 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Adapter  ($29.79 @ OutletPC)    Total: $1236.00  Simplified to the important bits, that becomes:   i7-6700K 4.0GHz 16 GB DDR4 RAM 1x GTX 1060 6GB GPU 500 GB SSD   Some notes:   I've included Windows 10 Home in the list, because I don't know if you already have it. If you do, you can remove it and get the build for $82 cheaper. As Adam says, you should also consider Ubuntu, especially given that it's free. I've gone for just one GPU. With the kind of power you get out of the GTX 10-series GPU's, and with the kind of work you're doing, you really only need one - the only reason to get two is for bragging rights. I've included a wireless adapter. That was important for me when I built my PC, because the nearest RJ45 connection was 20m away. If you can be sure you'll be wired all the time, you can exclude this. There's room both in the build and in your budget to upgrade. You could up it to 32 GB RAM if you wanted (it's not necessary for your usage, but it's possible), or you could add another disk.
I've run a beebox at 4k before. I used the N3150 based model which has a fan, though it hardly kicks in in normal use. Runs most common linux distros fine.  You'll probably want to run it with paired memory (I run it with 2x 4gb sticks). I have the 'windows' model (Moved the ram it came with elsewhere), but the regular model does one MSATA and one 2.5 inch drives, with the windows model adding a emmc to the mix.    Cheap, silent and about as unobtrusive as it gets. You might be able to get some similar machine from other manufacturers, but the beebox has a pretty unique feature list - low power processor, optional fan and dual channel ram.
A slightly more studied build, for a little bit more.  CPU: Intel Core i7-5930K 3.5GHz 6-Core Processor  ($570.99 @ B&H)   CPU Cooler: Deepcool GAMMAXX 400 74.3 CFM CPU Cooler  ($14.99 @ Newegg)  Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-X99P-SLI ATX LGA2011-3 Motherboard  ($193.98 @ Newegg)   Memory: Avexir Core Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-2400 Memory  ($69.99 @ Newegg)  Memory: Avexir Core Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-2400 Memory  ($69.99 @ Newegg)  Storage: ADATA Premier Pro SP900 64GB 2.5" Solid State Drive  ($38.99 @ Amazon)   Storage: Intel 600p Series 512GB M.2-2280 Solid State Drive  ($168.50 @ Amazon)   Video Card: Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1070 8GB Windforce OC Video Card  ($379.99 @ B&H)   Case: Thermaltake Commander G41 ATX Mid Tower Case  ($34.99 @ Newegg)   Power Supply: EVGA 850W 80+ Gold Certified Semi-Modular ATX Power Supply  ($69.99 @ Newegg)   Case Fan: LEPA Vortex 12 PWM 63.9 CFM  120mm Fan  ($3.99 @ Newegg)  Case Fan: LEPA Vortex 12 PWM 63.9 CFM  120mm Fan  ($3.99 @ Newegg)   Case Fan: LEPA Vortex 12 PWM 63.9 CFM  120mm Fan  ($3.99 @ Newegg)   Other: Ubuntu Studio 64 Bit ($0.00)  Total: $1624.37  A few points about this build I'd like to touch on:   Ubuntu over Windows: unless another part of your workflow requires windows, benchmarks show Blender performs much better in Linux, so that should be your first choice of OS. It will also be less of a leap to go from Mac to Linux, as you'll be sticking to UNIX-like environments. This motherboard was specifically selected for the way it evenly spaces its four 16x PCI-E slots; this will make adding up to four full size GPUs easy in the future. The large PSU was selected to allow easy GPU upgrades in the future - smaller PSUs may not properly power multiple fullsize GPUs, and worse - may not have the necessary cabling. The hexacore CPU will outperform newer quadcore CPUs in programs like Blender. This one also has a few more PCI-E lanes for additional GPU installations down the road; while the motherboard PCH should eliminate that problem for most such configurations, it's always nice to know you're building to spec, to eliminate compatibility issues and minor drops in performance. The M.2 PCI-E 3.0 drive offers double the I/O of SATA III SSDs; use this for storing and working with your projects. The regular 64gb SATA III SSD is for your OS and programs. Adding more and faster RAM will yield dividends in Blender builds - not only will faster RAM complete your work faster for only a nominal price increase, but having more RAM than your program needs can free up your remaining memory to create the fastest storage medium of all, a RAMDisk. This can be used to cache your writes and reads on all your disks, hugely improving storage I/O performance across the board at the cost of increased system startup and shutdown times. The fans aren't probably strictly necessary, though they might come in handy if you were to add a number of GPUs.
Here's what I'd Do: This build is similar to the build I use personally however, it has been modified to fit your requirements... I've kept all the parts from one online store (amazon.com) to help simplify the ordering process. Also, Amazon tends to send orders in one package.    Build Notes:    i7 6700k has reasonable "overclockability" for additional performance when needed. e.g. when using CPU for rendering with cycles. The Thermaltake NiC C5 is rated for 230W TDP, personally, I have been able to render with the i7 6700k @ 4.8GHz under load. GTX 1080 (2 way SLI if you want to or separate): CUDA can also be used for rendering with cycles. They are overclockable with MSi Afterburner (again, for more performance while rendering). When using 2 GPUs, 2 tiles will be rendering simultaneously (1 tile per GPU). Having 2 GTX 1080s rather than one should come close to halving your rendering time. (the cards can't be in SLI when you want to utilize 2 rendering tiles) Motherboard supports CPU and GPU overclocking (includes SLI bridge) There's still a sizeable chunk of budget left for upgrades (more ram, additional disks etc...)     CPU: Intel Core i7-6700K 4.0GHz Quad-Core Processor  ($337.00 @ Amazon)   CPU Cooler: Thermaltake NiC C5 99.1 CFM CPU Cooler  ($58.34 @ Amazon)   Motherboard: MSI Z170A SLI PLUS ATX LGA1151 Motherboard  ($132.90 @ Amazon)   Memory: Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB (4 x 8GB) DDR4-2133 Memory  ($181.77 @ Amazon)  Storage: Samsung 850 Pro Series 256GB 2.5" Solid State Drive  ($128.14 @ Amazon)   Storage: Seagate Barracuda 2TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive  ($72.99 @ Amazon)   Video Card: EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 8GB Founders Edition Video Card (2-Way SLI) ($709.14 @ Amazon)   Video Card: EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 8GB Founders Edition Video Card (2-Way SLI)  ($709.14 @ Amazon) (Access to the dual GPU bandwagon)  Optical Drive: Asus DRW-24F1ST DVD/CD Writer  ($17.75 @ Amazon)   Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10 Home OEM 64-bit  ($87.81 @ Amazon)  Case Fan: Corsair CO-9050016-BLED 52.2 CFM  120mm Fans  ($24.49 @ Amazon) (It's a 2 pack)  PSU: Sentey XPP725-HS Xplus Power Supply 725w Pc Computer ATX Desktop Power Supply ($42.99 @ Amazon)   Case: Thermaltake Versa H22 Window CA-1B3-00M1WN-00 Mid-tower Computer Chassis (Black)  ($43.55 @ Amazon)   Total: $2603.01
This one looks like it meets your requirements in terms of size and dialog volume: https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/speakers/home_theater/bose-solo-5-tv-sound-system.html   Has mounting brackets Has "Dialogue mode to hear each word and detail clearly" Has Optical audio input (digital) Is < 30" (21.6")
http://www.keyboardco.com/keyboard/cleankeys-glass-easy-clean-medical-wireless-keyboard.asp  Expensive, but:   Zero travel Almost zero force As a bonus, easy to clean (which is what it's marketed for) Last but not least, it has the very important feature of actually being available for sale
I've seen people use that board so it does work. I don't have any experience with it so I can't tell you how "plug-and-play" it is.  Your motherboard and your processor don't match though, so you will be unable to use that hardware together.
I have a starter basic PC Build am working on that might help get you started. The idea is for performance, gaming, and game development, etc. If you upscale the power supply with a graphics card in SLI, that should be suitable to your rendering and baking needs.   First PC Build  I took the liberty of posting the hardware requirements for such a PC,   Here are the production hardware requirements from Wikipedia:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)  64-bit eight core CPU  16 GB RAM  Dual OpenGL 3.2 compatible cards with 4 GB video RAM  Dual 1920Ã—1080 pixels, 24-bit color  Three-button mouse and graphics tablet
This one is under budget, and meets all of your other criteria. Seems like a solid little piece of hardware, I might pick one up...    It sounds like your travelling alot. I would consider getting a small bit of projector cloth and 4 push pins. I doubt hotel staff would see the pin holes, and it would make your experience with any projector better. You can cut the cloth down to the size you'd prefer, or just let the remainder hang loose. When your done, it should fold up nicely and go back into your bag.    Crenova Mini Projector
Yes.  You can use two SODIMMS of different capacity.   Case in point, my MSI GL62 shipped with 12GB of ram, an 8GB and a 4GB SODIMM.  The same goes for a Desktop with full length DIMMS.
You didn't specify operating system, but the LG Extravert 2 meets all requirements.  Just take the SIM card out.  Has camera.  Has SD Card for exporting data.  Has Qwerty keyboard.  Is small.  Is less than $100.  Is not no name Chinese.  Has an app for notes. Is PIN protected. Not sure about encryption,  but there's probably an Android app for that.
You have a couple questions in there which may warrant more than one post across multiple SE sites. I'll throw in my experience on the curved display part.  I currently use a Dell U3415W, a 34'' curved 60hz 21:9 3440x1440 monitor. It has the more gentle curve (3800r IIRC) than something like the BenQ 3501 (2000r, lower = more extreme curve = more strict viewing position).  From my experience the curve has much more of a "....wow!" factor than any sort of practical use however this is likely compounded by just how giant my monitor is. I wouldn't say my workflow has improved necessarily any more than it would if I had gotten a flat-screened monitor, but moving from a pair of 27'' 1080p screens (thus eliminating the bezel gap) and adding pixels has absolutely helped. The window management software is very usable and doesn't really get in the way.  I'd be careful about getting a curved display if your design work is anything more than casual as the curve is literally a distortion of the image (albeit minor) and may not reflect the true image with 100% precision.   Having triple monitors means you'll need to consider both the number of video outputs on your machine as well as its ability to push the pixels. If you aren't doing anything intense the second point is pretty much null on any processor/gpu. Once you start running games or high res photo/video projects you need to consider how many pixels are really in front of you (1080p = 2,073,600 pixels. 3x 1080p = 6,220,800, 4k = 8,294,400) and at what refresh rate (60hz, 144hz). Horsepower on GPUs/APUs starts to dwindle quickly when you're throwing high resolutions at high framerates.
The answer to your question can be opinion based and I am not going to take that road. Hovewer I'll argue, that it is worth buying newer hardware for 'future-proofing' like: DDR4 support, Microsoft presumably says it's dropping Windows 10 support for older hardware than Skylake (source).   On the other hand, the 200 Euro deal you describe is indeed profitable, and the hardware will serve your purpose for years to come (especially when paired with 1080).  The choice is still up to you though.
My favourite by far is the mbeat 7 port hub.   4xUSB_3.0 + 3xUSB_2.0 - actually the USB 2's are really handy for incompatible Logitech gear. Individual switches Dull LEDs on the top that can be covered. Good throughput - see my wiring layout below. NOT compact, but its flat, with all ports along the one side - so its good to attach to the back of the table and use as a permanent dock/expansion.   I use the AC adapter, but I just tested it without (I even plugged in an extra USB3-stick to see if I could trip it, and its fine).  Here's my usage to give you an idea of continual bandwith.     7_U3 > USB3 AV breakout box with HDMI, DVI, Analog audio used.    6_U3 > USB3 HDD (powered, WD3TB).    5_U3 > Spare (for USB-sticks and the likes).    4_U3 > Micro-USB lead for fast-charging my devices.    3_U2 > Multi-charger lead for random devices that come across my desk.    2_U2 > Logi G100 Keyboard     1_U2 > Logi M100 Mouse   So I use the toggles a lot for disconnecting the HDD or stop charging devices, or to temporarily disconnect phones etc that I am testing.
You should seriously consider the newer chip for rendering. I shall weigh up the + / - as if we refer to upgrading to the newer CPU.  - It has been shown on TOM's hardware many times that there is little difference for gaming, due to the CPU clock-speed being a big factor in games still. Consider this a small minus as CPU has VERY little effect on game performance (it's all about GPU, baby!)  - You will need to buy new RAM as you stated, and it's not really much better in performance for games... Video it is, but only a little bit.  + Power usage / thermal control is a LOT better on the 6000's, so it will distract your gaming a lot less with quieter fans.  + Video encoding MUCH faster on the new i7's if the software is optimised for it (it will be).  + (this is the one that got me) Upgrading Mobo means you get all the sweet new features such as USB3.1 and type-C connectors. Future-you will thank you for this investment.  Also, EUR200 is too much for that old CPU. I mean, performance-per-dollar it's OK, but if you really look hard for second-hand machines you will find one (probably with case and PSU) for half that price.
Changing the CPU is not as easy as adding RAM or swapping a HDD.  It is a FULL dissasembly.  Have a look at this video here.  Still want to do it, then narrow your list of possible options. We can use the Intel ARK to get a list of processors that will fit in your laptop. Looks like the Intel i3-330M is the cheapest processor which supports VT-x and isn't a downgrade.    Are you sure you want to take the effort to swap one five-year-old processor for another?  I have a feeling you could get a used laptop with VT-x enabled almost as cheap as buying a core and replacing it.
While I can't judge on the given SSD model, I can issue a recommendation for another one.  The Samsung 850 EVO 500GB SSD.  Here's why it's a good SSD:   Price. It's 130USD on Amazon right now and thus just as expensive as the SSD you linked. Speed. The 850 Evo will go to 400MB/s no problem. Anything beyond that will depend on your system but probably won't make noticeable differences in practice. Durability / Warranty. Samsung gives you a 5-year / 150TBW warranty on this SSD, meaning Samsung guarantees that your SSD will still work perfectly fine if you use it for less than 5 years and write less than 150TB (300 complete writes over the drive or 84GB / day) during that time-span. Chances are this SSD won't fail you even if you go beyond the 150TBW limit. In fact, even the less-durable predecessor with half the storage (for which Samsung only gives you three years of warranty) survived 300TBW without major issues. It is thus expected that you can go at least up to 500 - 1000TBW without loosing the 850 EVO. If you want even more you need to put down the additional 90USD for a 850 PRO  which should survive a few PB worth of writes. Brand. Samsung flash storage has a very good reputation. Software. Samsung provides software for all its SSDs to optimize the system perfomance (stuff like enabling AHCI). The software also tells you how much data has already been written on your SSD.   As a non-exhaustive personal opinion: I have used this very SSD for more than 1 year now
You will need either the Yubikey 4 or Yubikey Neo in order to use the device to store passwords or authentication tokens. The $18 U2F key will only allow you to perform U2F logins on websites (and browsers) that support it. It is not designed as a password replacement.

Okay did not get much response here so I did 5 more days of research and this is what I came to.  Processor: i7-6800K    Reason: I decided due to the amount of multi-tasking I do that the extra cores were too enticing to pass up. Vendor: Microcenter - $329.00 Note: There was a sale so the processor was only $10 more   Cooler: Corsair Hydro H100i V2   Reason: I figured I would be tempted to overclock the 6700K so I justified the cost on both processors (another reason why I went with the 6800K) Vendor: Amazon - $99.99 (on sale)   Motherboard: ASRock X99 Taichi   Reasons: True quad channel MB, 8 DIM slots, dual NICs, builtiin Wi-Fi, dual M.2 ports, USB Type-C port, well-spaced PCIe ports Vendor: NewEgg - $199.99 - $20 Rebate + $0.99 Shipping = $181.98 (I could have saved another $30 with the combo at Microcenter but they did not have this board)    Ram: GSkill Ripjaws 4 DDR4 4x8GB 3000MHZ   Reasons: Ripjaws 4 was built specifically for Quad Channel vs Ripjaws 5 Etc / Good Value Vendor: NewEgg $199.99 - $20 Promo Code = $179.99   Video Card: Gigabyte GeForce GTX1060 GV-N1060G1GAMING-6GD   Reasons: Do you know how hard it is to find and verify that a video card will actually support 4 monitors? I do now. Besides that it seems like a decent card for my purposes. Vendor: Amazon - $274.99 - $20 rebate = $254.99   Storage: Plextor M8PE M.2 2280 512GB NVMe   Reasons: Super fast drive, almost as fast as Samsung 960 Pro for a lot less money. Samsung 960 Evo is not out yet (this would have been my preference). Side note: I really wanted the AIC version of this drive but I goofed around and it sold out. Other vendors were too expensive and now I will have to get heatsink recommendations for this from this forum Vendor: Newegg $249.99 - $25 Promo code = $224.99   PSU: Corsair CS Series CS750M 750W Gold   Reasons: Plenty of power and room for extra stuff, gold rated, semi-modular, ON SALE Vendor: Amazon - $79.99   Case: Undecided, but I am going to go down to Frys and get something locally.  Total Cost: $1350.93  This ended up being a very painful experience but I do feel like I got a really good system out of this. I really struggled with another issue as well and that is the fact that the i7-7700K Is coming out in a month and smashes this processor in benchmarks. In the end when that happens most likely I will give this computer to my wife and daughter and put myself through this misery again.    I hope this helps someone if they have this same struggle.
Your requirements sound similar to my home server, except that I went with an internal RAID-6 array -- so that's $400 in hot-swap bays, cases, and controller cards you won't need to spend.  At the cheaper end of the price range, buying pre-made usually costs less than building your own.  The mostly-preassembled option I'd recommend would be an Intel 2550L2D-MxPC for about $130.  It's got an Atom D2550 CPU (four years newer and considerably more powerful than my Atom 230), dual gigabit ethernet, two USB 3.0 and four USB 2.0 ports.  You'll need to add RAM ($45 for 8 GB) and a boot drive ($40 for either a 500GB hard drive or a 120GB SSD).  Like almost all of Intel's products, it's Linux-compatible.
After some consideration I am going with Plex layered on top of FreeNAS, and using a Chromecast for the HDMI head end and using the Plex/Chromcast App on my tablet to perform the control.
If you are just looking for something to get you up there is Pavlok.  This literally zaps you awake.  It has a lot of mixed reviews but some people swear by it. Company Website: www.pavlok.com / I recommend checking out the amazon reviews.  They are VERY VERY MIXED>  If you are looking for something that actually tracks your sleep cycle there is a product called sleep cycle that tracks your sleep through a monitor on your night stand.  Has tons of great reviews on Apple and Android platforms.  Itunes App & Reviews / Android App & Reviews / Company Website: www.sleepcycle.com  If you are dead set on a wearable you really do not have much choice out there.  While many of the wearable track your sleep. Ie Fitbit Jawbone Etc.  Most do not wake you up they just give you your sleep data.  After doing more research it seems as though the Jawbone Up2 /3 /4 all offer a "Smart Alarm" That will wake you up inside a 30 minute window https://jawbone.com/up/trackers
I would probably go with this one:  ASUS Z170-E  These points jump out, at least at me:  DDR4 memory overclocked to 3466MHz(max compatible speed)  Onboard USB 3.1 Gen 2 for 10Gbit/s data transfer speeds Lightning-fast M.2 with PCIe 3.0 x4 interface
This Audio A/B switch might be what you are looking for, because it provides exactly two inputs and one output as requested.   Since you plan to use it with standard 3.5" jacks, you will need these extra cables to connect the PC and smartphone jack sockets to the switch input sockets.  While those cables are required in your case, they are also useful to you, because they solve the problem of the PC providing a socket under the desk near the foot, because you can buy longer cables or jack extension cables.
tl;dr The Samsung KU6290 is a 40" 4K TV for around $300. It has HDMI 2.0, Chroma 4:4:4, input lag of around 35ms, and has been recommended on Amazon for use as a computer monitor. The 6290 is identical to the KU6300 except for the smart remote control.  I've been doing a ton of research on monitors, televisions and display technology. My goal was to purchase a larger display to use for the following tasks:   General computer use (web browsing, email, etc) Programming (mostly using the JetBrains IDEs and Visual Studio Word processing Gaming   Some of my other goals and constraints   Inexpensive (sub $500) Wall mountable   Initially, I was looking at 27" to 30" monitors, but I discovered that 4K/UHD/3840 Ã— 2160 (all three mean the same thing) medium sized monitors aren't really that useful for productivity, programming, and word processing. The idea is that these tasks are text-intensive, and a 4K resolution on a 27" monitor is going to produce text sizes and UI element sizes that are too small to see comfortably.  Instead, I started looking at a 4K television that I could use as a computer monitor. Based on reports from other people, and on my desk size, it seemed that 40" was about the right size. When looking for a 4K TV-as-monitor, I discovered that there are a few important factors:   Chroma 4-4-4: Chroma when used in reference to televisions refers to algorithms used to compress the RGB color signals. The more compression, the faster the signal can be transmitted and processed. This is fine for video or games, but when you start compressing colors, text can become blurry. Chroma 4-4-4 means that there is no compression. Most of the people I've spoken with have agreed that finding a tv that allows for 4-4-4 chroma is one of the most important factors when using a tv as a monitor.   Here is a much more detailed explanation of chroma and color compression   HDMI 2.0 input: There are two common HDMI standards, 1.4 and 2.0. Only 2.0 will support 4K @ 60Hz. 1.4 will maxes out at 4K @ 30Hz. The Hz refers to the refresh rate of the screen. For programming and general computer use, 30Hz may be fine for most people, but the difference between 30Hz and 60Hz when gaming is very noticeable. Many serious gamers use displays with a 120Hz refresh rate. The higher the rate, the less motion blur there is. This is especially important when the FPS of a game or video increases. In general, you won't notice a big quality difference from 60Hz to 120Hz unless your average FPS is also above 60. Unfortunately, for now, HDMI 2.0 doesn't support a 120Hz refresh rate at 4:4:4 Chroma, as the data bandwidth is too low. You would need either Display Port or USB 3.1 for this. Very few 4K TVs have a display port input, and I haven't found any that have a USB 3.1 video input.    Source on HDMI bandwidth.  Source on 4K @ 60Hz @ 4:4:4 Chroma not being possible   Input Lag: Measured in milliseconds, this is the amount of time it takes before change in the source data is reflected on the screen. This rating is mostly irrelevant for video playback, as once the video starts, the response time doesn't really matter. However, it is very relevant in a monitor for general use, programming, and video games. A high response time will produce a noticeable lag between a mouse movement (or controller movement) and the change on the screen. In competitive, fast paced games like Call of Duty, or DOTA, even a small improvement in input lag can improve a person's ability. As I'm not in the upper echelons of competitive gaming, this isn't a huge factor but is still important. Input lag is inversely correlated with data bandwidth (i.e. chroma).Thus lag can be reduced by increasing chroma compression and using 4:4:4 chroma will produce the highest input lag for a given display. I haven't found any hard rule, but it generally seems that an input lag of under 50ms is good enough for both for general computing and general video gaming. For comparison, higher-end 1080p monitors have around a 15ms input lag. A couple of other points. Many TVs have a "Game Mode" which will reduce input lag at the expense of video or color accuracy. This is an acceptable trade-off for most instances. Since Chroma 4-4-4 is not nearly as important in video games as it is for displaying text and programming, increasing the chroma compression to decrease input lag is a good trade off.    CNET article on input lag and their guidelines AV Form Post on cumulative input lag for gaming      So in summary, I went looking for a 4K television that:   Between 37" and 43" Capable of chroma 4:4:4 HDMI 2.0 Relatively low input lag Under $500   I looked at a number of options, but ultimately went with the Samsung 40" KU6290 for $300 (2016 holidays). The KU6290 is identical to the more popular 6300 except that is doesn't have the voice activated "smart" remote, and doesn't allow for Bluetooth audio connections. The television has good reviews on Amazon, and a number of people have recommended it for use as a computer monitor. Here is what I like about it   Multiple chroma levels (including 4:4:4) Low input lag Multiple modes (gaming, video, etc) Lots of customization options. Check out the Amazon reviews for a helpful guide on which values to set for use as a PC monitor. Available at a local retailer (Best Buy in my case) for ease of return Wall mountable (uses 400mm x 400mm VESA brackets)   This is an entry-level 4K tv, and there are some downsides. First, it has a low response time. Multiple reviewers have said that motion blur is noticeable in high-action movies. Second, the viewing angle is not very good when viewed more than 20 degrees off-center. Third, it can't reproduce as many colors as other TVs and monitors. None of these drawbacks are particularly worrisome for use as a PC monitor. The reduced color space may be an issue for graphic designers, but not for programmers.  Here is the Amazon listing and reviews for the Samsung KU6300  The TV will be arriving next week and I will update my post once I have it configured. I'll be using it with an MSI gaming laptop with a GTX 1070.
Well, they don't precisely have the same graphics card. Desktop PCs are always more powerful than a laptop by the simple concept that they don't need to save space.  Your question here would rather be based on whether you need it to be portable or not. Besides Intel HD4000 is an CPU-integrated video card and those are in my opinion far than optimal for render.  If you don't need portability you should go for a desktop computer with a $200-$300 USD GPU.  Needless to say the same comment on size goes for the RAM.
The best that I can come up with that meets your demands is the following:  Fiio X5 (2nd Gen)  Note, this is not exactly cheap:  Storage  Memory Type     Flash Memory  Memory Capacity     Dual Micro SD card Supporting up to 256GB (128GB x 2)  Expansion Slot     Micro SD  Screen  Display Size     2.4"  Display Resolution     400 x 360
Buffalo Router Specs  Amazon Link $104.99   This unit is USB Powerable via 5V USB Supports IEEE802.11ac/n/a/g/b   Note: I would recommend reading the reviews on this model as there are a few things that it cannot do.  IE: 2.4 and 5G at the same time / lack of superior managmment interface
Indeed, you need to use the Thunderbolt port of your MacBook to output the signal. According to everymac, your MacBook is definitely capable of outputting 4k@60Hz.  Now, you need a Mini Displayport to HDMI adapter, which does support 60Hz at 4k. I found this one, and a customer's review verifies that it does work on his MacBook Pro 2015.  Also note, that you need a HDMI 2.0 capable cable as well.
I would suggest:  Vantec VLink CB-HD20MDP12  UHD resolution up to 4096 x 2160 at 60Hz, 8-bit color Compliant to DisplayPort Specification 1.2 Compliant to HDMI Specification 2.0 HDCP 1.4 and HDCP 2.2 content protection 3D video up to 1080P@120Hz Color format: support RGB up to 12 bpc; YCbCr 4:4:4/4:2:2/4:2:0 up to 12bpc Audio input: support up to 8 channels of LPCM at 192kHz sample rate and 24-bit audio sample size, compressed audio and high bit rate DisplayPort: support 1.1a/ 1.2a/1.3; 1/2/4 lanes at 1.62/2.7/5.4 Gbps DisplayPort Spread Spectrum Clocking Supports 4K NVidia GTX series and ATI Graphics
D-Link AC-750 Portable  Amazon Link $98.09   IEEE802.11ac/n/a/g/b Allows simultaneous 2.4G and 5G Networks USB 5V Charging   Additionaly serves as an additional battery and power source for other devices.    From reading the reviews it seems to be able to run on its own power for at least 4 Hours
It is obvious that the GE62VR is a "better" laptop. All specifications on the two are equal with the exception of the following:  Hard Drive: GE62VR has an additional 256MB M.2 SSD Video Card: GE62VR has an additional 3GB memory  Let's get into video memory. While you do need a good video card for the applications you are planning on using, the memory is not necessarily a benefit for you.  Video memory will help you with:   Loading textures Holding the frame buffer Holding the depth buffer ("Z buffer") Holding other assets that are required to render a frame (shadow maps, etc.)   There is a great article at Tom's Hardware on video memory.  In the end the GE62VR is a "better" laptop, but if you are not in need of the M.2 SSD then I'm not sure if the extra bit of VRAM will help you that much.
For your listed purposes I would suggest the Apache Pro.  The SSD will speed up the loading of the OS, as well as editing programs installed to it, and the 16GB of ram will come in handy in media creation and 3D  modeling.
You can achieve this using an SDR (software-defined radio). It's essentially a device that can be programmed to transmit any radio signal you want:    These SDR boards are known to be able to produce GPS signals:   bladeRF (pictured above) HackRF USRP   (To configure one of those to send out GPS signals, you could use for example gps-sdr-sim, an open source Software-Defined GPS Signal Simulator.)
This is a tech support question and will likely be closed, but to answer the question, it should work.  I have in the past run multiple OS's on external disks, then installed them into the chassis with no problem.  All that changes is the connection interface.
Gargoyle provides exactly what you are looking for.  You did not indicate what requirements you had for speed but I would guess that lack of AC Compatibility would not be a deal breaker being how much the overages cost.  Gargoyle offers a router that is pre-loaded with their firmware. Link to Product The cost is currently $85.00  Specifications:   802.11 B/G/N, up to 300Mbps 5x 1Gbps Port WPA2, WPA and WEP supported   Here is the area where you can set a quota by IP  Additional Images of Interface  I believe that this will meet all your requirements.

I found the answer  here, by user spiff (First line edited to match context)   Dual band cards cannot connect to two signals at once, the term you are looking for is "simultaneous dual-band" which is also called "dual-band concurrent". I'm not aware of any client card that is. Simultaneous dual-band support is something only APs do, in order to support legacy 2.4GHz clients and more modern 5GHz clients at the same time.  If you want your dual-band client card to automatically pick the best band, make sure both radios in your simultaneous dual-band AP are publishing the same network name (SSID) with the same security mode and same password. I recommend WPA2-personal a.k.a. WPA2-PSK, and I recommend AES-CCMP only; don't bother enabling TKIP (this may be called something like "WPA2/WPA mixed mode") unless you know for a fact that you still have an old product around from c. 2002-2003 that supports TKIP but not AES.  If you don't have a simultaneous dual-band AP, and instead have two separate APs (one for 2.4 and one for 5GHz), still make sure they're both publishing the same network name, with the exact same security mode and password.
If you can find one, I would suggest going with an AMD Phenom II X6 1100T  I have a system running this chip, running as a server currently.  Nothing but smooth sailing when I was using it as a gaming/overclocking testbed.
You don't specify a price range, but your use of the word "cheap" implies you looked at what's commercially available and were shocked by the fact that even low-end tape drives run around $2000.  I'd recommend getting a secondhand Quantum TC-L52AN (internal drive) or TC-L52BN (the same thing, in an external enclosure).  I don't have experience with this particular model, but I've had good luck with Quantum tape drives in the past.  They run around $500-$800 on Ebay; you'll probably need a SAS controller card as well, but those can be found for under $100.  The LTO standard requires two generations of backward compatibility, so the current LTO-7 drives can read the TC-L52AN's LTO-5 tapes.  Ten years from now, you'll be able to get a secondhand LTO-7 drive to read your tapes.
I would suggest the following: Coolermaster MasterWatt Next Gen 90w  Universal convenience Up to 90% efficiency Nine different tips, including square Lenovo solution Meets latest US Level VI energy standards 100,000 hour(s) life expectancy
Finally LG will introduce the 32UD99 at CES 2017. LG states that it will fully support teh HDR10 standard. It also has 4K so it seems to meet the requirements of my question.  I'm still leaving the answer of INV3NT3D as accepted for now because full specification isn't out yet. Also now one knows if it'll be recommendable.
From Seagate's data sheet, I've noticed 3 things:    The only thing different across different models (with different serial numbers) is the capacity.   STEB5000200 is marketed for EMEA region (Europe, middle east and africa), while STEB5000100 is for America (NA I would suppose).   They both have 5TB capacity so there shouldn't be any obvious technical differences, apart from marketing, quota and maybe import tax.
As new information came in via a comment to the previous answer:  The Xeon E3 1515M v5 has Irisâ„¢ Pro Graphics P580 and can be used on the following mini-ITX from Advantec AIMB-242
I think your best option is number 3. (Macbook Pro / no TouchBar / Intel Dual-core i7 6th Gen (2.4GHz up to 3.4GHz) / 8GB RAM 1866MHz / 256 SSD - At 1800$ )  I can't find specific recommended RAM capacity for xcode, but android studio recommends 8GB. Furthermore, the 6th gen i7 has a better benchmark than the other models mentioned and should suffice.  In Conclusion:  Choose Option 3 Because:  8GB meets the hardware recommendations  The 6th Gen i7 (4700HQ I assume) has a higher benchmark than the other options. This should mean smoother performance.
The theoretical single-precision rating of a single Titan X Pascal is 11 TFLOPS per the media (ArsTechnica).  If you multiply 11 by 4, and assuming you have enough PCIe lanes to support all of these GPUs under full load, and assuming you have enough CPU and memory bandwidth to "feed" a real workload to each of these cards maxed out, that would be 44 TFLOPS single-precision.  You will never be able to use this kind of raw horsepower for gaming, even with an ideal workload on DirectX 12's EMA. The only way you could hope to utilize it all would be with a very high-end CPU (or perhaps multiple Xeon E5 CPUs), high clock rate DDR4 for system memory, and using OpenCL or CUDA on embarrassingly parallel single-precision workloads.
Looking at your requirements you could attain the best of a couple worlds by going with laptop that runs Windows 10.  The latest updates to Windows 10 offer an Ubuntu Bash Shell  Reference 1  Reference 2  This opens the doors to a lot of possibilities for you as far as laptops.  The Surface Book has received a lot of rave Reviews.   The Lenovo you specified seems to have some very mixed Reviews.  My personal experience with Lenovo (I have 2) is that they work great and start to fail around year 2.  Additionally the processor speed that you specified is not available in an I7 Mobile processor. Reference Intel  The only way you wound be able to get that would be to move to a "mobile workstation".  This will increase the bulk and reduce the battery life of the laptop since it will require a desktop processor  Additional Info:    If you need a more "fully functional" Ubuntu interface you can easily use the Hyper V option in Windows 10 Pro and have a fully fuctional version of Ubuntu. Instructions For Windows 8 but it will be almost the same for Windows 10.
At first, I would recommend you to rethink your Monitor Setup, UHD uses twice as many pixels in height than HD. If you move objects from one screen to another or just look from one to another, you will get serious headaches. I have this problem with a 1920x1200 main monitor and a 1280x720 second monitor.  On the other side, gaming or not, your setup will have a total resolution of 3840x3420. That means you will need something in the area of a GTX1070 or similar. This also means that you will have a good chance to find one with 3 Display Ports, which I also would recommend.  These cards that have 3 Display Ports and should do the job, if you want to be safe pick the GTX1070. If you want to try for a bargain, get a GTX1060. I can't recommend ATI, because I had some bad experiences with those.  Also, this is a shop link, because in this shop you can easily compare and look what else in on the market. You can select one and get them from somewhere else.  https://www.alternate.de/Hardware-Komponenten-Grafikkarten-PCIe-Karten-NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-Gaming/html/listings/1346?lk=8406&sort=PRICE&order=ASC&showFilter=false&filter_2203=NVIDIA+GeForce+GTX+1070&filter_2203=NVIDIA+GeForce+GTX+1060&filter_2249=3.0#listingResult
I would recomend the UDOO Family or the Odroid Family (Both came with their own Ubuntu flavor).        Wifi card included    Able to run 24/7 without overheating      If this works 24/7 you could damage the Wifi card; as you need for WiFi, you could instead buy an USB Wifi Module like this or this. The main attraction of the Pi 3 are the Wi-fi and Bluetooth, but in this case maybe is more important to invest in RAM, a best processor and heatsink.  For your budget an excellent investment would be the Odroid XU4  Processor: Samsung Exynos5422 Cortexâ„¢-A15 2Ghz and Cortexâ„¢-A7 Octa core  CPUs: Mali-T628 MP6(OpenGL ES 3.0/2.0/1.1 and OpenCL 1.1 Full profile)  RAM: 2Gbyte LPDDR3 RAM PoP stacked  USB: 2xUSB 3.0 Host, 1 x USB 2.0 Host  Ethernet: Gigabit Ethernet port  Size: 82 x 58 x 22 mm approx.(including cooling fan) <--- This is a BIG plus.
I would suggest a Parallella board. As mentioned above in regards to running wifi 24/7 and possible damage, you can always run an inexpensive Atheros based USB wifi dongle.  As stated on Parallella's page:  18-core credit card sized computer  â€¢ #1 in energy efficiency @ 5W  â€¢ 16-core Epiphany RISC SOC  â€¢ Zynq SOC (FPGA + ARM A9)  â€¢ Gigabit Ethernet  â€¢ 1GB SDRAM  â€¢ Micro-SD storage  â€¢ Up to 48 GPIO pins  â€¢ HDMI, USB (optional)  â€¢ Open source design files  â€¢ Runs Linux  â€¢ >10,000 boards shipped  â€¢ Starting at $99
Personally, I would just go with a raspberry pi, more specifically, the RPi 3 Model B Along with a USB wifi dongle such as this.  Cost totals out to about $49 USD ($40 for the RPi and $9 for the wifi dongle).  RPi's are capable of running 24/7, as mentioned here.  The main reasons why I would prefer a RPi are:   It is cheaper, compared to the other options provided. The support communities are much larger and documentation is widely available.  It is capable of being used for SSH.
Assuming you'd prioritise raw performance over portability and battery life, I'd recommend the   Dell Precision 15 7150 ($2,235)  It's a workstation laptop configurable to have a 512 GB NVMe SSD.  The CPU is an Intel Xeon E3-1505M v5, a quad core, hyperthreaded CPU, with base clock of 2.8 GHz and turbo up to 3.7 GHz (4 core turbo would be 3.5 GHz), it is one of the most powerful mobile CPUs currently on the market.  If you plan on heavily utilising the Intel graphics, or a large L4 cache appeals to you, then you can upgrade to the E3-1545M v5, with GT4e graphics, and the associated 128 MB of eDRAM on die.  In the default configuration, the laptop comes with Windows 10 Pro preinstalled, but you could choose to forgo that. With Ubuntu preinstalled, you save the licence price of $94. Note though, that they install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, not the latest 16.04 LTS or 16.10.  The laptop also comes with a Quadro M2000M. While a Quadro specifically isn't necessary, its 640 CUDA cores and 4 GB of VRAM make it well suited for accelerating TensorFlow using cuDNN.  RAM starts at 32 GB and is upgradable up to 64 GB. Upgrading to ECC RAM is also an option. Note that laptop OEMs tend to overcharge for RAM upgrades, so you might be better off purchasing your own, if you wanted more.  The display is a fairly mediocre 1080p one. You might choose to upgrade to 4K, or a wider gamut panel, add a camera or remove the microphone.  You might also like to upgrade to a backlit keyboard ($33), a higher capacity battery, add a second hard drive and/or add a RAID card.  To summarise: The Dell Precision is a highly customisable and powerful mobile workstation. It should take care of anything you throw at it with speed, and it also supports Ubuntu (optionally preinstalled).
If budget is no issue, and power both in CPU and GPU are desired, you can always go with: MSI 18.4" GT83VR TITAN SLI-024  USD $4,698.00  Note: This thing is a beast, in size as well as specs.  The way they have storage set up is as follows:  Super RAID 4â„¢ 1 TB SSD (PCIE Gen3x4) [512 GB x 2] + 1 TB SATA 7200 RPM HDD (Super RAID 4 denotes MSI software to configure raid without getting into BIOS, other than that, the drives are set in a RAID 0 config)  (DUAL)GeForce GTX 1080 8GB SLI (VR Ready)  Intel Core i7 6920HQ (2.90 GHz)  64 GB Memory 1 TB HDD 1 TB SSD (PCIE Gen3x4)  18.4" Full HD 1920 x 1080  16.85" x 12.36" x 1.66"-2.52" 13.13 lbs.   I'm running a (lowly) MSI GL62-6QF-628, which runs Ubuntu quite well, after selecting the closed source Nvidia drivers, as well as the Intel microcode options under additional drivers via the update utility thing (that for the life of me I cannot remember the name of.......the sprocket icon lol)
I'd totally go with x86 over ARM. And If you aren't that picky you can spec out what Jeff Atwood calls a scooter computer - these seem to be systems with 'laptop' class internals, often of older models, designed for digital signage. They're cheap, and actually pretty well built compared to some random ARM SBC  A minimal speced varient of this should work - I run a NUC class machine with a similar processor without the big aluminium/industrial case and it hardly even runs warm. Looks like 2gb/32gb would run you 150USD + shipping, Which should be under your budget. Ars technica uses another model as a router and they haven't had heating issues.  Also, ARM processors don't have the same level of support, and often have janky wifi.This has proper antenna ports and mini PCIe so, its a much better/flexible bet
Vilros makes pre-assembled kits for Beaglebones and Pis:   Beaglebone Black Starter Kit - Comes with pre-configured SD card, cables, and a case. No setup necessary. Raspberry Pi 3 Starter Kit - Comes with pre-configured SD card, working wifi and bluetooth, cables and a case. No setup necessary.   Personally I'd go for the Beaglebone, they're a bit beefier than the Pi. On the other hand the Pi has a very large support community.  The Vilros kits are great, you don't have to mess with anything, really, just turn them on out-of-the-box and you're ready to go.  Alternatively, you could just buy a used, cheap laptop and throw Ubuntu on it. Even new ones are close to your price range.
You can't go wrong with an Orange Pi board.   The Orange Pi One board costs $9 and with standard shipping, $14. It can capture and play video in 1080 @ 30fps.   https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Orange-Pi-One-ubuntu-linux-and-android-mini-PC-Beyond-and-Compatible-with-Raspberry-Pi-2/1553371_32603308880.html?spm=2114.12010608.0.0.3icumZ  Or go with the new Orange Pi PC 2. Which has full support for 4K video. It costs about $23 with standard shipping.   https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/New-Orange-Pi-PC-2-H5-64bit-Support-the-Lubuntu-linux-and-android-mini-PC-Beyond/1553371_32761481418.html?spm=2114.12010608.0.0.3icumZ  I believe the first board I posted also supports 4K but I'm not sure how quickly it would playback.
Every processor you mentioned here is a BGA style processor.  Effectively there are no consumer motherboards that support any of these chips.  Typically these chips are going to be used in an embedded system by system a integrator since they are required to be soldered to the board.    I have found a couple options for you but they are barebone systems.  I7-6770HQ   Frys  NewEgg
Generally, yes and without issue. However it will depend on the memory controller (Modern systems have moved this onto the CPU itself).  In almost all cases on modern systems you will see the RAM down-clock itself to match the lowest denominator of the chips, this might lower the FSB and the timings.  If one of the chips runs at an odd voltage however, I would not advise mixing them as the system likely won't finish POST.  Finally, if you have two banks for memory (1+2 & 3+4) generally the mismatched pair should sit on different banks. Refer to your motherboards manual for confirmation.  On the performance upgrade of 20%, we can't say without knowing what your utilization looks like and if RAM is the bottle neck. 4GB is a good minimum for just about any computer, doubling to 8GB+ will almost certainly provide a noticeably gain for most applications.
The focusrite 2i2 has what you need. Here is a link that has the full specs, but some of the relevant ones are:      Front panel         2x line/mic/instrument combination inputs high quality XLR / 1/4" TRS Jack    Combo 2x Line/Instrument switches    2x Gain knobs    2x Gain halo signal indicators 48V Phantom power switch Direct monitor switch   Large monitor level dial    USB Connection LED indicator    Headphone output - 1/4" TRS Jack    Headphone level knob         Rear panel         2 balanced monitor outputs 1/4" TRS Jack    USB 2.0 Port    Kensington Lock slot         Digital Performance: Supported rates 44.1 KHz, 48 KHz, 88.2 KHz, 96 KHz      Dimensions (H x W x D) 45 x 175 x 100mm / 1.77 x 6.88 x 3.93"       Weight 580g / 20.45oz   I regret not saving up for the 2i4, so you may want to consider that. But overall, I have been very happy with my 2i2, plus I must say, their customer service is excellent. Hope this helps!
For the best open tablets you will have to look at Replicant OS devices page.  These are the most open devices that exist, however neither of the two tablets meet your requirements.   You have two compelling alternatives however. One option, probably the fastest and most open, would be the Thinkpad X60 Tablet running Libreboot. It has a keyboard so it is rather large. The other alternative is an SOC like the BeagleBoard Black with a touchscreen addition (only seen this on a Raspberry PI), but those are small and awkward.  TL;DR: Your main options are the Galaxy Tab 2 with Replicant OS (FSF endorsed), the Libreboot Thinkpad X60 Tablet (Also FSF endorsed), or the BeagleBoard Black (not sure if this would work).
I am not aware of any non-x86 consumer-level CPUs, ie. ones where you can simply purchase and slot together all the parts for a computer.  Various ARM CPUs can be purchased individually, and OpenCores has some CPU designs that can be loaded up on an FPGA, but these aren't end-user-friendly: they require sufficient electrical-engineering skills to design a mainboard for connecting the CPU to things like memory or a video controller, or at least the assembly skills to build someone else's design.  The only non-x86 CPUs I'm aware of that were ever even remotely available to consumers in "build-your-own-computer" form were the DEC Alpha (discontinued in 2001) and the PowerPC (you could cobble together something from Apple spare parts until about 2005).
Money may be no object to you, but may well be for other readers, there for I'll keep budget in mind.  So if not budget, I assume that reliability and resilience are your primary concern. In which case, we can discard Bluray disks; no-one knows yet how these disks will fare over time, even if treated well. But given that they are usually physically more vulnerable, I'd certainly not rely long term on anything. In fact, I rip all my blurays disks as soon as I get them, just in case...  SO my recommendation is for a decent, even premium, NAS box running RAID 6 or 10, so you have (upto) 2 broken disks of leeway. 4 of the major players are Buffalo, Drobo, QNAP and Synology; I have experience of some sort with all other this companies' ranges, and I'd usually be happy with any of their offerings.  However, given that we're required to provide a recommendation, I'll plump for a a Qnap TS-431P which currently retails for approx 280GBP.  Relevant Features:   4 disk capacity -  Supports RAID 6 and 10 (and others) Gigabit Ethernet, eSATA and USB3 connections Low power hardware - useful if always on Decent performance compared to peers Decent useability - consumer/SOHO focused rather than corporate Decent reliability - assumed by brand Can function as a private cloud server, if that is of interest   Note: It it not possible to start small with RAID6/10 and scale up as needed. You could go with RAID1 (mirroring), add a disk and move to RAID 5, and then later add a disk and move to RAID6/10, but for each move you'd need to copy your data elsewhere while you made your changes, so this is not practicable.
Best earbuds for under $100, but comparable to $200+ earbuds. Has a kevlar reinforced cable with braided nylon for protection.  https://www.amazon.com/1MORE-Headphones-Earphones-Compatible-Microphone/dp/B01A7G35S0?th=1  Review site: https://www.cnet.com/products/1more-triple-driver-in-ear-headphones/
Supermicro offers a few motherboards with the FCBGA 1440 socket, mostly with a Xeon pre soldered, such as the X11SSH-GTF-1585 and the X11SSV-M4F (these both have 65 W TDP, by the way). These are micro-ATX and mini-ITX boards. However, as with the AIMB 242, these boards are more for enterprise, and sold in bulk. I've not been able to find any retailers carrying these SKUs, so your most probable solution is the Skull Canyon NUC. If you really want to though, contact Supermicro and ask about it.
Yes, that stylus will work. It's capacitive and so is your device.  Sometimes, online listings like that will include a list of "compatible" products, either in the title or in the description. The list doesn't really mean anything, but if someone searches something like:      stylus   the listings with  are more likely to show up higher in the search results.
Here is a sample of a system that does not meet your price requirements, which are a bit unrealistic, but meets the high RAM and multiple drive requirements.  [Origin PC:  EON 15 X PRO(https://www.originpc.com/workstation/laptops/eon15-x-pro/)  Max of 64GB ram   Max of 2x m.2 drives and 2x 2.5" drives  Note:  This is in the USD$3000 to USD$4000 range.  If you are not against using external SSDs, you can always use multiple SSDs, in USB 3.0 or eSATA enclosures, and just use double sided tape or velcro, and attach them to the lid of the laptop.
I would recommend a Precision 15 5000 Series (5510). It starts at about $1,360 and should meet your requirements.  It is reasonably powerful with the i5 6300HQ, with up to 1 terabyte of storage space. Fairly lightweight and portable. The Quadro CPU will improve graphics performance as well as provide CUDA capability for software that can utilize it.  Specs:  i5-6300HQ -- Quad Core, 2.3GHz base, turboboost to 3.2GHz  8GB DDR4 RAM  500GB HDD -- Different Harddrive configuration options available including: HDDs, SSDs, PCIe SSDs and self encrypting drives.  Nvidia Quadro M1000M -- 2GB GDDR5  FHD 15.6" Display  56Wh Lithium Ion Battery  ~4lbs.
The next best option I could come up with was the Dell Inspiron 17 i5759-7660SLV Signature Edition Laptop, which is currently on sale in the Microsoft store. It is selling for about $580, not including shipping or taxes.  It almost satisfies all your requirements, the exception being the price, which is 80 USD over your budget.  -  Specs:  i7 6500U -- Quad Core, supports up to 32GB RAM (Comes with 16GB of RAM) -- This CPU supports the following types of RAM: DDR4-2133, LPDDR3-1866 and DDR3L-1600  16GB of DDR3L-1600 RAM  17.3" 1080p display  1TB HDD -- This should be fairly easy to replace with either a SSD or something of greater capacity.  -  In terms of "upgradability", you don't have too many options.  You upgrade the RAM however, you will need two 16GB sticks since most laptops only provide two RAM slots. I am not sure whether the laptop's chipset will allow for 32GB, or for any other RAM type besides DDR3L-1600.  As for storage, you could upgrade the 1TB HDD, and replace the Optical Drive with a HDD caddy. Furthermore, you could add a high capacity SD card for more space.
I would recommend the Z170A SLI PLUS. It costs about $135 on Amazon.com. I use this motherboard in a personal rig, and it performs well.  The reasons why I would recommend this motherboard are:   It uses the z170 chipset, which is overclockable, and because it will allow you to overclock you unlocked i5 6600k. Supports DDR4-3000 RAM Has four DIMM slots Has room for large CPU coolers -- I'm using a Thermaltake NiC C5 with this motherboard. The NiC C5 a large cooler but, it still allows me to use all four RAM slots. 6 SATA ports with RAID 0, 1, 5 and 10 Support Reinforced PCIe x16 Slots for large graphics cards Excellent Overclock-ability  ATX Form Factor Reasonable iGPU performance (integrated GPU)
I don't think you're going to get what you want for $250. You're describing something like the S7 ($680+), or maybe the Axon 7 ($400+ and no water resistance). Smartphones are getting cheaper and "flagship killers" like the Axon 7 and OnePlus are on the rise, but they're not down to the low-end prices yet.   As for older phones, I don't know if any will really fit what you want, either. You may get that Â£200 pricepoint, but some features, like water resistance, only became popular this year. The Galaxy S5 does have IP67 (with the back on), but it's a 1080p screen, and the same processor as your Z2 (there is the LTE-A version, which has QHD, but it doesn't have LTE B20). You might have to raise your budget a bit if you want to keep water resistance.  If you're fine with giving up the IP rating, these older phones might be what you want:   Note 4 - SD 805, 3GB RAM, QHD Screen 5.7" -- Â£260 eBay LG G3 - SD 801, 3GB RAM, QHD Screen 5.5" -- Â£123 eBay LG G4 - SD 808, 3GB RAM, QHD Screen 5.5" -- Â£250 eBay   If you need that water resistance and can give up a QHD screen:   S5 - SD 801, 3GB RAM, 1080p Screen 5.1" -- Â£215 eBay   I think you should go with a newer phone, though, since you say you want a CPU/modem upgrade. The phones above are all 1-2 years old and a little outdated. They do all have good development scenes though, and I know CyanogenMod 14.1 is out for the Note 4. With Cyanogen's recent disconinuation, development there has been halted, but will be picked up with Emotion AOSP some time next year.  Even in newer phones, it's really only the flagships getting water resistance, and some still aren't, like the V20. These are way above your pricepoint, so if you get a modern phone, you have to give up water resistance.  Your requirements somewhat contradict.    You want an older phone, because of the price, but it needs to have an upgraded modem from the Z2, which is hard since that's only 2.5 years old.  You want a high resolution screen on an older phone. I don't know if that means you're fine with 1080p, but I'm taking it to mean QHD. Not too many phones from 1/2 years ago have QHD. You want water resistance. Like I said before, water resistance wasn't that popular until very recently. Even now, it's only on highly-priced options. You want something between Â£100 and Â£200, which just isn't realistic, even looking at 2-year-old options. Â£400-Â£500 is better.     Ultimately, I'd recommend you get the Axon 7 (not the Mini). It's around Â£430 new on eBay for the 128GB version, so you can probably find it cheaper than that used with a lower capacity. I know it's above your budget, but like I said before, it's just not a realistic range. For the price, you get:   QHD 5.5" Screen -- High resolution and matches your size request SD 820 -- Technically still the newest high-end Qualcomm (SD 821 isn't really a new generation) SD Card Slot 20MP Camera @ Æ’/1.8 -- I hear the camera software is a little iffy, but there are third party options, and that was months ago 8MP Selfie Camera @ Æ’/2.2 -- Higher up in the resolution range It has a UK/EU variant, so it's good with cellular technology. Gorilla Glass 4 Separate 3.5mm Headphone Jack Stereo Front-Facing Speakers -- audio won't be a problem A Great Development Scene -- ZTE is encouraging user feedback and supporting custom development   It's only missing the water resistance, and that can just be fixed with a lifeproof case or some Super Glue if you're daring ;).  There are other options, but I think this is the phone that most closely matches your requirements, with the price in mind.  UPDATE: Amazon has an unlocked version for under Â£400. I don't know if it's actually a UK compatible version (details are sparse), but I reckon it is, and Amazon is pretty good with its return policies.
Since you are not looking to overclock or anything save yourself a few bucks and go with the I7-6700 Retail Box I7-6700 on Amazon.  Fan verification based on model from Intel. It is said to include Thermal Solution - E973979. Link for Picture  If you decide you want to go with a i7-6700K you have two options  Fan cool it and never plan on overclocking us a Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO.  Water cool it with a Corsair Hyrdo H60 and give yourself flexibility on being able to overclock in the future and stay in your budget.  In the end, there is no need to spend the extra money on the "K" version of the CPU to begin with if you are not going to overclock
You might try what's described in this video.   Basically what he does is bend the "retention pins" inside the female end of the USB port so that the male plug is held in more firmly.  I'm not sure if your "USB drive" is a "stick" that just plugs in, or a short cable with a portable HDD on the end.  If it is a portable hard drive with a cable, (see image) you could do what user NZKshatriya suggested in a previous question and "just use double sided tape or velcro, and attach them to the lid of the laptop.".  So in conclusion, the two best options I think you have are:   Bend the (possibly loose) USB "retention pins" on the female USB plug  "just use double sided tape or velcro, and attach them to the lid of the laptop" (assuming that it is a portable hard drive)
Top of the line for external sound would be the Creative X7  Official page  Also:  3.5mm to RCA adapter  And in case you need the reverse of that adapter:  RCA female to 3.5mm adapter
If you're looking to purchase new, and want roughly comparable single-precision computing power, I recommend the MSI Radeon R7 250, $75 from Newegg.  It's got about 70% the single-precision speed of the 4870, twice the RAM, and draws half the power.  Note that if you need double-precision computing power, this is a bad choice: it's only 20% as powerful as your current card.  If you need double-precision computing power, I recommend you look on Amazon or Ebay for another 4870.  The HD 4000 series had unusually high double-precision performance, and a modern replacement will run you at least $200.
Assuming you have any basic level of competence, the hardware on most of these is a bit... naff, running lower end mips or arm processors, tied up with a custom ASIC.  About 200usd would get you something with significantly more flexibility, 4 ethernet ports and such. It might even be more powerful, but I haven't really found documentation on what these run.   There's similar boxen on amazon according to ars technica, who have run extensive tests on it.  As for OSes are concerned, I'd go with pfsense - its actively updated, bsd based and pretty well documented, understood.   There's no annual fee (though pfsense has their own hardware and support program). You're essentially paying a fee for updates anyway unless you have a pretty darned good support contract.
Sockets are the answer.  Generally, modern intel CPUs use sockets in the LGA 11xx format.  I don't know what your CPU uses for it's socket, but before you ask: no, you cannot get socket adapters for cpus.  If the sockets aren't compatible, you need a new motherboard, and maybe more.  The socket type should be silkscreened onto the motherboard somewhere.  Read the top comment on this answer for a bit more info.
Buy Apple EarPods.  They are very loud, have volume up/down and pause buttons built in, and a microphone.  My first pair lasted me years.  They are $30 new I think and have great sound quality for the price.  Again, it took me 4 years for the wires in them to come loose and unreliable.  The don't have active noise cancellation, but do block out noise pretty well regardless (from my experience)
You could use a HDMI to SCART converter like this one.   Operation is fairly simple, you take the HDMI output from your computer and plug it into the HDMI input on the converter, then plug your TV's SCART cable into the SCART output on the converter.  Since your computer has a VGA output, add a VGA to HDMI converter like this one.   VGA output -> VGA to HDMI converter -> SCART Converter -> TV input.  You will probably need to match the output resolution with the resolution of your TV.
Try a Nvidia GeForce 1050. It's about $110 on Amazon and good enough for your needs with that machine. Yes, it's Nvidia, but you don't need to replace an AMD with an AMD.  Anything more powerful than this, you should just consider upgrading your whole computer.
Perhaps it is not what you really wants, but the palette gear solution looks very good in terms of customability and compatibility with Adobe products.  With such a device you can:   Keep your keyboard / mouse for the normal use have sliders, potentiometers or buttons in the order you want configure each controls to your needs and per software   I did not try it myself but a French magazine tried and they had a good feedback about it (and this is my feeling as well).
The other answer's suggestion is a bit expensive for my taste (with several hundred dollar).  So I can recommend the soundcard I'm using myself to power my 5.1 speaker system. However you don't really need all the features so instead I'm gonna recommend the functionally largely equivalent, but cheaper version:  The ASUS Xonar U5  On Amazon.com and on the official website.  For the relevant I/O it features 3x 3.5mm jack output for your speakers as well as S/PDIF. The audio processor seems to be just slightly worse than that of my card but should still do a good job. Not that I don't know whether Dolby Live (a driver technology to dolby digital encode the system audio on the fly so you can squeeze the data into the bandwith limit) is a thing for the U5 so you may not be able to use more than two speakers over SPDIF.  OS compatibility is a given and it will work with all Windows and OS X / macOS versions (at least down to Win7).  If you're feeling fancy you could also go with the Xonar U7 however then you'd have to look out for the fact that left and right have RCA instead of 3.5mm jack output (but the bundled software seems to be better with the U7).
HD Radeon RX 460 is the way better option.  Since an AMD solution was explicitly requested for technical reasons, how about the XFX HD Radeon RX 460 for $99? It's significantly better than the R7 250 and not much more expensive.
I found a dash cam that fits your requirements:  AUKEY Dash Cam, Full HD 1080P, 170Â° Wide Angle Lens, Night Vision, Car Dashboard Camera  It sells for $90 on Amazon.com     Supports recording resolutions of: 1080p 30fps, 720p 30/60fps, 480p No wifi or internet connection Saves to a MicroSD card (up to 128GB) Good night vision capaiblity (according to product description and "Verified Purchase" reviews) Below 100 USD (90 USD) Can record continuously (loop/overwrite) or do timelapses Has a microphone Wide FOV (170 degrees) Screws on to a suction cup or adhesive mount (since it is a dash cam)     It is only USB powered, meaning that you might need a USB power brick like  this. Also, if you want to record in 1080p for 10 or so hours, I would recommend a SD card with a capacity of at least 64GB.
The technical document (page 3-10, which is the tenth page of that PDF) for this drive says it's a standard SATA connector; 15 power pins P1-15 and 7 signal pins S1-7. For this, you'd need a standard double SATA signal/power connector; something like this, perhaps.  However, something about your pictures looks off. Look at the pictures of the cable I linked to above, in particular this one:    The connectors in this image don't match up with the images you posted of your own drive. As NZKShatriya mentioned in a comment, I suspect that HP have modified the connector on the drive so that you are forced to use their products.  If you still have the old HP laptop, your best shot at getting the data off the drive is to reinstall the drive, and use the laptop to transfer data to a more modern, more widely compatible solution (like a USB stick; you could fit the entire contents of that drive onto a 128 GB USB stick like this one). If that fails, you're stuck with contacting HP and asking them how to get your data.  Good luck!
I originally posted this article on:  HP laptop/MHV2120BH HDD as a comment.  It turns out that the correct connection is/was always there.  There was an adapter fitted over the SATA connector, for use with HPs internal connector.  Am re-posting as an answer in order for others to find more easily.

You might take a look at this: Dell U2715H 27-Inch Widescreen IPS LED Monitor on Amazon.co.uk for  Â£394.93  Fits your requirements:   1440p Resoluiton 60Hz Refresh Rate 27 inch IPS LED  Multiple Display Inputs: 2x HDMI, 1x Mini Display Port Under budget   The average review for this screen on Amazon.co.uk is 4.6/5, which isn't too bad. The average is 4.4/5 on Amazon.com.   One review on the .co.uk site does mention dead pixels however, I wouldn't be too concerned since the majority of reviews expressed satisfaction with the performance/quality of the display.
Below you will find a link to a device that has only 1 review but it is a good review.  I made the assumption that you are in or near the UK since you requested the price in Euros.  It does require software to be installed on the computer though.

Maybe a mobile document scanner would work for you. Something like the Canon imageFORMULA P-208II  It is small, has duplex functionality (scans both sides at once), and scans 8 pages per minute (7.5 seconds per page). I don't know your budget, but a little bit over 100 Â£/130 â‚¬ doesn't seem that bad.  I have no experience with this scanner, but a rating 4.3 of 5 on amazon seams quite good.  Here are some other similar scanners
I am going to give three options here.  I am not sure if they will hit the budget you are looking for but they are all GREAT scanners.  I personally own the IX500 and it is the best scanner I have ever owned.  This includes being better than commercial scanners that cost upwards of $5000.  Fujitsu iX500 @ Amazon $415.93  Excellent scanner that includes color scanning, 50 page ADF and duplex.  The scanner is fast and scans 25 double sided pages per minute.  The device also has wireless capability.  The scanner is super small not much larger than a loaf of bread when closed up.  Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300i @ Amazon $241.07  This scanner only does 12 double sided pages per minute but it can be powered purely off of USB.  Fujitsu ScanSnap iX100 @ Amazon $193.00  This is the lease expensive of the scanners and does not have an ADF.  It is still a good scanner and does offer wireless connectivity.  It weights less than half a kilo and is battery powered for maximum portability.  The docs say it can scan 260 pages on a single charge.  Please note that I am very biased towards this brand of scanner since I have had such an excellent experience with them.  I have scanned over 40,000 Pages on my iX500.  Please make your own decision but I think you will find the reviews you can find on the internet will also follow my feelings on the product.
To translate your dimensions into normal terms, you're looking for a Mini-ITX (or Mini-DTX) board.  I'd recommend the Asus H110I-PLUS/CSM, $86 from Newegg:   6.7" x 6.7" Socket LGA1151 Two RAM slots supporting a total of 32 GB One PCIe 3.0 x16 slot Reasonably "full-featured": 4 SATA ports, 6 USB ports, Ethernet, eight-channel audio   The chipset and voltage regulators are passively cooled with small heatsinks, which may or may not be a problem for a "very closed off case".  I don't have any experience with this particular product, but I've had good luck with Asus mainboards in the past.  Here is a Wikipedia link to form factor sizes for reference.  This can provide you all the options for size options that are offered based on size standards.  Keep in mind that anything smaller than Mini-ITX is unlikely to have a PCIe slot, and is likely to have just a single SO-DIMM slot for memory.
This is the only one I was able to find that meets all of your requirements.   The memory comes with 16gb in this config, what I consider the minimum to meet your needs. Its up-gradable to 32gb.   The GPU is a 960M, this will push most game @ 1080p in high/ultra settings just fine. Poorly optimized AAA games might have to be toned down by removing shadows or something.   Its super lightweight, coming in at under 4 pounds... thats crazy to me.   Also, its within your price range, name brand and ships to Australia.   MSI 14" GS40  Product Specs  Other laptops that meet requirements (Minus price req)
The answer would be no, there are no USB-C splitters in existence.  Neither are there any USB-(insert connector style here) splitters.  USB cannot be split per se, but hubs can be used to connect multiple USB devices to one USB port.
I cannot find a cube style but the following did come across as a good option.  SilverStone PS08B @ Newegg 39.99  SilverStone PS08B @ Amazon(prime eligible) 39.99  Just posted the Newegg link along with the Amazon link, due to the fact that Newegg is much better with item specifications....and power searches...than Amazon is.  Just a few specs on the case: 2 x USB 3.0 / Audio Front Ports  Side Air duct  2 External 5.25" Drive Bays  4 Internal 3.5" Drive Bays
I would go with a desktop build like this.   It is on a Z170a chipset, which will allow you to overclock if you decide to upgrade to a K series skylake or kabylake CPU. The cooler should accommodate a reasonable overclock.   With the z170a SLI plus, you can use 2 way SLI or 3 way crossfire if you have compatible GPUs. The GTX 1060 should easily tackle most 2016 games.  2 drives: a SSD for boot and for software that you need to access quickly (like games) and a 1TB HDD for storing files.  Specs/Parts are as follows:  -CPU: Intel Core i3-6100 3.7GHz ($118.98 @ Amazon)   -CPU Cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO ($34.99 @ Amazon)   -Motherboard: MSI Z170A SLI PLUS ($135.95 @ Amazon)   -Memory: Corsair Vengeance 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR4-2133 ($49.99 @ Amazon)   -Storage: Samsung 850 EVO-Series 250GB 2.5" SSD  ($89.99 @ Amazon)   -Storage: Western Digital Caviar Blue 1TB 3.5" ($49.99 @ Amazon)   -Video Card: EVGA GeForce GTX 1050 2GB ($116.99 @ Amazon)   -Power Supply: EVGA 500W 80+ Certified ATX Power Supply  ($37.99 @ Amazon)   -Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10 Home OEM 64-bit  ($90.72 @ Amazon)   -Case: Thermaltake Versa H22 ($43.46 @ Amazon)   Total: $769.05 (for the PC build, $859.05 with additional laptop RAM)  --  You can upgrade your laptop from 6GB to 16GB of RAM, but I would only do this if I needed the extra RAM. Having extra RAM isn't going to make a difference in performance you aren't said extra RAM.     I'm asking if it is a wise choice to upgrade a my laptop to 16 GB of RAM knowing that I have a processor with only 2 physical cores.   In response to that, core count doesn't necessarily mean you can't use more RAM. You should be able to utilize as much RAM as the manufacturer says is supported.The i5 3230M supports up to 32GB of RAM, but I believe this is limited to 16GB in your laptop (due to chipset limitations?). Furthermore, your laptop's i5 3230M is dual core and hyperthreaded. Basically, it's like having four cores.  --  If you feel like you need more RAM for your laptop take a look at something like this:  - TimetecÂ® (P/N 76TT13NUS2R8-8G) Dual Rank 1333MHz DDR3 (PC3-10600) Non-ECC Unbuffered CL9 204 Pin SODIMM 2Rx8 512x8 1.5V Windows PC Laptop Notebook RAM Memory Module Upgrade (16GB (2x8GB)) ($80 @ Amazon)  --  N.B.: I have ommitted shipping charges, since I'm not sure where you need the parts to be shipped (internationally, locally etc...) (also depends on where you order the parts)
I was able to work around this solution with the use of a couple of HD68 to IDC50 converters and an IDC50 cable. Not the best solution but it looks like the connector on the board was a bit too propriety (even though it was still a standard SCSI cable). In the end it worked and there does not appear to be any interference from using a short internal cable externally.  I was able to find the Dell cable (P/N: 5984D), though that did turn out to be male on both ends, it was worth a shot.  Hope this helps anybody that might run into this.
So, there is no keyboards with a dedicated "B" key on both sides so I found the next best thing.   The Ergo Pro is fully separated, and has some good reviews. but what it has that you really need, an extra key to the left of the N key, on the right side. The reason this is important is because you can easily remap that key to send in a b.   Map Any Key to Any Key on Windows 10, 8, 7, or Vista - This article gives you a little write up about how this can be done and even gives a software rec that looks extremely basic. I haven't looked, but I'm certain there are Mac key remapping programs as well.   I originally found this keyboard In this article. It was determined to be one of the best split key keyboards around.   Here is the companies website, they have it listed for $200
For overall "OUT OF THE BOX" compatibility you are going to be better off going with a PC.   Performance wise comparing the two you will get the following benefits of the base model Alienware laptop over the MacBook.  1) Faster Processor  2) Larger HDD  3) Much better video card (the MacBook only has Intel Iris integrated video)  4) $100 Less expensive with reward card rebate  All of these items are using the base model Alienware laptop that you provided a link for.  With the extra money you could add some more power or featurs or move up the next model.
Personally I would go with the Acer Aspire V17 Nitro.  Screen  17.3 inch, 3840 x 2160 px   Processor   Intel Skylake Core i7-6700HQ CPU, quad-core 2.6 GHz (3.5 GHz TBoost)  Video   Intel HD 530 + Nvidia GTX 960M 4GB  Memory  16 GB DDR4 2133Mhz (2xDIMMs)  Storage 512 GB SSD + 1 TB 2.5â€³ HDD  Its lightweight Despite the its  960M It has a 512GB nvme SSD, 4k display and a damn 7hr battery life, since you are a programmer you might consider that, at a price around $1700. But smart would also be to wait for CES 2017 releases.
This was a hard one to find!   This is my recommendation, the Griffin PowerMate Multi-Media Control Knob with Bluetooth Connectivity - Wirelessly control your Mac from Volume to Key Commands    It has software that will let you change what the knob does. So instead of Volumn Up/Down, you will make it scroll up/down.    The only reason I could see this not working is if the form factor is an issue, but Honestly I think this might be as close as were going to get lol.     EDIT*   Apparently, this company make a wide range of these types of products so if you don't like the aesthetic of this one, search by company name online and I'm sure you'll find something that meets your needs better.   Edit2* This "3d" mouse might be an option as well, it doesn't meet all of your requirements but it looks pretty freaking cool  Edit 3*    Last one I swear, this is a wireless tiny trackpad that you might be able to keep on the desk where your thumb can get to it.... Logitech Rechargeable Trackpad for Mac.  I was trying to find a trackpad sticker... something that you could actually stick to the side of the keyboard frame and rub your finger on to scroll, but no luck on that front.    Alright that's all I have.
The FSF has h-node, a database of hardware that works with free operating systems. Currently, the only PCIe WWAN adapter in the list is the Sierra Wireless, Inc. MC8775.  There is one caveat, however: some laptop models have a BIOS that will refuse to boot an operating system if a third-party WWAN adapter is found which is not on a â€œwhitelistâ€ of the BIOS. HP is notorious for this, and the 6930p is among those modelsâ€”so check before you buy! Alternatively, some sites offer BIOS upgrades which remove the whitelisting (just google â€œHP 6930p WWAN whitelistâ€ for more information), no experience with that, though.
From what I have been able to find, using an HP datasheet on the Gen 5.  On the Expansion Slots section it is stated:    Expansion Slots:  More PCI-Express slots with up to eleven available with option card Eight slots standard: (4) full length PCI-E x8, (1) full length PCI-E x4 and (3) half length PCI-E x4 slots; Optional card adds (3) PCI-X or (3) PCI-E x8  Now, what this "option card" is completely eludes me, as I have not been able to find any information on this on my own.
In addition the the GeChic (there's 13 and 15 inch versions), there is an Acer that claims to have Mini-HDMI input:   Acer DA220HQL 21.5-Inch Android All-in-One Touchscreen Desktop  https://www.amazon.com/Acer-DA220HQL-21-5-Inch-Android-Touchscreen/dp/B00CHYKVPQ $500  Other than that there's a HD900 thing that's a bit hard to get  HD900vision - SHENZHEN G-VISION TECHNOLOGY CO.,LTD http://www.flysight.com/otherbar1734363.htm  And not much else
My router that I use has this feature. It is called MAC cloning. They currently go for less than $30 on Amazon. They are a bit dated but will give you an idea what to look for.  Asus - RT-N12B1
For longevity... I would go with the kabby lake processor. the i7-7700K.  It is the most recent, and you will get the most life out of it.    Do I recommend upgrading from the 5820 or 4790 to the 7700? No. Because the difference between them is minor. Intel has been gearing their cpu improvements towards lower tdp not raw horse power. Now, the lower tdp does offer more overclocking headroom, but I'll save that for the bottom of this answer.   Here is a Linus Tech Tips forum article about it. It summarizes my feelings on the subject. If you have an i7 4790k or i7 5820k it's simply not worth the upgrade. BUT if your starting with a fresh build, its worth buying into it now.    My overclocking statement. The benefit to having a lower tdp is more overclocking headroom, and with proper cooling you can exploit that. Being able to overclock will definitely buy you some time when your computer is starting to show its age. I currently have a 4790k, I have not overclocked it yet mainly because I don't have an aftermarket cooler yet... but the minute it starts to slow down, its the first thing I'm going to do.    There are quite a few people here better prepared to answer this question and I would love for them to chime in as well.
I suggest you to read these articles: for 2011-v3 successor http://wccftech.com/intel-x299-chipset-skylake-x-kaby-lake-x/ and for 1151 successor http://wccftech.com/intel-cannonlake-cpu-300-motherboards-2017/  They clearly explain that the x99 / 2011-v3 socket and x200 / 1151 won't last more than few months, since it's almost certain that intel won't support them with newer cpus (skylake-x and cannonlake/coffelake).  Since you repeated a lot the word FUTURE I have to say that you have chosen sockets/chipset that won't be upgraded anymore by Intel with newer CPU.  So one option is to buy something NOW, and I suggest to choose the 2011-v3 platform with the right motherboard because you are sure that can buy now a Core i7-5820K (3.3GHz, L3:15M, 6C, HT, 140W, rev.R2) and in the future update it to a, for example, Intel Xeon E5-2687W-v4 (3.0G,160W,L3:30M,12C,HT) with less money than today (also selling your first CPU).  The other option is to wait for the next first next platform between X299 or cannonlake/coffelake chipset 300 and you will be sure that for other 2 generations of processors you will be able to upgrade them. I would suggest cannonlake cpu that will be also 6/8 cores (plus HT) instead of the top cpu of 1151 that is only 4 cores (plus HT). Sadly my last phrase has no direct support from leaked slides (see: http://wccftech.com/intel-roadmap-kaby-lake-coffee-lake-cannonlake-leak/ and: http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/09/14/exclusive-the-secret-of-intel-corporations-coffee.aspx ) so it could be taken as a speculation.   Take into account also that this year AMD will show ZEN CPU and in function of the real value/performance of the platform I think that INTEL will be forced, or not, to push to an higher rate of cores on mainstream cpu sector
I did quite a bit of research on this issue and it seems that all the cables that you are looking at tend to be unreliable / don't work / only provide 1000ma.  There are additional options that include rooting your device.  After coming to the conclusion that they were not "GOOD" options I found the following.  RavPower Filehub @ Amazon  This product has good reviews and will allow you to bridge your tablet to a wired or wireless network.  Additionally you get the convenience of being able to to use Micro SD cards as well.  While there are other options there is not guarantee that they will work and this is the only full proof solution I could find for you.  EDITS: (To explain functionality of device)  You DO NOT need to root your device for this to work as mentioned about other devices in the comments above.  This device is a wireless / network bridge.  Effectively you would connect this device to you existing wired / wireless network and it will create a secondary wireless network for your tablet to connect to.  You can plug your USB or SD Card into the device (Or even a USB hard drive) and then you can access the files on them through either a web browser by connecting to the ip address of the RavPower Filehub or by using the FileHub app that can be downloaded on your tablet. Link to Product Manual  As far as charging your device too it only provides 1 amp of power so some devices will not charge.  That being said the port on the tablet will not be used so you can easily plug in your power cord.  2nd EDIT:  The product is only 2.9 inches x 2.7 inches x .9 inches so it is very portable.
I have found a list of ELinux compatible keyboards Here there are quite a few with trackballs to choose from.  Specifically the LC-Power K1000BMW has been tested with Debian 6.0.04  I have also found that the Emprex 9039ARF III has customer reviews that confirm its functionality in Ubuntu Squeeze as well as another version of linux that the customer did not specify  Lastly and probably your best option is the IOGear 2.4GHz as I was able to find CONFIRMED customer interaction specifically for Ubuntu compatibility.
You might take a look at the NZXT Source 530.  It fits all of your requirements:   Can mount 1 SSD (2.5") and 1 HDD (3.5"), however it does have space for additional drives (3x 5.25", 6x 2.5" or 3.5") Full Tower ATX case (Fits ATX motherboards and is a Full Tower) Fits ATX PSUs Has standoff points and standoffs included in the box Within your budget. It can be found on Amazon for $85, Newegg for $85 and on NZXT for $90.   It also has a few nice features such as:   Dust Filters Mounts for water cooling Modular drive cages Space for several fans (7-9 fans max, dependent on fan diameter)
Lenovo ThinkPad T460 supports up to 32GB RAM and can be ordered in such configuration. Price tag for most most basic config with 32GB RAM is $1200.
I would suggest going with Lenovo due to ease of maintenance, durability and overall decent build quality.  I have found a Lenovo ThinkPad X260 that fits your specifications. Their website claims that the machine has up to 21 hour battery life which is sort of crazy.   There are various models, but they all come with:   Processor: Intel i5 or i7  RAM: 16GB Storage: 500GB - 1 TB HDD or 128GB to 512GB SSD  Screen Size: 12.5 inches Resolution: 1920x1080  Price: $1200 - $1300   Additional information regarding this model can be found at the Lenovo Website  Price of the model with configuration that you seek is between $1200 and $1300.
For $100 or less, I'd honestly suggest you to get a used PlayStation 3 since it can do the stuff you described you're looking for. It displays playing clips instead of icons for the files, has many sorting options, and supports h264 and can output the content at 1080p. Best part of all? It can upscale DVDs to 1080p as well, even the file stored on your hard drive. PS3 can also be configured to use a BD Remote but the joystick which comes with the system will do just fine as well. In addition to all of this, you will also be getting one of the best blu-ray players, should you get back to collecting movies and tv shows the physical way. The only downside is that it uses USB 2.0 and has one HDMI output.
I would recommend a piece of software called plex media server. With a piece of hardware to attach to your TV. Plex is very responsive on gen 1 amazon firesticks, so 35$ and you are off to the races.    Plex will sort and organize your videos. Along with downloading all of the metadata you'd like. Subtitles, links to trailers, poster art.. you name it..  With the firestick attached to your TV, you use the provided remote and just watch what you want. It won't use your internet, but will use your network to stream the content.    Plex.tv is their website. They will try to upsell you a 5$ per month plan, you don't need it so don't bother signing up for it.   Here is the firestick, this one is 39.99 but comes with a voice controlled remote.  Side note, I'm a plex user and I also HATE how kodi looks. Welcome to plex my friend, welcome to plex.
It appears that this isn't possible.  So I tested the device I bought below and it doesn't work with cd drives.  I am not sure why.  This appears to work but only works on the laptop cd drives.  Which means the power would be a problem on a desktop computer.  USB 2.0 to 7+6 13Pin Slimline SATA Laptop CD/DVD Rom Optical Drive Adapter Cable Black/White  https://www.amazon.com/13Pin-Slimline-Laptop-Optical-Adapter/dp/B00C574Q5G/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1485286747&sr=8-2&keywords=external+cd+drive+with+sata
I've seen only one so far, Bourge Design's Arc Hub:  https://www.bourgedesign.com/archub  I don't believe the hub is available yet, but it's scheduled for release within the next couple of months.  Unfortunately, it's not suitable for my own needs, as the device's two type-C ports are apparently for charging only--no data. I also want "Gen. 2" type-A ports; the Arc seems to feature type-A Gen. 1 (USB 3.0).
I would go with the Sager NP3245    A configuration of a 256Gb m.2 SSD as the OS drive and storage drives leaves room for future upgrades.  Does not come with a discrete GPU, but uses the on chip Intel graphics.  Has 8Gb, 16Gb, 32Gb Ram options.  Has other customization options, at the buyers discretion.
For everyone with the same problem: i did it with an extra sat>ip server, the digibit r1. It can be used in tvheadend seamlessly.
Dell. In your build, select the option for SSD. My recommendation would not be for touchscreen just yet on the 15" screen because it isn't QUITE up to the level of larger displays used for rendering and image creation. Still keep the UHD screen though.  You mentioned traveling. The Alienware laptop weighs in at a full 10lbs whereas the Dell weighs in at 3.9 lbs. The 17" laptop isn't even close to ideal for traveling. That's really going to be the deciding factor here.
I think that the Alienware with the GTX 1070 is going to work better for your application. When considering the GPU options.  GTX 1070 vs Quadro M1200.  The GTX 1070 has 1920 CUDA cores vs. 640 CUDA cores from the Quadro M1200  GTX 1070 is rated for 6.5 TFLOPS vs. 1.4 TFLOPS    In terms of benchmarks (these are the desktop versions, I can't find benchmarks for the m1200)  Passmark:  GTX 1070: 10,973  Quadro K1200: 2992    In conclusion, if you are looking for GPU power, the laptop with the GTX 1070 (Alienware) is going to be the better option, if you need professional driver support, then take the Quadro (Precision Workstation). I know there is driver support for CUDA 8.0 cards (in blender) so that isn't an issue.
So far I've only found one VR headset which features inside-out positional tracking and does not require connecting to a desktop computer: the Occipital Bridge.  It's $399, only works with iPhone 6 or later running on iOS 9 or later, and is capable of both virtual reality and mixed reality.  It ships in March but is available for pre-order now.  Other answers are welcome.  EDIT: The shipping date for the Occipital Bridge has been moved to April 28.  EDIT 2: The shipping date has now been moved to Mid-May.  EDIT 3: It was finally released on May 26.
You already had the exact way to find which DIMMs to use, you just didn't know it.  Go to whichever site you prefer to use to buy PC components, and search for DDR3 PC3-12800 1600Mhz, make sure to specify SODIMM (laptops) or DIMM (Desktops)  If you would like a recommendation:  I would suggest G.SKILL F3-12800CL11S-4GBSQ  Reasons being: This is a standard SO-DIMM for laptops.  27 USD on newegg, lifetime warranty from the manufacturer (I have been using G.Skill for over 10 years, only had one bad DIMM in a matching set, followed their RMA steps and had my replacement very quickly)
I think what you're looking for is:  The Feitian ePass2003  (or some other token from their ePass line)   It costs less than a YubiHSM - Feitian sells them at 70USD for five pieces + customs, taxes and shipping It supports RSA, AES and 3DES with card-stored keys It supports the Windows CSP and has a PKCS#11 library It claims support for Linux, Windows and OS X It's a USB form-factor, about as large as your average USB-stick As a bonus it has a FIPS 140-2 Lvl 3 certification and is the only token that you can freely purchase with this level of assurance
* original suggestion removed due to not meeting weight/portability requirements, can be seen in update history *  As the first option did not meet your approval, here is another option:  The EON15-X Pro Workstation  (There is an ultra thin version, but due to how thin it is there is a limitation on ram installation due to inability to have the ram overlap like in a standard laptop)  This is built by Origin PC, who are known for their custom PC work, but this system is advertised as a workstation, not a gaming system.   It can be customized to fit your needs, and the chassis can be left as plain as you would like it to be.  Cost varies based on hardware choices, but just doing a "select every high end thing" test, it can max well above $5k.  Customization link is here
I would recommend:  Acer Laptop Aspire E5-553G  This is within budget restrictions @ $459.99 (199.99 @ off newegg until 2/1/2017)  8GB ram can be upgraded to 32Gb  Weight is 5.27Lbs  It does come with windows 10 (use a Debian/Ubuntu LiveUSB and install over it)  128Gb SSD (OS drive usually)  1Tb HDD (only 5400rpm, may want to upgrade to 7200rpm or another SSD)  Dimensions:  15.02" x 10.20" x 0.94"-1.19"  1 x USB 3.1 Type-C  2 x USB 3.0 (1 with Power-off Charging)  1 x USB 2.0  1 x HDMI Port with HDCP support  1 x Docking Connector  1 x Headphone/Speaker/Line-Out Jack
Actually, you don't necessarily need to upgrade the CPU. A PCIe 3.0 card will work in a PCIe 2.0 slot. However, you may experience slightly decreased performance. You mentioned that frame rates were irrelevant, so PCIe 2.0 shouldn't be an issue.    If you do want to upgrade to a CPU that explicitly supports PCIe 3.0, one of the most inexpensive options is going to be something like a i5-3340. Which will be a modest upgrade from your i3 3225.  As for a GPU I believe you will need something that uses the Maxwell or Pascal architecture for HDR (assuming you want to go with nVidia).   The GTX 1050 looks like a good option...   Supports HDR Has HDMI 2.0 Does not require an additional power adapter     In conclusion:   Go with the GTX 1050 and use it in a PCIe 2.0 slot. Can be found on Amazon for $110 or on Newegg also for $110. Or go with the GTX 1050 with an i5-3340 (if you would like to use PCIe 3.0, but it's not absolutely necessary). You can find the i5-3340 on Amazon for $175.     As a bit of a side note... You mentioned a "no-frills" GPU. I'm not sure that's really going to be addressable since you will need a fairly modern Maxwell or Pascal GPU for HDR support.
AM1 is not the best for gaming due to being an older technology with less capable CPUs, FM2 is newer. Personally, I'd go with the FM2 system, it is a more powerful CPU, and has built in graphics capability.  It also meets the minimum CPU speed and graphics requirements for the games you have listed. Though it will likely not be able to handle cutting edge gaming at max settings, without major upgrades.
Seagate Backup Plus Slim 1TB Portable External Hard Drive for Mac USB 3.0 Seems to meet your requirements. Its slim, coming in at  9.6mm tall.  I tried finding an SSD solution for you, but nothing would fit in that form factor. If your willing to settle on 512GB, I would recommend the AngleBird SSD2go, it is smaller... and substantially faster than any HDD.    The Seagate drive is a USB 3.0, and the Anglefire is USB 3.1 Gen2 10Gbit/s. These are my suggestions, I hope they help.
I'm looking for something similar to this myself; currently I'm using a CHIP from NextThingCo; you'd have to write the software yourself for what you want, but it runs standard linux.   Wi-Fi connection   CHIP can connect to two wifi networks (or provide one). There's no ethernet, however.  Audio output   CHIP has a TRRS jack  Push button to config wireless network through WPS   CHIP can program two of the gpio pins for this  An LED to show current network status   There's a shell script for that at thom-nic/chip-network-status-led  Optionally, an RJ45 connection for development through SSH   run an ssh server install a serial driver and connect it to your computer with a USB cable usb keyboard/mouse and video output via TRRS/hdmi/vga    Items:    CHIP: $9 + ~$5-7 s/h Power adapter: 2amp usb charger Recommended: small power bank or lithium battery Optional: case $2   This works fine for me with gmrender-resurrect, though I compiled it myself rather than installing from the repo. Currently I'm looking for something slightly more powerful that I can run BubbleUPnP server on as well, for transcoding (it doesn't seem able to start up).
For Commercial Use:  We have been using Open-Mesh access points at my work (specifically the OM5p-AC) and I love 'em. They connect to each other wirelessly, but I don't think they will connect to your existing wireless network wirelessly. I recommend that you buy two. Hardwire one to the router. The second one will connect wirelessly to the first one and act as an access point. Turn off the wireless radio on your router.   Pros: Seamless wireless network with high availability Cons: Expensive   Some people might not like that you can only manage these access points through cloudtrax.com. There is no local management interface. I thought I wouldn't like this setup until I tried it, but I was converted when I realized that all I had to do to set up a new access point was plug it in and enter the MAC address on the website. They do support OpenWRT if you really want to manage them yourself.  For Personal Use:  What you are looking for is called a repeater or range extender. I have tried the Netgear N300 and it works fine. Plug it in and forget about it. It has an Ethernet port so you can wirelessly bridge one wired Ethernet client. If you need to bridge more than one wired client, the TP-Link AC1900 has four Ethernet ports.  According to page 87 of the user manual, you can put the AC3200 in Repeater Mode. I have tried re-purposing routers as repeaters and decided I didn't like it because they turn back into routers if they get reset for some reason (it's happened a couple times due to power surges). If that happens, you get a network with two routers, and then bad things happen (DHCP conflicts). Hardware designed for use as a repeater is simpler and more reliable.
I ended up keeping the Intel CS125, and just returned the 4TB drive, as I technically didn't need that much space yet.  For now 2TB will be fine.  But after talking with Intel support, they suggested that it's likely a 4TB drive is just too much for it to handle, and would be incompatible via USB 3.  (I am still curious whether another 4TB drive might work, but I'm not going to spend more time trying to figure it out until I need 4TB)  The CS125 has been a bit on the slow side, but it does the job of backing up data fast enough, and really does use under 10W of power, even during startup (usually idles around 5W, which is less than my laptop uses when it's in sleep mode!)  So it's a pretty decent option overall with that specific caveat of the USB 3 not supporting a 4TB drive (other USB 3 devices work fine).  I didn't find any better options for the same price.
Yes, I was looking for the same requirement last month, I found e-con Systems who make cameras for NVIDIA Jetson TX1. They have a 360degree solution for TX1. I can see that they run 6 MIPI CSI-2 Cameras simultaneously. Please refer : https://www.e-consystems.com/blog/camera/?p=1709
My solution isn't a computer build. Its a more efficient way to transfer files to a hard drive.     WD 4TB My Cloud Personal Network Attached Storage     Using a drive like this, you simply plug it into the router and then share it with the users who are going to be copying files. Because its all local file copies, you should have a throughput of the gigabit ethernet.     Benefits  Can give users access to only the folder they need access too. Can use task scheduler or WD software to automatically backup folders. Since it's only a HDD/nic card... less likely of a bad psu killing it. If connected correctly, the drive can be viewed over the internet. Cheaper, in terms of running cost and initial purchase. Savings can go towards larger HDD size.      Anyway, I know this isn't the product you were after... but I think its the easiest solution to your problem.
The two bottlenecks of file copying are transfering from the external hard drive, and writing to the internal drive.  Everything else in a modern computer is much, much faster than the drives.  My recommendation is that you go to a local store and buy the cheapest computer you can find that has one or more USB 3 ports (USB 2 is roughly the same speed as a hard drive; going with USB 3 will eliminate the connection as a potential bottleneck).  When it comes to cheap computers, pre-built almost invariably costs less than building it yourself, unless you've got parts from another computer that you can re-use.
I did something similar last year and I used a TP-Link AC75 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router.   It has a WDS mode in which you basically connect it to another wireless network after which I think you have to disable its own DHCP in order for it to work as a bridge. I remember it worked pretty well but you inevitably get wireless lag.  You can check this manual http://www.tp-link.com/us/faq-440.html
I am using the Nokia Play 360Â° wireless speaker. It allows stereo channels (on each speaker) and it connects via bluettoth. No longer in production though. I cant find any equivilent in the market so far.
In a million years, I would have never thought that this existed. But.. The Sata Switch is a thing. This model, can hold 4 different SATA3 drives.       I read the product description and information, and it seems like it will do everything you are looking to do, for the cool price of 79.00.    Literally cuts the power from the unused drives, I'm assuming you have to power off/switch HDD/Power on in order to get this to work correctly, but its a pretty cool little device.      My only concern was that it's not a full 5/25 inch, so it would have to go into an old floppy drive bay... BUT it comes with an adapter bracket... SO it will fit in ANY case that has a 5.25 bay.
You might take a look at Logitech's C210 Webcam. It can be purchased on Amazon.com for about $23 here.  It fits all of your requirements:   Has a low resolution video output of 360p Can be used on Windows OSes Uses a USB output
So. I found this  SABRENT SBT-WCCK USB 2.0 USB Color Web Camera with Built-in Audio Microphone    Resolution is 352 x 288   I decided to keep searching for a lower resolution webcam So I searched for some of the first webcams to hit the market.   The first commercially available webcam was by a company named quickcam. The original QuickCam provided 320x240-pixel resolution with a grayscale depth of 16 shades at 60 frames per second, or 256 shades at 15 frames per second. Over serial port.    Once I saw that even the very first webcams were a better resolution than you are looking for... I've come to the conclusion that the Sabrent usb 2.0 webcam is probably the closest your going to find to what your looking for. Unless you make your own.   Hope this helps, and I'm honestly too afraid to ask why you need such a bad camera.
The closest things I've found is a 1500nit outdoor display: Samsung OM24E - 24" Model: OM24E 1500nit rating Samsung 24" Full HD LED-LCD Commercial Digital Signage Display, Black Most shops selling this seem to have this only on special order so once you order it, there's no going back.  Other than that, the best I've found are very expensive radiology displays. The cheaper versions come in black/white and/or grayscale. They tend to have poor resolution unless you want to spend a fortune. You still have to look closely to see if they actually have a higher than 500nit brightness, but I've seen many that do.
I'd recommend the SYBA SD-VIA-1A2S PCI card, $15 from Newegg.  It provides two SATA I ports, is universal PCI, and supports Linux.  It's got LBA-48 support, so it will work with drives larger than 137 GB, and should work with drives larger than 2 TB.  If you need it, it supports booting from attached hard drives (but not attached optical drives).  I don't have any experience with this card, but it's got good reviews on Newegg, including some from people using it to add SATA ports to older computers.
I love my Perixx mice. I have the MX-2000 at home and the 515 vertical mouse in the office. Neither have ever let me down. They are extremely comfortable, reliable and quite cheap compared to other mice on the market.
If you just want a basic mouse without twenty-seven buttons and assignable macros, etc etc: I'd recommend my HP BR376AA.   Five buttons: left, right, scroll, and two "thumb" side keys (which are mapped by default to browser forward/back). Excellent durability: I've had it for... five years? without it wearing out in the slightest. Around Â£40/$48, which is on the expensive side for a mouse, but the durability probably saves you enough to make up for it.
The best mouse I ever owned, and really the only mouse I've ever seen with a cult following, is the Logitech MX518. People buy these for $150+ because they were so reliable and no longer newly available. Its successor, the G400, is basically the same thing after doubling the DPI of its sensor and taking away the faux-impacted-metal design.  Speaking from experience, my MX518 worked consistently for 9 years until it developed the ole' "thinks a single click is two clicks" issue. Not bad for over 8000 hours of use for its life. It was a very sad day when I retired it and replaced with a Steelseries Sensei (only a year in but hey it's a decent mouse so far).
Considering your budget and existing hardware, a Nvidia GTX 1050ti will fit your needs nicely.   My recommendation would be Zotac's GTX 1050ti Mini. However, you will get similar if not identical performance from other non-reference 1050ti(s).  You can find Zotac's 1050ti Mini for $140 from Amazon or Newegg.    The GTX 1050ti fits your requirements:   Within your budget. Compatible with your system. You can play GTA V and other games at reasonable quality.   Bonuses:   CUDA support (GPU assisted rendering), if you use video editing software that's CUDA compatiable. Does not require PCIE power connectors. Its peak power consumption is <75W.     A couple things to take note of:   You should not have bottlenecking issues with your FX8350. Your motherboard supports PCIe 2.0, but the GTX 1050ti is PCIe 3.0. This wont' be an issue either. Make sure you have enough wattage headroom for additional components. Most builds do, but it never hurts to double check.
After some poking around, the closest I came to meeting your question's requirements was this: Black Aluminum MicroSD USB Card Reader works with all sizes TF card capacities.    Meets most of your requirements:   Fixed USB A connector Works as a micro-sd adapter/flashdrive Intended to be used for keyring-carry   Doesn't quite meet these requirements:   Metal unibody construction, the aluminum casing covers everything except the ends. (good enough though?) Does not include a large key-chain hole. You can get around this issue by adding a larger split circular key-chain on to the included one.     You can buy this MicroSd Card reader/flashdrive from Newegg for $6.  You can buy 25mm/~1" split circular key-rings also from Newegg for about $1.
Magnetic Znaps perhapz: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1041610927/znaps-the-9-magnetic-adapter-for-your-mobile-devic  There are similar products available on sites like DealExtreme and AliExpress, and also available for Android and any other devices that use micro USB or USB-C.
To answer your question:  No, there are no headphones(over the ear, on the ear, earbuds) in existence that cannot be: Blown out, have their speaker components damaged over time from being played at maximum output.  The same goes for high end speaker systems.  Running a speaker system at full blast puts stress on all components, which will lead to parts needing to be replaced.
In my opinion, to view code/text on a 4K screen without zoom (hence the "more real estate"), you cannot settle for a smaller screen size but go all the way up to a 32"  But you don't need to spend $1300 (which is out of your budget) for that Acer 32". Check out the BenQ BL3201PH which is a great 32" 4K at a bit more of a reasonable price point, but still a very good piece.  It was the only 32" on The best 4K monitors list from Engadget. And here is how they describe it:     The BenQ BL3201PH is a beast. It's the best 4K monitor you can buy if   you have room on your desk for its 32-inch screen. The biggest benefit   of a giant 4K monitor is that you might not need to scale your display   when running the monitor at its native resolution. That way, you'll   avoid one of the main issues plaguing 4Kâ€”third-party apps that look   ugly, blurry, or too tiny to use when Windows embiggens your on-screen   items.      Of all the large 4K monitors we looked at, the BL3201PH offers the   best combination of price and performance, plenty of connectivity, all   the right ergonomic adjustments, and a good assortment of features in   an easy-to-navigate configuration screen.
According to my sources (and I have a detailed answer on SU on the subject, including a handy graph and links to a spreadsheet) - 27" is *pretty" darned close to the sweetspot for PC use.  I game on a 980TI at that resolution (which is fine) but I've  driven 4k60 off much older/less high end video cards. I don't use gsync (which is mainly for gaming) and vsync is unrelated. Personally I don't think g-sync would be that useful here.  Personally I'd suggest the dell P2715Q. I have one and its glorious. Its the "sweet spot" 27" which is just right for the distance I sit at - roughly 1.25m. Its IPS (and this matters in terms of colour quality), and comes calibrated out of the box.   The wirecutter considers it the best 4k monitor of any size - and its reasonably priced compared to most options.   It has the essentials - pair of DP 1.2 ports (one micro and one standard) and one more to let you daisy chain (Don't daisy chain) , HDMI/MHL (4k30 only tho) in case you need to plug in a non PC device.  It also has a few nice things like an onboard USB 3.0 hub and the ability to turn off the powerlight when its in use. This sounds like a minor thing but its awesome.  It also comes with the dell stands - which are pretty much the best in the industry and let tilt, pivot and adjust heights to your preferences. You can trivially swap these out for standard VESA mounts for wall or multi monitor mounts, or a dell 2 monitor stand.   Fonts are readable (at 150% UI scaling on windows 10) and seriously crisp. What 4K content I've tested so far looks great too. I've basically ploughed through several novels and a few hundred stackexchange answers on this and its not fatiguing at all. I've gamed on it (though my 980TI sometimes wheezes during particularly demanding scenes)
I found This Runsy iPhone 7 case It looks like it uses a lightning passthough, so you won't need to carry a pesky micro usb cable around. The only limitation is that it does not work with headphones with lightning connectors.    Overall, it has a 4 out of 5 star review. Let me know if this fits the bill.
The product information page recommends the following fiber specifications:  9/125 um Single-mode fiber.   I would go with 3mm 10M 9/125um Fiber Optic Jumper Cable SC/UPC-SC/UPC Fiber Optic Patch Cord.    Meets suggested specs, and is less expensive than the cable you have listed.
Considering your budget of $350, some sort of a non-reference Nvidia GTX 1060 is going to be a pretty good option.  I personally have a GTX 1060 that I occasionally game on. However, I primarily use it for CUDA. I am quite satisfied with its performance for how much I paid.    The GTX 1060 meets your requirements:   Under budget of $350 Can play modern games with good quality   In Addition:   Your PSU meets the recommended PSU wattage. However, you will need a molex to 8 pin PCIe power or a 6 pin PCIe to 8 pin PCIe adapter. It supports CUDA, if ever you need to use GPU assisted rendering.     In conclusion:  I would recommend a GTX 1060, such as this Twin Frozr VI from MSI, which you can get for $260 on Amazon or for $275 on Newegg.
To directly answer your question of why they are different sizes, they are different models, and both are within the micro-atx specification.
I would say that for your use-case, go with the i5 6300QH with the PCIe-Based SSD.   Multimedia playback (Especially at higher bitrates and resolutions) will benefit more from a faster storage device. Faster reads from your disk will allow you to play and scrub through media without any buffering considering the much higher IOPS and lower latency. Programming and code compiling will also benefit more from a faster storage device. You won't see much real world difference in terms of compile time between the i5 and i7, but with only 8GB of RAM you may notice much better paging performance when building larger projects. From my experience, if you are just running a single VM, 4 cores/threads should be fine for most general-use VM applications (Programming in a Linux Environment for example). Again, you will notice more of a benefit from the faster SSD.   Some notes that you might want to consider as well:   The current laptop models you noted only has room for one 2.5" SATA-Based storage device, meaning you would have to sacrifice that 1TB HDD for an SSD if you were to go with a SATA solution over the PCIe solution. Much faster boot times (Both regular and virtualized). For a laptop, you will also notice much faster wakes from sleep or hibernation. All of your expected uses for the laptop don't really benefit from more threads (Although some may say more threads for Virtualization would be better).
Here is something that can address your situation, but you will have to be a little flexible, due to the fact your desired cable fix does not exist.  Kingwin HDD Power Switch Module 6 Switches for 5.25-Inch Bay  Idea is simple.  Have HDD/SSDs connected to each SATA port on the board, and have power distributed to each drive via the switch module.  You can manually turn any device not in use off, and of course turn it back on when you need it.
In a million years, I would have never thought that this existed. But.. The Sata Switch is a thing. This model, can hold 4 different SATA3 drives.       I read the product description and information, and it seems like it will do everything you are looking to do, for the cool price of 79.00.    Literally cuts the power from the unused drives, I'm assuming you have to power off/switch HDD/Power on in order to get this to work correctly, but its a pretty cool little device.      Only one sata cable goes to your motherboard.
I recommend the Corsair keyboard. Just the switch to mechanical is going to make a HUGE improvement to your typing experience.   Personally I have a Corsair K90 that I picked up around a year and a half ago and it's been a dream, but I have been eyeing the K70 RGB since it came out. (The main difference is the lighting and I think fewer macro keys on the K70)  The thing you will notice straight away is how much more responsive the keys actually are, not to mention it can handle more key presses at the same time. The Corsair software for setting up macros and configuring the lighting is also pretty decent. The wrist rest is also very comfortable.  May I ask why you list the backlight glowing around the keys as an issue?
Check this board "atmega328" with serial port around $2 / without serial port $1.5 on aliexpress   A wireless shield will cost you around 1.5$ also on aliexpress Or this little guy ESP8266 the newer one for $1.70  Here is a project about ESP8266    RFID reader around $1.70, 6 DATA PINS and 2 for VCC, GND from here
I use two Samsung UE590Ds, and would recommend 4k for both programming and games. I run Visual Studio and a large array of steam games.  Recommendations   Use 30" or 27" /w a close desk setup. I do end up zooming from time to time, however even with zoom I do save screen real-state (with all the other menus in Visual Studio).   If you go with 32" and plan on multiple screens make sure you have the desk restate to support it.  Use a beefy GPU, you look to have this covered with the gtx 1080.   I am running a 980-ti and on heavy action sequences my frame-rate drops. I am thinking that G-Sync would help but a better GPU would help more.  Do not use windows scaling, things that are not 100% windows scale look smeared. Also if you are using multiple screens and one is not the same resolution it causes havoc when you move windows across the screens.   Most programs (Chrome, Visual Studio, etc.) can scale on there own with Alt + scroll anyways, the apps do a better job scaling then windows does.  Use Display Port instead of HDMI, some screens support HDMI 2.0 spec (4k-60fps) however many do not. Check for VESA support, if you want to customize you desk layout VESA allows many 3rd party stand options for you. This help if you want a multiple screen setup. Demo the screen if you can first, try both TN and IPS panels.   My screen is TN, IPS screens do look a lot better (for example blacks look darker), I would have liked to view the monitor first to test this out before I purchased mine.  Make sure your screen has a good ms response time, screens that take a long time to respond do not render action (games) well and case many to feel sick after long viewing hours.   You may already know these things but they may be helpful if you did not. Good luck with your 4k plans.
I have bought Lenovo T460s in Sep 2016  Specs:   CPU: i7 6600U RAM: 16GB HDD: 256GB SSD (I have separately purchased a 512Gb Samsung 950 Pro M.2 NVME and swapped hard drives) Screen: 2560 x 1440 (non touch) Gfx: GeForce 930M (2GB) OS: Win 7 Pro Extras: Fingerprint Reader, built in mobile 4G internet, Smart card reader. Ports: HDMI, 3xUSB 3.0 (with always on power), Ethernet, Mini Display, Headphone/Mic jack Weight: 1.50 kg   Rational:  This laptop met all of my must have requirements and few of the optional ones.  Comments about laptop:  A little bit plain looking but solid and light weight. Port placement is IMO questionable e.g. HDMI is on the right and power on the customary left. Screen is good but not suited for graphics designers. Fn and Ctrl key functions can be swapped in BIOS. Lenovo provides fairly good management software suite without extra crud. Extensive theft mitigation security features built in - I have not configured them yet.
Since this has been bumped to the front page, I'd like to add a current generation laptop for anyone currently looking for a laptop. I'm recommending the  Gigabyte AERO 14 (Newest version, A$2699)  While it's weight is 1.89 kg, which is slightly above the OP requirements, it is significantly lighter than many other laptops with comparable hardware, for example, the Alienware 13, which weighs 2.6 kg.  The display is a QHD IPS panel, though it's somewhat dim, measured at less than 300 cd/m^2 by this review, because it's a matte (non-reflective) panel, it should be usable outdoors.  The CPU is the i7 7700HQ (2.2 GHz, 2.8 Turbo), the newest generation high performance quad core. While not top of the line, the only faster CPUs are the same, with only a few hundred MHz extra clock speed.  The base model also comes with 16 GB DDR4 2400, a 512 GB M.2 SSD and the GTX 1060 GPU (1280 CUDA cores, 6 GB VRAM), which is a desktop class GPU: Even at maximum detail settings and native resolution, it should be able to maintain more than 30 FPS for today's AAA games.  Unfortunately, there is no Ethernet port, so the laptop relies on 802.11 ac WiFi, though you could use a USB to LAN adaptor. There are three USB 3.0 (Type A) and one USB 3.1 (type C) ports, as well as HDMI 2.0, mini-DP, Headphone-out jack and a SD card reader. I don't believe it comes with an optical drive  The grey version linked looks fairly standard and minimalist, and while it is preinstalled with Windows 10, Windows 7 should be supported
SanDisk Sansa Clip+    $50 for 4gb and $100 for 8gb anyway both have SDcard slot. MicroSD card slot. Robust file support. FM radio and recording. Rechargeable battery lasts up to 15 hours. MP3, WMA, Secure WMA, FLAC.   I tried it before the sound quality really good.   Edit: The maximum Memory size MicroSD card is 16GB according to this article  Or Sandisk Fuze      The Fuze and all SanDisk's players (Fuze+ included) will work well   with cards up to 32GB. You can hack the newer 64GB cards (which are a   new format, SDXC or exFAT) by re-formatting to FAT32 and use them too,   but it isn't officially sanctioned by SanDisk (or any manufacturer).   Resource link  You can change the firmware from here to unlock the number of files + to run 64GB external SDcard
I would go with the following:  FiiO X1 High Resolution Digital Lossless Media Player  Professional quality Texas Instrument PCM5142 DAC and Intersil ISL28291 OP amp  Bright and easy to read 2" color LCD display. Custom user interface with color themes  Durable lightweight aluminum chassis, metallic buttons with concentric grooves, scroll wheel of textured rubber  Internal 1700mAh battery for over 12 hours of use on a full charge. Charges through micro USB port  MicroSD slot that supports SDXC cards, currently up to 128GB, large enough to hold your entire music library   Not too bad @ 79.99 on Amazon with prime shipping available.  The step up from that is the X3-II  Native DSD Support All new digital audio architecture means the new X3 can now handle DSD decoding natively, giving listeners access to this highly regarded digital audio format. Of course, the X3 also supports all of the popular lossless formats in your music library, including WAV, FLAC, APE, WMA, ALAC, and AIFF.  Dual Crystal Oscillators The X3 makes use of two crystal oscillators, one each for the 44.1kHz and 48kHz frequency multiples. This no-compromise design ensures the lowest jitter and highest precision for playback of music at all sample rates, eliminating all conversion artifacts.  Audiophile-Grade Architecture Utilizing the Cirrus Logic CS4398 DAC coupled with our painstakingly tuned low-pass filter, the X3 realizes extremely low noise and phase distortion. The X3's analog circuitry utilizes premium tantalum capacitors with minimal internal resistance for the best uncolored sound signature.  Again, takes up to an 128gb MicroSD card  @ 169.99 prime available, but only 3 available currently (as of this posting).
I got the N22 chromebook rather cheap with 32 GB and by the way some versions of this model are sold with Windows and 64 GB but I don't know how patient you are waiting for a Celeron processor and eMMC or slow SD cards to finish the job. In theory, if you are very patient you can install Linux next to Chrome OS (not chroot) to install VintualBox to host a Windows VM which runs iTunes and backs up to SD card. I ran a Windows VM on my new Asus Flip C302, but the Celerons are also VT-x capable but 4 GB RAM would be required for such a setup I guess. So if you can, better get a version which already runs Windows and get a fast and reliable SD card. I have never used iTunes on Windows and never backed up/owned an iPhone, so I have no experience with that, I expect Windows behaves the way I know it does.
First of all I want to clarify answer of your question, i check online features like this removable battery, SD Card slot, USB OTG, USB HOST and bugdet $100 to $150,i think this phone will fulfill your needs, see specs http://www.pdevice.com/product/ulefone-be-touch-2-specs, this phone has some great features like   Octa Core processor 64 bit mediaTek MT6752 Processor  4G Supported 3 Color option Metal Grey, Silk White Corning Gorilla Glass for better protection Average performance back 13 Megapixel Camera.   Even If you want to search more smartphone specification you can search manually one by one.
I would suggest: 2017 MSI GS63VR Stealth Pro-229 15.6"  USD$1999.00 @ Amazon.com  Display: 15.6" Full HD | Full HD eDP IPS-Level 1920x1080  Operating System: Windows 10 PRO  Processor: Intel Core i7-7700HQ (2.8-3.8GHz)  Graphics Card: NVIDIA's GTX 1060 6G GDDR5  RAM: 32GB (16GB x2) DDR4 2400MHz  Hard Drive: 512GB SSD (PCIE Gen3x4) + 1TB (SATA) 5400rpm  Special features: VR READY | Slim and Light Design | Steel Series Full-Color Backlight Keyboard   Yes, I know this is advertised as a gaming system.  Fact is, all a gaming system is, is a system loaded with high spec hardware.  What it ends up being depends on what you use it for.
If I understand the 802.11 specs correctly, then the 802.11ac variant uses the 5GHz band exclusively, thus the ASUS device should be what you are looking for.  Take a look at the table on Wikipedia. IEEE 802.11 protocols
Check this one for $24 HDMI Port, don't use Touch Pins, just connect it to power and HDMI port.   PAL/NTFS around $20 check this one   Or this one 48$ with VGA-HDMI-PAL/NTFS Port
For low power applications, Arduino boards are out. They are just not   designed for it. There is ancillary circuitry that continues to draw   more power than the microcontroller even when the MCU is sleeping.   Anyway you can ask in Arduino section to make your Arduino use less   power.   For example Arduino Uno use 42mA when running, while the deepest sleep mode, it still draws 31mA, There is other solution out there some micro-controller can run for a year on two AA battery, then check for the lowest WIFI shield.  NOTE: Some libraries designed to make the device use less power check that too.  What about this little guy Electric Imp WiFi SD Card Microcontroller
hmm..  Long range Passive RFID will cost you around $45 so forget about it..  Cameras to follow employee! science fiction, we are not ready for it yet..  GPS will not work perfectly inside buildings..  But there is a small idea for you and more simple!  I worked on AP devices from company called ubiquiti, These AP have the ability to work as a mesh network, there is an option to make a a Clint move around while the network choose the better WiFi AP for him and connect it directly..  I used to follow my friends inside this network by calculating the distance between them and each AP. So acttully you will know their locations from their Mobiles like how GPS work..  Throw 3 AP inside a company, it will work as WIFI and tracker at the same time, with a small script you can make this thing work..   There is a company working on that idea anyway check this link
I was going to suggest a phone with a good slide-out keyboard such as the Sony Experia Mini, but re-reading your question I noticed you are happy with larger devices possibly up to a tablet device.  I have used the Sony VAIO UX and it is pretty cool, the keyboard isn't as bad as many phablets, it's buttons feel similar to the Xperia Mini - I have used both to quickly recompile builds and push them to the OUYA when I don't want to walk over to a computer. By-the-way VAIO UX was replaced by the VAIO P - here is a pretty thorough review to give you an idea of a portable-Windows device's speed.  On the road I use a VAIO X - as it was the lightest computer on the market at the time, and it used the top-of-the-line netbook processor: Atom Z (2Ghz+Hyperthreading). It is larger, but has the bonus of 3G sim-card, and still travels well.  I Triple-boot with Linux (ubuntu 14), Windows 7, Windows 10 and I can hardly say which is faster. They don't "take seconds to respond to keyboard", but it certainly is slow. Powershell is OK (1 second response-time on keystrokes).
The Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ is said to be released in Q3 2017 and satisfies your requirements. It even supports G-Sync HDR. It'll likely cost around $1999 at launch.
Was looking at this also, found a USB NIC from Cypress, http://www.cypress.com/products/ez-usb-gx3-superspeed-usb-30-gigabit-ethernet-controller . In the datasheet it says   Supports IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tagging and 2 VLAN ID filtering; received  VLAN Tag  (4  bytes) can be  stripped off or preserved  So assuming there is a dongle using this chip and that the drivers makes it possible to configure the vlan id to filter out, looks like it should work.  /Olof
ASUS has a series of 15" mobile screens (with foldable stands similar to iPads) named MB167B, MB168B (2nd generation), MB169B (3rd generation) and MB169C (with USB C instead of USB A/B connectors). Additionally there are also models which end in B+ and C+ which are FullHD instead of just HD. AFAIK they're all USB 3, but also work if only connected with USB 2 (then only with reduced brightness/backlight). Not sure if you consider them cheap, but at least I don't consider them expensive.  You didn't specify the operating system you're using. So one more comment on these screens: One drawback is the lack of proper Linux drivers. There seem to be pre-compiled drivers for Ubuntu, but you'll find customer reviews that they don't work properly even on Ubuntu.  (That's the main reason why I never bought one. The other one is that 15" is already too big for my tastes. So I'm curious if other answers show up to this question. :-)
Try to get one of the predecessors of the keyboard you have. That would at least solve one of the two issues you mentioned.  I've got three of the X230-style ones (i.e. the direct predecessor of yours, not the very old IBM one which also has a Touchpad) and it's currently my favourite keyboard. I don't like the chiclet/apple style of the new ones.  They don't have your cable problem as the USB cable is hardwired to the device and can be folded into a compartment on the bottom side of the keyboard for transport. Unfortunately pressing the cable into the small slit from the compartment to outside too often damages the cable. So I usually leave it in that slit and bend it back from the outside into the compartment for transport.  But then again, they're not wireless either. (But I do prefer wired keyboards anyways, so that's no issue for me.)  The only other issue I have with these keyboards: The labels on often used keys wear off after a while (i.e. years of daily usage).  But otherwise I'm very happy with them â€” which is also the reason why I own three of them. :-)
If you are willing to adjust your price slightly, I recommend the HP OfficeJet Pro 8720. It won The Wirecutter's best all in one printer recommendation in September 2016.    Among the many features listed on Amazon:     Fast two-sided copying and scanning: Breeze through multipage documents with one-pass two-sided scanning and a 50-page automatic document feeder.    Now, the downside: Normally this is a $300 machine. It is currently on sale on Amazon for $165. It's slightly above budget, but I believe it's worth the extra $15.
You actually answered your own question with a perfectly acceptable hardware rec!   The USB Switch  acts like any KVM switch, press num-lock two times and it will switch over. Found this in a review...  From the reviewer on amazon - "Something I don't think anyone else has mentioned in other reviews (and that I discovered completely by accident) is that this switch will flip both of the USB connections from one computer to the other when you press Num-Lock twice in rapid succession"    You can create a little batch file on the desktop that fires the numlock keypress two times..    Set WshShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell") WshShell.SendKeys "{NUMLOCK}" WshShell.SendKeys "{NUMLOCK}"  This little batch should send the keypresses to the host and get the USB device to flip over.    Let me know if this fits the bill, or if you're looking for something else :)
After further research using the correct search terms (and digging deeper on each device as neither Amazon or Newegg are that good at listing all relevant information, I have come up with this one.  Epson WorkForce WF-3620 WiFi Direct All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner  $83.07 @ Amazon.com  Has everything you asked for, and is under budget.
I found a couple of options. I ended up going with a Hard Disk Drive Shipping Box - Slotted Storage Container Package from Tek Source Solutions. This ended up costing around $35 on eBay and they claim it will hold 20-24 3.5" drives or I can double them up to store 40-48 2.5" drives.  I don't have that many, so I can use this to store the few drives I have and maybe fill up the rest of the box with other similar sized cards, RAM, etc.  Another item I found was the HDD Paper Storage Box with Cover (5-Bay) from Brando Workshop. This was a modest $16 to hold five 3.5" drives.  Both of these are primarily simple cardboard boxes, so I'll probably leave the hardware in its respective anti-static bags while in the box.  What I wanted to get was one of the foam containers from ProStorage such as their ProStorage18, but it's $80. It looks like the entire container is anti-static, so I imagine I wouldn't need the drives stored in their anti-static bags if I got this.
I found a 4200 lumen projector on Amazon.com by EUG: EUG 4200 lumen 1080p wireless  It is compatible with a variety of different wireless casting programs including Airplay and Miracast.
For home networking, TP-Link and Netgear are the brands I've found most affordable and relilable; TP-Link tends to be a little cheaper and Netgear a little more reliable, but there's little difference between them.  On my home network, I've got a TP-Link TL-SG1005D. This is a Gigabit, 5-port, unmanaged switch - plug the uplink port into your Time Capsule, and the other ports will Just WorkTM. You don't need to do any configuration at all.  Amazon lists the regular price as $21.97, though it's currently on sale at $16.99.  There's also an 8-port version of the same thing available for $3 more, in case you want to expand - honestly, for $3 extra I'd recommend getting the 8-port version even if you don't currently need more than 5 ports.
Pretty much only lenovo seems to make keyboards with trackpoints.   I've been using one with a small trackball and it works pretty well. This specific one is made by IOGear. its not quite as awesome as a trackpoint but I find its very usable.     The keyboard has excellent travel and the keys are far enough to be usable even with big hands.   Its 2.4ghz wireless and has its own proprietary dongle . Its battery powered (Pair of AAA batteries) so no USB cables.   Has multimedia keys (if you need them) and the option of those little mouse buttons or a pair of "shoulder" buttons.
For whoever looking for a solution to the similar problem, I went with this club3d adapter. You will need to use SwitchResX software to force OSX to output 4k@60Hz. There are tons of online resources on how to create a custom resolution in SwitchResX, so I'm not going to post it here. Club3d is a bit more expensive than @NZKshatriya's suggestion. I would give it a try before buying Club3d.
I stepped on this problem some time ago when I tried arbitrary smartmontools commands and they refused to work on USB hard drive. After investigation of this issue it come out that not all USB to SATA/PATA adapters supports bypassing direct ATA commands to hard drive.  You need USB bridge that provides SAT (an ATA pass-through) commands. Chipsets that support it: ASMedia, Initio, Oxford, newer JMicron-JM20329, JM20335-39, Prolific PL2507/3507 PL2571/2771/2773/2775 ,Sunplus SPIF215/6, SPIF225/6. Jmicron, Prolific and Sunplus supports fully ATA pass-through.  Reference: https://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/USB
If you want an expandable, very reliable, pretty cheap backup phone I would go with an Samsung S5. Does not have the great specs you listed but it may be alot more reliable.
Seagate has recently released a 5TB drive for $85.  It's also 5400RPM, but that doesn't matter much these days, because if you're very performance-sensitive, SSD is the way to go anyway.
First, I'll be reviewing the reasons for price-differences on graphics cards with the exact same GPU chip, then I'll give a recommendation between the Galax GTX1080 and the MSI GTX1070.  There are indeed quite a few properties that can set apart different graphics cards and which can influence the price:   Clocking. This is the most obvious one. The OEM can adapt the base and the maximal clock of the GPU and give it more performance this way, just like a higher-clocked CPU would be faster. Normally more is charged for higher clocked GPUs and they can offer a couple of percents of perfomance boost as well. Cooling and OC. OEMs can customize the cooling for the chips and as such charge more for better cooling. They can also allow you to overclock their GPUs which usually requires good cooling. Better cooling means the GPU can maintain it's turbo-clock longer and it means you may be able to increase the base clock as well by using OC utilities, this increases performance and thus price. Noise. GPUs are notoriously loud and as such OEMs can try and minimize this noise. This may include using slower-spinning and / or more efficient fans which tend to be more costly. Additionally the OEM may add in custom board logic that turns the fans off if the load / GPU temperature is low enough, which drastically reduces noise. Of course, less noise is harder to achieve and thus more expensive. Optical Design. You may have noticed this trend, but everything on a computer has to have lights these days. This requires LEDs and the accompying circuit logic which costs money and also the placement costs designer time. So if you want a fancier graphics card, this will obviously cost you more. Brand Reputation. Some brands may have a higher reputation and / or better warranty conditions (eg EVGA). People may really want to buy their stuff and thus they can demand higher prices, whereas a company without such a reputation may has to offer lower prices to still get sales off.     Now for the demanded comparison. The Galax (aka KFA2) GTX1080 EXOC (1 2 (German)) has far less reviews and not a single from a high-reputation source (at least that I could identify), whereas the MSI GTX1070 Gaming X (1 2 3) has more reviews from more well-reputated magazines.  The GTX1070 will perform worse than the GTX1080 (mainly because the 1080 got more cores at a similar clock) and I expect the GTX1080 to deliver 20-40% more FPS than the 1070 (which is by itself ~5% faster than a stock 1070).  It's your decision, I expect both cards to have a similar price / perfomance point with the 1080 being off slightly worse, but of course $100 can also be invested elsewhere (for example if your CPU is pretty old).
My Immediate suggestion would be to look at one of Behringer's XENYX options, the 502, 802 or 1002 .  these mixers are 5, 8 and 10 channel respectively and 35, 55 and 57 GBP respectively. the links are below (I could only post two links,???)   If these options are too expensive then maybe you could provide a budget?? You also may need some extra wires with these as they take full sized aux cables (not xlr or 3.5 mm, you could use a 3.5 to full size adapter if that suits you better)  http://cpc.farnell.com/behringer/xenyx-502/mixing-console-xenyx-502/dp/DP29208  http://cpc.farnell.com/behringer/xenyx-1002/mixing-console-xenyx-1002/dp/DP29206  EDIT.  I know you said that these things have more functionality than you need, but at that price you can't really go wrong. it's very cheap for the actual hardware you are receiving. you may possibly need the extra tonal functionality at a later stage anyway, or if you want to add a little bit of bass to one of the lines!
You can use a service in the UK called SharedBand, but this is proprietary and I think I am correct in saying that you would have to have the two lines directly from the same company.  This could be used in conjunction with your 4G data connection by using both an ethernet connection from your two SharedBand routers and a wireless connection from your 4G mobile data connection. Your join the two with Windows adapter bridging mode if that works for you.  MacOS and Linux may have something similar but I'm not sure about it.  Edit, we had this at my business premises because we were right out in the middle of nowhere and it was awfully slow. had this put in, almost a 1.8x speed increase, so with fibre, you are laughing with that kind of boost. particularly if both lines run at 76mbps and 4G on top of that.  You might want to check if your computer's adaptor has the ability to go faster than 100mbps if you are using those kind of speeds though.
It is not clear if you are looking for a microcontroller (i.e. a chip) with wifi support, or a single-board microcomputer with built-in wifi. If it is latter, then you have plenty of options. One of them is the latest iteration of the Raspberry Pi series of single-board systems:  The Raspberry Pi Zero W is available for $10. It contains on-board 802.11n wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.0. You will have to add other stuff to get it going, but you should be able to run it headerless with nothing more than a 5V PSU and a 4GB micro SD card to hold the software.  One thing that I have not been able to establish is whether you can use the onboard Bluetooth to connect a wireless keyboard and mouse, or whether you will need to connect a wireless dongle to the (single) USB C socket, for which you will at least need a USB C to A converter cable. Starter kits are available, but this will increase the price considerably.  The Raspberry Pi 3 is more expensive than the Zero W (you should be able to buy one in the US for $35), but it gives you more connection options and it is what I would choose for development purposes. You get 802.11n and Bluetooth 4.1, plus 4 x USB 2.0 ports (with USB A sockets, so no converter cables), and also 100Mb/s Ethernet. Once you have got your software working on the Raspberry Pi 3, it should run quite happily on a Raspberry Pi Zero W.  Programming a Raspberry Pi using C/C++ is certainly possible, although most hobbyist use Python. The Raspberry Pi uses a version of Debian Linux called Raspbian, so a full stack of programming languages is available. Other operating systems are also available for the Raspberry Pi.  The CHIP is another possibility. For $9, you get onboard 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, and also 4GB of storage for software. It is not as well-established as the Raspberry Pi, and like the Raspberry Pi, you will need to add other stuff to get it going. However, you should be able to run it headerless with just a 5V PSU.  The important thing to consider with any of these systems is what you will need to add to make them usable, both for development purposes and also in the field.
It's hard to say without knowing what TV it is. Since it's an RCA socket, there's a good chance that it is simply coaxial S/PDIF, rather than optical S/PDIF (TOSLINK). If this is the case, you will need a coaxial to optical S/PDIF converter such as this. I would ignore the 3-pin connector, especially if the user guide doesn't say what it's for.
In case it's of interest to anyone, I went with a Samsung Galaxy Tab A with S Pen, 16 GB Wifi Tablet 10.1 Inch, and I am quite happy with the choice.
I'd suggest also looking for new or second hand Chelsio cards (T420-CR/T520-CR for optic OM2 LC SFP+ format, or other formats available, see their website) - they are quite frequent and cheap (well, as cheap as 10G goes) as used items on EBay, and very highly recommended - both pfSense and FreeNAS projects recommend them above Intel for 10GbE networks (as opposed to 1Gb where Intel is the standard). The -CR ensures they take the right transceiver, if you have an open hand on the transceiver format then Finisar SFP+ with OM2 LC-LC optic cable work trouble-free, also easily found and cheap on EBay or from networking suppliers.
Both Nas can do the things you listed pretty well. And since they are at the same price, I would probably choose Qnap with better HW specs. More important thing is that TS-251+ has HDMI that makes it a great multimedia server, you can easily stream videos to TV.
It's basically a choice of High perf + upgradability VS portable new machine.  The 2013 macbook is not upgradable but is equipped with a hi-res screen.  The 2011 however is equipped with a quad core CPU (8 Threads) which will perform way better in photoshop than the ULV CPU of the 2013 MBP. Moreover, the ram is upgradable, and the screen resolution is not that low (1400x900 or 1680x1050).  I personally think that the 2011 MBP is a proper machine that will suit better your needs.
Lenovo Yoga Tab 3, it also supports any pen technology. You can scribble and write on its screen. Good for reading, watching and writing.
It's points out the type of the RAM :  The "R" is for Registered which is usually used in servers. The "U" stands for unbuffered non ECC. The "E" stands for unbuffered ECC (not registred) The "S" for SO-DIMM, a format of DIMM's used for laptops :)   Those are the ones I know.
I realise that I'm a little late to the party and you may have already solved this problem yourself but thought I'd chip in with my two cents in case it would be of any use.  The router you are absolutely looking for is the Netduma R1, made by a small UK based startup and based upon a Mikrotik router board loaded with Netduma's own firmware.  This router uses a completely unique anti-flood algorithm that completely eliminates ping spikes due to other users on your network downloading, streaming etc and it absolutely works.  The router also allows bandwidth prioritisation per device, as well as including a unique patented geo-filter that allows you to specify the distance (radius) of servers you wish to play on from your home location when playing on dedicated servers as well as refusing users from other parts of the world if playing a peer-to-peer network game.  You can also specify maximum pings and either blacklist players by gamertag/PSN ID or IP address or whitelist friends who maybe outside your geo-filter/ping filters but you still wish to game with.  I have used the Netduma and can honestly say that whilst the promise sounds too good to be true this is one device that isn't actually snake oil and does actually work as advertised, In fact I would go as far as to say that this is the single biggest improvement to my online gaming I have ever made it really is transformative when configured correctly.  The features on the Netduma are light years ahead of what is currently available on so called "gaming" routers primarily because of the brilliant implementation of the software.  The only downside to the router is that it only comes with 2.4 GHz WiFi , however this issue can be circumvented by adding in an addition WiFi access point and turning off the routers WiFi signal, in my case I paired the router with a Ruckus Wireless R710 AP and the results are superb.
Alright, I found quite a few that meet your requirements, This Acer Aspire Stands out to me.    It seems to meet all your requirements, I filtered my search by SSD, 6th or 7th gen i5/i7 and either 8 or 16gb of ram.    This laptop comes with    Intel Core i5 7th Gen 7200U (2.50 GHz) 8 GB DDR4 Memory  256 GB SSD NVIDIA GeForce 940MX 1920 x 1080 display Windows 10 Home 64-Bit      It doesn't have any crazy features like eyeball scanners or anything.    If this one does not fit the bill, here is a list of all of my search results on newegg, Link.      I hope this helps!
I'm actually using the Razer Blackwidow 2016 Stealth Edition and I really love it , it's really smooth and reactive. Though my girlfriend likes it less than I do because she can't sleep when I play or type things because like a lot of mechanical keyboards it makes some noise, which is a negative.  This is what I found about the Cherry MX Red:   This is what I found for the Razer key switches:    So i'd say the yellow Razer switch is the closest thing to what you're searching for. I think it's a matter of taste more than anything so it would be best for you to go and try them out for yourself before you buy.
You should check out the Raspberry Pi HDMI Input Board. This is not really a recommendation, since I haven't used it, and there may well be better options. However, using an add-on card may well be the only solution whatever single-board computer you look at.
A Pocket CHIP Matt be fine but it has tactile switches so they are difficult to press. Also the corners aren't filed so fibre glass is always rubbing against your hand.
Some shopping websites are calling it "5-Pin to SATA Modular Power Supply Unit Cable". I don't think there's a name for the 5-pin connector.
A fully-wired PSU is simply a non-modular PSU, and comes with all power cables hard-wired. A semi-modular PSU has the essential cables hard wired and the other cables socketed. A (fully) modular PSU has all power cables socketed. To quote Overclockers:     Whereas non-modular power supplies come with all possible cables already attached, a modular PSU comes with connectors, giving you the freedom to use only the cables that you really need. There are two types of modular PSU, and the one you decide to go for will largely depend on your requirements and budget. A semi modular PSU comes with only the essential cables wired onâ€”usually the ATX 12V and EPS 12V, and in some cases the PCI-E cablesâ€”whilst a fully modular PSU comes with no cables whatsoever. A semi modular power supply offers a more affordable solution, whilst a fully modular power supply allows for ultimate cable flexibility at a somewhat higher price point.   www.overclockers.co.uk
The connector shown is a 5-pin modular power supply connector with a single side lock, possibly for a Be Quiet! power supply. They are widely available.  This example is from Scan.co.uk.  Note that most modular power supplies that use side-locking connectors have dual side locks.  Here is a Be Quiet! modular PSU with single side-lock connectors:    Pure PC
While there are DisplayPort to DVI-D Dual Link dongles, they appear to be quite expensive and require USB Power to function correctly.  This dongle from StarTech should support a DisplayPort input and convert to Dual Link DVI-D, which is needed for 144Hz at 1080p.  Note that the cheaper dongles available for DP to DVI are either Single Link or do not have the bandwidth to output at 1080p 144Hz.
I would have to recommend either of these two laptops. Neither of them focus on having a touchscreen display, fingerprint reader, HD webcam, or other "gimmick".    At a little over $610, the Lenovo IdeaPad 510s best fills your requirements.  Here's a rundown of the system:   i7-7500U (2.7GHz) AMD Radeon R7 M460 GPU 14" Non-Touchscreen 1920x1080 Display 8GB RAM 256GB SSD 3.7lbs (~1.7kg)     For about $900, the Lenovo IdeaPad 310 has more RAM and a larger SSD, at the cost of some weight, GPU performance, and screen resolution.  Here's a rundown of the system:   i7-7500U (2.7GHz) Integrated Intel HD Graphics 620 15.6" Non-Touchscreen 1366x768 Display 12GB RAM 512GB SSD 4.85lbs (~2.2kg)
For multimedia streaming, beware of the qnap.  They have recently removed Kodi support due to (apparently) licensing issues with Dolby.  Further, their default player (again due to the licensing issue) will not play or transcode ac3 or dts.  I'm not sure that you can even play an mkv.  Lots of unhappy people on their forums at the moment.  I had the same(ish) choice as you: ds216+ii or ts-251a.  I went with the 251a because of better harware and assumed support for the most popular audio formats and container.  I regret that decision and will likely return it in favour of the 216+ii.
Although I'm not sure it's really doable (if all 300'ish people will be concurrently connected) for such a low price range. But buying 10 cheap APs isn't really the way to go. Rather by few (or even one like this https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016E7ZSKO) high performance/high throughput APs.
I would like to add something to the answer.  There is confusion whether I am using AM2+ socket or AM3 sockets. Until today I still have a hard time believing that the same CPU with same product code have 2 versions.  This is very confusing. Hence, we can't know the socket just from the CPU code, which is currently Athlon II X2 240.  And this is where my main problem is.  Well if we want to know, the way is to use a software called CPU-z. From that software I easily find out that my mobo uses AM3 socket with DDR 3 memory.      Once I know the socket, finding the right CPU is easy.  Just go to https://www.cpubenchmark.net/socketType.html#id11 and there are lists of CPU  AMD II Phenom X6 is one of the thing that fit as NZKshatriya said.  Another I would like to add is that the CPU doesn't have several version. That one CPU simply fit on several sockets.  http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/answers/id-3365776/cpu-socket-versions.html#19455769  Still not sure.
As you I would upgrade the cpu and the motherboard. I think your cpu is the cause of your low fps. I myself have a i7-6700k and GTX 660 ti and I can play games like GTA V (120 fps) and CSGO (400 fps) with good full hd graphics. Also video rendering and blender etc.. aren't lagging or crashing.  i5-7600 is good for your use. For gaming alone it's not worth it but for your use it should be good. If you think that there is any chance that you someday want to overclock it I would take the K version. Price is almost the same on K as it is in non-K version. Motherboard does not really matter but take that one of the popular once.  You also need new RAM if you are going to upgrade from 1155 to 1151. If your budget is not enough take only 8GB for now. But don't take too slow RAM. You might regret that later as it makes a difference on video editing and because combining different RAMs might cause problems.  You did not say if you had a ssd but if you don't I really recommend getting one. I like video editing myself and gaming myself and with ssd I can really see the difference. Cheap ssd does not take much away from your budget if you buy your parts from good places.   For future gpu don't take the 1050Ti. That is hardly better than 660 ti. 1060 is a good choice but if it too expensive Radeon should be also good for your use.
Just to get a level of comparison:  The professional (workstation) videocards in the Nvidia family have usually the 1000 / 2000 / 3000 / 4000 / 5000 numbers, prefixed by the generation letter. They correspond to X40 / X50 / X60 / X70 / X80 of the consummer editions. So, for example, M5000M is roughly equivalent of the 980M.  Following the same logic, the newer Nvidia GTX 1070 will have as equivalent Nvidia Quadro P4000M.  But from the 9xx line to the 10xx line the jump was fantastic. For example 1060 is a something between the previous 970 and 980, while taking less power.  So what you are comparing here (M1200) to GTX 1070M is like comparing 1040 to 1070. You say what? There's no GTX 1040? Yes, you're right, that's how low that video card is.  You simply cannot compare them. So, if what you need is video processing power, there's no question.
Some solutions I've found so far.  They are all   Gigabit 16 ports sold WITHOUT 10" rack mounting kit   Intellinet 16-Port Gigabit 561068. L x W x H: 21.5 x 13.3 x 44 millimeters  Longshine LCS-GS8116-A. L x W x H: 216 x 133 x 42 millimeters  ZyXEL GS-1100-16. L x W x H: 215 x 133 x 42 millimeters  Buffalo BS-GU2016. L x W x H: 215 x 13 x 42 millimeters  Regarding the rack mounting kit, I think (hope) that magnaroute LLC could come to the rescue, especially with that kind of product: magnaroute LLC FX-17 Multi-Vendor Rack Mount Kit.  The other option is to pick a product that ships with 19" rack mount kit and adapt the kit (cut and pierce).
There are no adapters. The reason being that the PCIe version is dictated by the chipset of the motherboard itself. The ONLY way to go from PCIe 1.0 to 3.0 is to buy a board with PCIe 3.0.
Your question is borderline "Primarily Opinion Based", but I'll try to make my recommendation as objective as possible.  Considering your $200 budget. Your best bet will probably be a GTX 1060 3GB (mini). You can find one like this card offered by Gigabyte. for about $185 on Amazon, or for about $195 on Newegg.  Reasons for my Recommendation:   Fits all of your [measurable] requirements: costs < $200, supports HEVC and both Amazon and Newegg provide international shipping. Also, according to Passmark which provides benchmarks that I find to be reasonably reputable, the GTX 1060 mini outperforms both the RX460 and GTX 1050ti by a sizable amount.     It can be difficult to determine how "future-proof" this card will be. However, if you plan on playing games with similar performance requirements over the next few years, you should expect similar performance. As for providing decent quality in gaming, this can be difficult to determine as "decent quality" is subjective.  N.B.: You didn't mention the other components in your build. Before making your purchase, you should ensure that your PSU and motherboard are compatible and [ideally] you should check that your other hardware does not bottleneck your GPU selection.
This shouldn't be too hard, considering that these requirements are fairly basic... As long as you don't go with a mac (they're overpriced), you should be fine. I would recommend a Lenovo Ideapad Y700 $1000 - $1600 15" model, as they're quite good and not too overpriced, and satisfy the specs quite easily, though you won't get an SSD until the $1600 model, but that also has 1TB of HDD storage as well as the 512GB PCI-E-based SSD, 16GB RAM as opposed to 8GB, and an extra 2GB of Video RAM for the GPU, which is a GTX 960M.  To find these, go to Lenovo.com and navigate to Products > Laptops > Ideapad > Y700 Series.   With the 960M, you can also get some fairly decent performance if you're a gamer, though you won't be able to run games on ultra settings at stable frame-rates, it'll be all you'll really need for a laptop.
Personally, I would recommend Dell's New Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming laptop, more specifically, the 1,149.99 model. Yes, it is a gaming laptop, but it provides good performance at a relatively low cost.  Reasons for my recommendation:  Fits all Your Provided Requirements   Comes with a 64bit OS (Windows 10 Pro) CPU supports 64bit OSes: i7 7700HQ (4core/8thread) 16GB DDR4 RAM, upgradable to 32GB 15" Display - 1080p nVIDIAGTX 1050ti GPU w./ 4gb of vRAM 3x USB 3.0 ports Gigabit ethernet 2x Internal Harddisks: 1x 256GB SSD & 1x 1TB HDD     N.B.   It does not have a touch-screen, but you did not specify it as being absolutely necessary.
I use a Lenovo Yoga 700 for my school work. While I do not have the higher model it can have an i7 fitted. The laptop comes with 8gb of ram and has a touch screen.  In my experiance it is a very useful laptop, difficult to game on, it does not possess a fan. While this is down to the fact it is rather small and light, yet also the size of an A4 sheet.
I decided to go with the Ubiquity UAP-AC-PRO-US access point since my modem is a router and I can just literally connect to it.
AOC makes a range of USB-powered monitors.  They incorporate the GPU right into them, and should be backwards-compatible with any machine.  Pair this with a powered hub, beefy USB power bank (to power the hub), and dongled keyboard / mouse, and you'll have an amazingly versatile and portable setup.  Use a few pieces of adhesive velcro to fasten the hub to the battery bank.

According to http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/feature/pc-components/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080-vs-gtx-1070-vs-gtx-1060-3640925/, the 1070GTX has a TDP of 150W.  This is the amount of heat a component produces -- which with solid-state circuitry is conveniently the amount of wattage it draws, 1-to-1.  Doubling that (for two of them), gives you 300W.  If we assume that's all on the 12V rail (worst-case scenario), you're asking for 25A from your power supply.  Your CPU has a TDP of 91W, and lets go absolute-worst-case scenario and say your motherboard is 89W to make the math easy.  This is a further 180W of power draw, or 15A @ 12V.  I don't know if it's all from the 12V line, but this is the worst-case scenario.  A single rail (your PSU provides two) produces 30A at 12V, and a maximum of 540W @ 12V combined.  Going from my worst case scenario, you are at 300+180W, or 480W of a maximum 540W.  Antec quotes a 100,000h MTBF @ full load -- which means you can go bigger still.  Your PSU can actually provide enough power for your CPU @ 100% load, several HDDs & fans, and a pair of stock-clocked 1080GTXs.
I gather from your question that you have not worked with DMX controlled LEDs before. As a theater technician, I have used DMX controlled LEDs, and have to use a DMX controller like the one you are describing. Personally, I have worked with this one from Joyland to power up to 3 5m strips of RGBW LED tape.  To provide some more insight, I will assume you are using RGBW (4 color) LED tape. To control this via DMX (also called DMX512), you will need a 4 channel controller like the one I linked above. The controllers get a 12v power supply in, as well as DMX data through ethernet (RJ45) ports. This means you will also need a DMX512(5-pin XLR) - ethernet (RJ45) adapters. You can daisy-chain the controllers with Cat5e or Cat6 cables. To control them via DMX, you will have to assign addresses to the controllers control them from a DMX control device (such as a lighting console). If you didn't understand most of this second paragraph, I would suggest doing more research on DMX control or talking to someone who has worked with DMX control before.
I'm posting the results of my own investigation here since none of the previous answers quite did the trick (either because of weight or price).  The laptop that comes closest to the solution for me is this Asus Zenbook, which weights only 1.45 kg and has a 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7-6500U Dual-Core with 8GB RAM.  Granted it's not the most powerful laptop listed here, but it has still good specs and the and low voltage processor that should increases my battery life.
The 3 slot model is the one you need. With your hardware combination you will have one empty slot in between the two cards. The 4 slot model is only needed if you have two empty slots in between the cards.
Have a look at the ASUS N56JR.   64 Bit Windows or 64 Bit Linux (Ubuntu tested) i5 or i7 CPU (seems to depend on the region which one is shipped, the one I tested has a i5, the one tested in this video has a i7) 8 Gigabytes of RAM Full-HD screen NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760M and Intel HD Graphics 4600 USB 3.0 ports (2 on the left, 2 on the right) Built-in Gigabit wired Ethernet 1 TB HDD (can be replaced by a SSD)   Only downside to your requirements: It has no touch screen
You could buy some kind of mount, eg. Joby GripTight Mount (dunno how good quality wise is this particular model is, but it's good enough for the reference) and use it with any standard camera tripod.  Or you can check out some those flexible GorillaPods (it looks like little octopuses). Many times they are sold with similar mounts as the one above. The problem with these is, they degrade fast, but on the other hand, they are quite cheap and you can attach it to a lot of other things  You can also buy little tripods. While they last longer, they lack the ability to attach themselves to various objects.  In the end you got to chose what to use
I would try 4 dual band routers (i.e. they can use a channel in the 2.4Ghz range and one in the 5Ghz range at the same time), and set them up on different channels to minimize interference, checking for this. Go for the best routers you can get from your budget. Spread them over the room and connect them to an Ethernet switch. Try out different positions to get the most from your hardware.  An example of channels you could choose are channels 1, 6, 11 and 14 for 2.4Ghz as per this section and channels 36, 40, 44 and 48 for 5Ghz (I just chose the lowest non-overlapping channels allowable for the USA as per this). It should not matter how you pair those channels onto the different routers, so for example routers with   1 and 36 6 and 40 11 and 44 14 and 48 on 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz respectively.   You all set them up with the same SSID and password, but otherwise nothing special, just as you would for single APs. The clients will choose the best available AP (also switch between them transparently if necessary).  The router/AP you mention in your comment is a single-band 2.4Ghz one. I suggested dual band ones. One hint as to whether what you are looking at is dual or single band is that dual band ones (usually) have two antennas while single band ones (usually) only have one. But check the specifications! Dual band routers should perform as good as one router in one band, and a second in the other, so essentially you could two in one.  I think this could work, but no guarantees. The university WWAN where I study tends to get flaky in full large lecture halls (i.e. 300-400 people) and they probably spent quite some time and money optimizing it.
I am the OP: my advice to anyone with the same issue would be just get an old motherboard and do it.  I have a few hard drives, laptop and desktop IDE, which I would like to Secure Erase. I'm aware that other methods exist for removing the data, but this is the safest and most efficient, and it's the one I want to use.  I found someone else with the same problem here, and a reply said     It depends on the chips in the adapters (see hdparm docs).  Mine don't   support it, and the only one of them that I can warn you about is the   Seagate desktop expansion drive, the others have no branding.   In man hdparm it says     hdparm provides a command line interface to various kernel interfaces supported by the Linux SATA/PATA/SAS "libata" subsystem and the older IDE driver subsystem. Many newer (2008 and later) USB drive enclosures now also support "SAT" (SCSI-ATA Command Translation) and therefore may also work with hdparm.   However, I bought one which is support to support SAT, and reflected on the word 'may'.  I checked out https://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/Supported_USB-Devices. This is a list of devices which support SCSI-ATA Command Translation. I got a Gembird AUSI01.  It... didn't work. Just said 'erase prepare: invalid argument.'  I checked the adapter via USBdeview. It's genunine: correct chipset and device ID. It was able to work with smartmontools commands that I tried. It just wouldn't do Secure Erase, despite reporting that the drive could do Secure Erase.  So, I give up. Unless you have an opportunity to test this before you buy it, don't. Just grab an old computer... these days people will give them away for free.
Finally, I've found the right device. It's Fiio X5 3gen. It handles playing files in big folders (10000+ files) without any delay even if the random mode is on.  It has all features I wanted, sometimes it's even more than I expected (two card slots).   The only disadvantage I've found so far is that the device is quite big (it's a lot thicker than average phone)
I can just say about my device and can fully remommend it to your needs:  SanDisk Sansa Fuze V2 with rockbox firmware -- no touch screen, so no "unlocking"-problem at all, small, with rockbox about 20hrs battery life continuos play. The Wiki Page on rockbox.org seems to have quite outdated information, but in the last year or two there was new active development on CPU frequency scaling and power saving codes. With rockbox, battery life and audio quality is better than with original firmware, and can play many audio formats, also flac.  In another answer there is already a picture of the Fuze, so I don't need to add one here.
This RCA Tablet usually costs around US$35 at Walmart. Not sure how much it would cost in your country, but the price is much lower than the one you quoted, so maybe it is worth a look.  Its features:   7" screen Front camera  Bluetooth Works with OTG adapter + USB LAN adapter (I tested it). 16GB storage + SD card Crazy cheap Works pretty well for the price   I couldn't find anyone trying Linux on it, but it has an Intel Atom processor, so it is probably easier than an custom ARM processor.
Not too rough, if you don't mind ordering from China.  Check out this ELP-USBFHD01M-L36-120FPS on ebay.  It's unbranded, but I've given you the model number so you can find it elsewhere.  Currently, the cheapest place I can find is ebay, but that could change, as per comments.  It actually sports a Full HD CMOS USB Camera, which shoots at 30 / 60 / 120 FPS.  It's going for $45.26 US, plus 99 cents shipping, but it looks like it meets your specifications.  There's also this ELP-USBFHD01M-L36-120FPS for $49.62, which is actually the same camera from a different ebay seller.  Note that both of these have limited supply, so you may or may not be able to get hold on enough for your project.
My brother sent me this link: https://n-o-d-e.net/zeroterminal.html  A 3.5" Raspberry Pi Zero W based mini computer using an iPhone 5 sliding keyboard case and a 3d printed frame.  While is not for serious business, I think it's still worth the effort :P
I just came upon the GPD Pocket and the Gemini PDA. The first one is a little too big for you, but the second might fit.  Just to note: I found the HP Jornada 720/ 728's keyboad the best small keyboard for fast typing I had so far -- better than that of the popular Psion 5 mx. I could type almost normal speed on it.
While I know of no USB-C PCIe expansion-chassisesÂ¹, there are several Thunderbolt 3 options. In addition to the mentioned Razer CoreÂ² ($US 500, 1Ã—PCIe x16, 500W PSU), I looked into these two products when building my Macbook Pro Thunderbolt 3 eGPU solution:   The AKiTiO Node: $US 300, 1Ã—PCIe x16, 400W PSU The Sonnet Echo Express: $US 270, 1Ã—PCIe x8, no additional PSU   (There's also a huge number of Thunderbolt 2 PCIe expansion-chassis products, but those are almost certainly irrelevant to your needs.)  Of crucial note when researching this, be aware that the only differences in the above boxes are the length of the connectable card, and the bus-power provided by the PCIe slot. Although some may advertise â€œPCIe x16â€ slots, the Thunderbolt protocol limits the PCIe connection to x4 data-lanes, thus reducing every available expansion-chassis to approximately the same specifications, when it comes to the speed of the connection. (That said, every single one should easily support even a 10GigE networking card.) The only material differences are the cost, the size of the box, and the included PSU.          Having a â€˜USB-C PCIe expansion chassisâ€™ would imply a different, non-Thunderbolt proprietary protocol wrapping the PCIe communication into a USB-C â€˜Alternate Modeâ€™, which I can't see anybody bothering to do when Thunderbolt 3 exists; so the question as-asked is unanswerable.   I can also personally vouch for the Razer Core, as I love mine; and it comes very close to maxing out the performance of the absolute beast of a video-card I use in it.
You haven't mentioned which OS it is that you'd like to use so I'll split this up by operating systems. You did mention Windows Ink, so I presume Windows is your OS of choice but for the sake of completeness I'll offer the most popular options for both ecosystems.  Windows:  One of the most popular options of late is to use Microsoft's Surface tablet. This tablet could be connected to a monitor, so you can draw and interact with the tablet and it would be mirrored on the monitor. This configuration would match your ideal setup. The current latest and greatest is the Surface Pro 4 but the new Surface Pro is slated to arrive soon.   Surface Pro 1 and 2 used Wacom digitizers and styluses but Surface 3 and newer now use nTrig's technology for the pen input. Surface tablets can also take advantage of Windows Ink  You may also want to check out the Surface Studio, which is like a giant easel/canvas for drawing, although this doesn't fully match your ideal setup. The Surface Studio also uses nTrig digitizers.  There ARE other options out on the market that are laptops and have digitizers on their screens but they are difficult to find and lead to even more difficulty ascertaining what level of precision they offer.  macOS:   You can use an iPad Pro with Apple Pencil and an app called AstroPad to mirror a Mac's screen onto the iPad, whereby you can interact with it using the pencil and touch. AstroPad is designed specifically for drawing and illustration (in contrast to something like Duet Display, which just turns your iPad into touchscreen.) This is actually reverse to your ideal setup because Photoshop/Illustrator would be running on the Mac and not on the iPad. The iPad would just be a drawing tablet in this setup.  At present, the Apple Pencil ONLY works with the iPad Pro models. This might not change even in the future.  You can also get a cheaper, regular iPad and pair that with a Bluetooth stylus like Wacom Bamboo. I've seen this be a very effective tool for drawing as well but you lose out on tilt control. Also, the palm rejection is definitely subpar and may require you to wear gloves to draw so that your fingers don't cause accidental marks  Regarding styluses:  So far I have mentioned styluses from 3 companies: Wacom, nTrig and Apple  Many have their opinions regarding Wacom vs nTrig so I'll leave that choice up to you as the internet is full of arguments for and against each one. Each definitely has its set of pros and cons.   The Apple Pencil is the relative newcomer to the market but its inner workings seem to be very similar to that of nTrig's.  Personally I prefer the lower (maybe perceived) latency/higher responsiveness of Wacom digitizers/styluses over nTrig, having tried out both myself. There is no real perceivable difference between the nTrig stylus vs the Apple Pencil. I do know that the iPad Pro reacts to input quicker than a competing nTrig Windows tablet would (down to Apple's optimization I suppose)  From personal experience with all three styluses, I'd say Wacom is the most natural feeling, followed by Apple Pencil and then nTrig.  All three offer tilt support and similar levels of pressure sensitivity. But of course with an iPad Pro, you won't have to worry about drivers and troubleshooting software issues like Wacom and nTrig can sometimes cause on the Windows side.   As far as accuracy/preciseness is concerned, Wacom styluses/digitizers suffer from a minor amount of misalignment/parallax effect where the point on screen doesn't exactly match the tip of the stylus. This is really minor and isn't distracting (atleast to me). nTrig styluses seem to suffer from wobble, if you draw at slow speeds  Edit: Added links
This will not work as you intend, i.e. to improve performance/bandwidth on your LAN. This is not a limitation of the wireless protocols (You also would not see an increase in performance using two NIC's (network cards) on the same LAN), it is due to the TCP/IP:  For example sending a file from IP 1 to IP 2, the individual file must follow the same path for the functioanlity in TCP to work, that ensure the data gets from point A to B with integrity intact.  So I have a network card with 4x GBit/s ports, and they are teamed together (using the LACP protocol, not that it matters). When sending/receiving files from another server with the same setup, the maximum throughput is equivalent to 1 GBit/s (i.e. it maxes out at about 113 MB/s).  If you want better performance, buy some decent Cat6 cable with a colour that matches the walls, and run a length between your computers and ensure they have 1gb network cards (you can get those for $10 these days). It will save a whole lot of pain trying different technologies that will not acheive what you want.
Almost all always-on voice recognition phones are flagship phones. Unfortunately the smaller phones tend to be budget phones, which means they lack the always on voice feature.  The prices on flagship phones are usually far past the $400 mark but here's a list of recent Android phones that I should have always on voice feature:  LG V20 (around $700)   5.7" LCD screen  4GB RAM 3200 mAH battery   Google Pixel (around $750)   5.0" AMOLED screen 4GB RAM 2770 mAH battery   Moto Z Play/Moto Z Play Droid (around $400/450)   5.5" AMOLED screen 3GB RAM 3510 mAH battery   So out of all of these, only the Moto Z Play phones are in your ideal price range.
The brand and cooling systems are NOT the main differences here, so let's break it down. I will now attempt a Venn diagram in bullet point format:  Specs shared by both the MSI and Gigbyte models:   Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 GPU 8GB 8008MHz GDDR5 Graphics RAM Display connectors (3x DP, 1x HDMI 1x DL DVI-D)   Specs specific to MSI model:   Base clock: 1556 MHz Boost clock: 1746 MHz   Specs specific to Gigabyte model:   Base clock: 1594 MHz (gaming mode), 1620 MHz (OC mode) Boost clock: 1784 MHz (gaming mode), 1822 MHz (OC mode)   What you are paying the extra $100 for is not just the cooling system, it's also the pre-overclocked card. You are getting a card with a theoretical maximum speed that is 76 MHz faster.  Recommendation (TL;DR): If you have the extra money and want the little extra bit of power, go for it. But being that you chose the 1070 instead of the 1080, I'm thinking that little bit of power isn't very important to you, and probably not worth the $100 investment.
In my opinion, you are better off going with the Alienware R3 Laptop.  Here is a list of reasons as to why I would recommend it over the Dell XPS:   GTX 1060 will be much more useful than the GTX 1050 in both Gaming and Content Creation (Due to the more CUDA Cores and VRAM) An SSD/HDD combo will net you both fast loading times as well as much more storage space Better value, considering you are getting a G-Sync Panel and a higher end GPU for a lower cost than the XPS   Some Notes:  If you are concerned about color accuracy and believe that you will benefit from a better display, I would suggest saving up some money for a more professional monitor to use when you plan on doing content creation.  I cannot guarantee that either of the laptops mentioned will last for over 5 years.
I found one mouse that features a "Lightweight Aluminum Chassis". If the buttons are metal or some form of polymer I can't say.  But whatever the case the cyborg R.A.T. 7 is way over your limit of 40$.
What you need is something like this, maybe a cheaper one with two inputs, I couldn't find anything, but you might be able to using a little Google Fu.   https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/373759-REG/Behringer_MX400_MX_400_MicroMix_Four.html  You can then grab a couple adaptors, such as the ones linked below to convert your 3.5 to a quarter inch input and output, which then you connect your speakers to.  https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/851064-REG/Comprehensive_SPP_MJS_ADAPTER_ST_1_4_PHONE_PLUG.html  This breaks your budget by a couple of dollars, but you could shop around and get it from Amazon or somewhere cheaper like that.  EDIT: This is a mono mixer, so you will need a mono to stereo 1/4" phono adapter for the output, such as this one here from amazon.  I will look for an option that supports true stereo, but i should imagine this would fit your needs.
Considering your requirements, I'd recommend Dell's New Inspiron 15 5000 (5567) which goes for about Â£799 + VAT and delivery. From personal experience, Dell's laptops tend to be decently robust and are of good quality.    Reasons for Recommendation:  Meets All of your Requirements:   7th Gen Kaby Lake i7-7500U @ 2.7GHz 256GB SSD 1920x1080 FHD Display 16GB DDR4-2400 MHz   Meets of your non-Vital Requirements:   15.6" Anti-Glare Display 7hrs 35min run time on battery while browsing. Dedicated GPU - AMD Radeon R7 M445     SSD upgrades are possible, however they may not be within your budget since most larger capacity SSDs cost more than Â£75.
It would help if you told us why you want the server; what your goal is. Even without this knowledge, I will be able to answer your question.  Simply, no. The card doesn't advertise room for 6 GPUs. It advertises 6 slots that COULD be used for GPUs. Not only will it not support 6 GPUs, it will not support either GeForce or Quadro GPUs. It will only support Tesla GPUs (as described by this chart).   Now, I am going to assume that you are looking for this for professional use (as a server for a company, not home use for gaming or something else). If you are looking for something with 6 GPUs because you need that much power, check out the Nvidia VCA. It holds 8 Nvidia Quadro GPUs and features 20 physical Intel Xeon cores, and 256 GB of RAM. While it does not include internal storage beyond a 2 TB SSD, if you are dropping the money on that beast, buying a large NAS and the 10GBps network infrastructure equipment you will want to connect all these toys won't seem expensive.
You're honestly better off just formatting each hard drive individually. It would probably take less time to format them one by one than to search around for a good deal on a 10x hard drive supporting server rack. It probably wouldn't be worth the money at all to buy a new rack and barely worth it to buy a second hand server for the sole purpose of formatting hard drives.
Laptops over time especially as they get older generate more heat as they keep up with the latest OS and software which gets more demanding.3-4 years is the lifetime I realistically expect any laptop to perform comfortably.   cooling pads don't offer much. Look into  Opolar LC05 Laptop Cooler with Vacuum Fan that attaches to the fan vent of laptop. A little better than cooling pad.   Also make sure aero theme is disabled, if  you are using windows and check on CPU usage to find which processes are using the CPU most. Disable unnecessary services and programs that start up on boot.
I would recommend the Lenovo ThinkPad P50.  Here's an overview of the specifications:   i7-6700HQ (4 Cores/8 Threads) at 2.6GHz (Turbo to 3.5GHz) 32GB DDR4 2133MHz RAM 1TB SSD Quadro M1000M GPU $1920   The i7 Should be able to drive a couple servers at once, since it has 8 Threads. 32GB of RAM should be more than enough for multiple running processes. A 1TB SSD should give you low latency, fast R/W, and a large amount of data storage. The Quadro M1000M GPU should be fine for photo editing and driving multiple displays if needed. I believe there are 2 more 2.5" Bays, so you can add more storage in the future if needed.
If the cooling pad underneath is not sufficient- have you thought about the big and nasty option to stick a heat pipe in the CPU heat sink and attach additional heat sink to it. Probably you will be able to use the build in fan and no more than 3-4 ribs will have to be bend. There are also flattened heat pipes that will be easier to install. That might give you the additional 10-20W extra cooling.
Please check here I had some problem like this and this website solve my problem. I hope this could help you.
Single board PC with HDMI out is quite common but HDMI input is quite exotic even for standard PCs. It will probably have to add on card. There are many TV capture cards and the low end is analog video. Higher end are also with HDMI in, but are much bigger and power demanding. And this will diminish the single board advantages. Are you looking for webcam video modification on the fly or real HDMI capture?  HDMI 1.0 bandwidth is defined as 4Gbit/s (1080p/60 Hz) which could not be handled by Raspberry PI.
To answer your question: "Is it worth it?"  Probably not.  It depends on the specific value you'd get and the difference in cost. You can probably sell your Non-K chip to cover over 50% of the unlocked processor, likely even more.   If you're interested in tinkering for its own sake then overclocking can be fun and challenging - the kicker is that the only place you'll really see a benefit (aligned with what Alpha mentioned) is in synthetic benchmark software and CPU temperature values.  Maybe you are somebody who stands to benefit greatly from marginal gains in maximum CPU clock speeds. If this is the case I would suggest you scrap your current build and start anew with Kaby Lake or Ryzen (depending on specific application usage).
This article linked below mentions that pressure sensitivity has been implemented in Android since API Level 5.  I would see no reason why the S2 wouldn't have these features.  http://pocketnow.com/2015/09/07/force-touch-android-has-had-that-for-years
Like BigElittles, I'm a Plex fan, and my current preferred method for viewing my own videos and photos is Plex-through-Amazon-Firestick. If I had a smart TV (w/web browser), I may have accessed Plex via the web interface - I have Plex running as a service on my home server.  I also use Kodi; it's possibly more expandable than Plex, but certainly I think Plex is the more polished of the two.  Prior to this, I used a Western Digital WDTV box and an AC Ryan Playon HD Mini - both essentially the same thing: a little box that connects to your network, and/or local storage and plugs directly into your TV. Out of the two, I preferred the WDTV box. Most of these devices have a fully functional remote, rather than the simplified remotes that come with the Firestick/Chromecast. Roku 3 is the current offering from the supposed 'market leader'; I don't have any experience of these, but they are well liked and respected.  Given the rise of Plex/Kodi & Firesticks/Chromecast, these Media Players are falling out of favour, so should be fairly cheap to pick up. In fact, I still have both of mine, because the resale value of them is so little.  Furthermore, unlike Firesticks\Chromecasts and the like, they don't require a computer/server/NAS to provide access to your external hard drive. You connect your TV to the media player and your external disk to the media player and you are up and running.
That's a custom connector, specific to your brand of laptop. It should be possible to pull it off to reveal SATA power and data connectors underneath, which will work with your existing cables.
Yes it will be enough... I estimate that your rig will consume 350W under load, in which case you would need a PSU that handles 400-450W to allow for a little headroom. So you have that...  However, the PSU won't be as efficient as it could be, and it doesn't allow for any growth. Maximum efficiency is usually under 40-70% (depending on PSU model) so yours would usually be in the 70-100% bracket.   So if you want to make do, your current PSU will suffice. If you want to plan for the future, perhaps invest in a decent 600W+ PSU.
Get yourself a decent power supply from the likes of Seasonic or Corsair. The Corsair RM550x would do just fine.   You have high end components, make sure you have a good power supply. It's important to make sure the PSU supports all the C states from the CPU.
Yes, graphics card usually support some low level basic display mode that is supported by most OS installers. As the motherboard is the interconnect for all components you might not want to spend too little but you certainly don't need WiFi, BT etc.. You need to make the decision. It should. You could try to crosscheck with some of the many calculators available from power supply vendors. In addition PCPartPicker gives a rough estimate. As for future additions it would depend on what and how much. Personally I'd use a classic air cooler and your current list is missing case fans.
have a look at the  http://www.targus.com/us/universal-usb-3_0-dv-docking-station-acp70usz  I think you are looking for port replicator or docking station. It is useful for laptops/tablets but for fixed PC the cable ties/velcro is better option. And probably a box to put the cables in ;)
They look identical with different manufacturers only. If you found the RPM differences I could tell you a little bit more.
If possible, try to not hold the smartphone between your hands. That also blocks some of the signal. Otherwise you could try to mount external antennas to your drone if you could reach the antenna connectors on the PCB. Do know that adding antennas to the drone might result in less stability.
You could try the Lenovo P2.   Great phone with great battery life and not draining the bank..
They both look identical. Neither give information on the drive used in the enclosure. You might want to have an external drive that's either 1: has a drive with 7200RPM or an SSD for even more speed.   https://www.wdc.com/products/portable-storage/wd-elements-portable.html#WDBUZG0010BBK-NESN  If you have the money: https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-T3-Portable-SSD-MU-PT1T0B/dp/B01AVF6UO8.
It cold support it but i would recommend to give your PC headroom and getting something like 550W or 650w, most of those power supplies cost around 90-120 dollars.
Of the two you're looking at, I recommend the LG-22MT48DF.  It has audio output where the LG-24M38H doesn't, and the better color and viewing angle of the IPS display will greatly improve your movie-watching experience.  None of the uses you mention requires a fast response time.  Movies generally are played at 24 frames per second or 30 FPS, so any response time faster than about 30 ms is sufficient.  Office use is even less demanding of fast response time.  Contrast ratio is essentially meaningless.  It's a measure of the ratio between the darkest color the monitor can produce and the brightest -- but what really matters for appearance is the "black point": how dark that dark color is.  IPS panels generally have a brighter black point than TN panels, but I haven't found it to make a difference in practice: they're both fairly bad.  Monitor manufacturers get high contrast ratios by boosting the bright end of things to eye-searingly bright levels.  Once you've turned the brightness down from its marketing level to something comfortable, the real contrast ratio is much lower.  As far as I can tell, "flicker safe" is a meaningless marketing term.  LCD panels are inherently flicker free.  Blue-reduction settings such as "Eye Comfort Mode" are nice to have after dark (I use a software version called "redshift"), but during the day, you'll probably want to turn it off so the monitor's colors better match daylight.  There's nothing inherently harmful about blue light, it's just that blue light after dark causes problems with your sleep patterns.
For eye care, I would go with option 2.  Because it has better response time and contrast. For fast action, like sports and action/sci fy movies, you do not want to deal with lag. When watching video, I am mostly concerned with these.  For extra inputs, you can simply get an HDMI splitter or go to an aux port.    Just my opinion.  Love to hear what others say.
We have an industrial based solution for this.  Our SMS-530 is a SMS Alarm controller.  It works on ATT's 3 G network. It has 10 DI and 2 DO.  You can send SMS messages to the controller to control as well as monitor for Door and windows opening for security purposes.  SMS Alarm Controller
I have a couple of Linksys devices that enables SIP-calling from normal analog phones. There's numerous software that supports these protocols, so you can easily combine it with a tablet, PC, smart phone, etc.   Of course, you'll still need the SIP VoIP provider, but the devices works well and they're quite cheap. I found several on Ebay: http://www.ebay.com/sch/Linksys-VoIP-Home-Phone-Adapters/99269/bn_354182/i.html  I have the SPA2102, which has two phone ports. I've been very happy with it. I also have two single-port ones, but I don't remember what they're named.
8 ohms is nothing, you don't need an amplifier for that. The power supplied with a mobile phone is enough to drive your headphones. You'll blow out your eardrums with an amp. (250 ohm headphones and I'd recommend an amp, but you could still get away without using one at that level)  If you still insist on getting an amplifier for your headphones, you can get really any amplifier. Just make sure you don't go and max out the gain (I wouldn't turn that up too much anyway because it can end up amplifying a signal enough to hear some of that annoying white noise). Again, The decibels required to actually wreck your headphones will wreck your ears before you destroy your headphones.
Honestly,  I would recommend an SSD. A samsung 840/850 or whatever. You can get them in 2tb size, they are currently a bit expensive, but very reliable.  They have no moving parts to fail.  No heads, motors, or platters because of this they can even handle significant drops with no effect.  They have significantly more spare sectors, and way better error management than hard drives.  Beyond that they are screaming fast, and use much less power.    https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16820147371  Operating Temperature     0Â°C ~ +70Â°C  Operating Humidity     5% to 95%, non-condensing
To the best of my knowledge TV remotes use 1 way infra-red signals.     Remote systems that plug into your various devices   https://www.pulse-eight.com/p/104/usb-hdmi-cec-adapter  I have no idea how many you would need, but you could plug up to 4 into a $35 raspberry pi directly, or more than that with a powered USB hub.     or somehow wirelessly ping your devices to see if they're on, and   maybe even what input they're set at?   The raspberry Pi 3 has built-in wifi and bluetooth.  You might have to do some programming or find someone else who has already done it.  Here is some addition info I googled.  http://blog.endpoint.com/2012/11/using-cec-client-to-control-hdmi-devices.html  $ echo 'standby 0' | cec-client -s /dev/ttyACM0 $ echo 'on 0' | cec-client -s /dev/ttyACM0   If you had enough of these devices so that all your devices were visible you could control them all.  List all detectable devices:  cec-client -l   You could probably even write scripts so if one device turns on the other devices turn on.  The only downside is you have to DIY some of this. Maybe you can find someone else who has already done it.  CEC has many aliases see list below:  Samsung - Anynet+ Sony - BRAVIA Link or BRAVIA Sync LG - SimpLink Sharp - Aquos Link Vizio- CEC Hitachi - HDMI-CEC AOC - E-link Pioneer - Kuro Link Toshiba - Regza Link or CE-Link Onkyo - RIHD (Remote Interactive over HDMI) Panasonic - VIERA Link or HDAVI Control or EZ-Sync Philips - EasyLink Mitsubishi - NetCommand for HDMI Runco International - RuncoLink Insignia - InLink JVC - CEC Magnavox - Fun-Link Sylvania - Fun-Link Sansui - EasyConnect   One of dozens of options:  https://www.amazon.com/Inteset-External-Infrared-Center-Receiver/dp/B00J5NRWFO
Preface  This answer is likely more expensive than necessary for a dedicated device, but I'd see it as a justified purchase if you happen to also be in the market for a very usable and well built laptop.  You may also be interested in looking into wireless displays that connect to your existing laptop/desktop and have the bluetooth pedals control that directly.  2-in-1 Laptop  I can only speak of personal experience with one device in the 2-in-1 class which is closer to the $600 price point but there are cheaper models and you can always check for used. I really like my Dell Inspiron 7-series (7xxx model number depending on specs). It's 15.6 inch but there are 13.3'' models.   Comes with a stylus with in-body storage Decent I/O depending on your needs (hdmi + DP out, no USB-C) Decent display (1080) Good battery life Great all-metal build quality for the price Not much bloatware   If you can get one used or refurb for around $400 you're in looking at nearly 1/2 of what a new low/mid-spec Surface device would cost you (great machines though) and have all the benefits with two major drawbacks:   Form factor - Surface wins here hands-down, but that likely isn't important if the plan is to basically never touch it Pen input - the Surface pen implementation is awesome. I have a Surface for work and the pen gets a lot of usage from me as a non-creative professional. It's clipped to my shirt right now.
I ended up getting an Asus Zenwatch 2, as it has a mic and a speaker, and can record audio on the watch, without a phone nearby.  The app I'm using so far is Watch Recorder with Mic Zoom, which lets you record and playback multiple audio files on the watch without a phone.
According to the product page the Chromebook has a Celeron 3205U Dual Core clocked at 1.5 GHz. The other machines in your list (1, 2, 3, 4) start with Intel Core i5 processors of the 6th or 7th generation usually clocked about one GHz higher featuring Hyper Threading.  Cnet says the Chromebook has M.2 storage, which is better than the typical non-upgradeable and typically slower eMMC found in many other Chromebooks. It would be nice if the RAM was upgradeable too, 4 GB are not shabby but not plenty either. I'd rate the slow processor as a deal breaker though because I had a similar Celeron stutter at 1080p video playback (on a smaller screen so scaling was also involved). So the comparably big screen may not be useful at all. You may argue that you are not the kind of person watching 1080p videos on such a device and I'd mostly agree, but if the processor is already under high load in this scenario and most of the time struggling to keep up with running a non-ChromeOS OS (like just opening XFCE's or Gnome's resource monitor) then I wouldn't want to wait for it to get its work done when I actually need to be productive. Also these are usually passive cooled devices, which may overheat and crash or just throttle down even more (to get no work done at all!?). Core m processors (soon to be rebranded as Core i3) are a bit better, but they also have unusual CPU spikes when just scrolling through a website in Chromium, which I haven't noticed on mobile or desktop Core i5 processors. For a device of this size a 3270 mAh battery is a disappointment and I wouldn't recommend buying a non-USB-PD charging Chromebook, all the newer ones come with USB Type-C as per Google's new requirements (it's said to be a huge advantage in educational institutions to only have one charging connector).  N.B.: CB5-571/AURON_YUNA supports Coreboot UEFI payloads (not dual-booting ChromeOS this way though), but not all Chromebooks do, you'd have to use the legacy boot slot to boot an after market Linux distro.  Regarding my experience, I have:   A Lenovo N22 with a very similar Celeron, 2 GB of RAM and slow 32 GB of eMMC mass storage. It has very good battery life due to the low power processor that can get about 20 hours out the 4500 mAh battery on the lowest brightness setting. But I don't use it very much due to its underpowered processor, rather clunky, non-convertible form factor and because of â€¦ A ASUS C302 with touchscreen and backlit keyboard, Core m3 processor, 4 GB of RAM, comparably fast 64 GB of eMMC. Battery life is a bit worse due to the beefier processor and only 3900 mAh which results in 8 to 12 hours on lower brightness settings, which is okay because of the good screen. It also has USB Type-C charging, so I just need to pack one (bigger) charger for phone and laptop if I decide I'm going to need it. It's a very slim and sturdy convertible device for media consumption. A Thinkpad T560 with touchscreen and backlit keyboard, Core i5 processor, 16 GB of RAM, 1 TB midrange SSD, built in battery plus a small and a large replaceable battery, but no USB Type-C charging. I pull this one out of the bag whenever I decided that it's worth to carry around so much weight (it is most of the time). It's not as clunky as older devices like a T530 (which recently received Coreboot support if I didn't get it wrong) but in some crowded situations I left the 15" in the bag and used the smaller ASUS instead, which has â€“ hard to deny â€“ become my daily driver, even though I prefer additional performance of the beefier machine.   Summary: I'd stay away from Celeron powered Chromebooks if you cannot live inside tmux or other specific, very trimmed down setups (GalliumOS is already very nice). A cheap small Chromebook as a non-primary device may be okay, but consider saving the money and buying a better equipped device for double the price. Such premium convertible Chromebooks with touchscreens and backlit keyboards are rare, hard to get and even more pricier at the moment here in Germany, but honestly save your money or go for the pricier Ultrabooks/Laptops while we wait for more competitive devices. I found Chrome Unboxed to be an interesting read on this topic.  Edit: Some usually bring up video editing and make it sound like something unusual, resource heavy thing that you don't usually do unless you are an artist or trying to make money off of Youtube but just set the playback speed of video above 1x and look at how that changes resource consumption or just quickly seek to the right timestamp in a video. It's also not completely absurd to watch video this way see PAL speed-up.

Sounds like your hard drive died. That clicking sound is the reader head slamming back and forth.
I have the Dacuda Pocketscan which as previously a successful Kickstarter project.  It fits most of your requirements. Most, because being a hand-sized item, the power button is on the small side, about Pez candy size. The begin/end scan button is the larger round button on the top. Results are good, although most of my scans with it are newspaper quality and picks up the dark on the flip side of the paper. It's not the scanner that's poor quality, it's the paper.   This is the result of a scan of a day-to-day single page calendar, with better quality paper.   When the scanner is powered up, if the i-Device is turned on and the app installed, it takes the signal and asks permission to start, reducing the need to find the app on the device. Once permitted, pressing the button on the scan device begins the scan.  It does require reasonably steady hands and the ability to recognize overlap areas which are used to register previous passes of the scanner.  The age of the user and tiny button may disqualify this item.  What is objectionable with the item you linked as an example?
The upgrade is fine; the 8400 GS appears to have great reviews on Amazon.  However, with an increase in use of cloud services, I doubt that the 1 TB of space will be used at all; maybe 100 GB at the most, since you said that what he will be doing will be pretty much just browsing. Thus, I recommend getting a small 128 GB SSD, which go for around $55. SSDs make Windows considerably snappy, as for many computers the hard drive is the bottleneck for loading web pages. There won't be any complaining of slowness ;)
I have something similar for archiving and documentation purposes (BIM/CAD data for houses). There are some prerequisites you need to take into account:   You need a rugged notebook, and depending on the value of the data a 2nd one as spare parts. The mode of operation to keep it off for X years and to start it up after such a time is a no go. If your client insists, you have to insist more that this is not the way to go (see below) You cannot use a proprietary system for storage and you cannot use proprietary data formats for storage. If that is the case, you need to work out a data format and retrieval concept 1st. Also make yourself acquainted with archival storage formats such as PDF-A and seek for their equivalents in DB systems. Redundancy, redundancy, redundancy. Depending on the size of the data and if this is the only data to be stored/retrieved, you have to partition your notebook hard disk N times, where the Nth part is able to hold these data. Copy them N times. Use also more than one hard drive (better two smaller than one bigger. Use different technologies (one SSD, one HDD, if the notebook has optical drives - as rugged notebooks often have, use these too) Documentation, documentation, documentation. You need to keep the notebook together with extensive - written and printed - documentation about hardware, place of purchase, manufacturer, components etc. in one place. You also need to make very extensive ab initio documentation how to retrieve the data, where you provide a plan A, B and C of retrieving the data in the documentation.   Mode of operation:  As I wrote above, forget about opening the notebook in 7 years. Set up a periodic schedule once a year to start up the notebook (also have this procedure exactly documented in your printed out documentation).  The bootup should basically show any pending problems. If you get reading errors, maybe some SSD has started losing data. It's better to know that earlier than later, because retrieval may still be possible than when you get to know 5 years later.  You should never store the notebook with the battery plugged in. Also, the battery (Li-Ion) should be loaded only 70%. If you can get a notebook with LiFePO4 battery - get that. Life expectancy is 20 years.  Your VM proposal of a "life" backup system is also important. Do it. It's another kind of redundancy. A "hot backup" contrary to what I've described above which could be perceived a cold backup.  The notebook should also be stored in a safe place. A safe maybe, for the extra safety margin with temperature and humidity sensors (some capacitors tend to dry out) and keep environmental conditions in approved range.  There is of course more that could - and in case of real mission critical data should (as e.g. geographical dislocation of the two notebooks) - be done, but the above should get you going.
Measure the width of the HDD. If it is about 2.75 inches then it is a 2.5" HDD and so a 2.5" SSD will fit.  Some SSDs are thinner than some HDDs so they come with a spacer. Any non-electrically-conductive packing would do if you find the SSD is not held firmly, but I do not expect that to be a problem as they normally use four screws to hold them in.
For cheap solution I use a wifi router well supported by dd-wrt alternative firmware. Here you can find supported models database.  For more advanced, trouble-safe solution I use Ubiquiti UniFi - the AC-Lite model is really good.
I live in a large house and we have used range extenders in the past.  Currently we use an Edimax Pro like: https://www.amazon.com/Edimax-Dual-Band-Ceiling-Mount-Business-CAP1200/dp/B00UCKZ7SI  It's a little on the high end price wise.  We actually have it hooked up to an ethernet cable now but I believe it can be used as a wifi range extender as well.  Works great for us.  I want to verify: the Time Warner neighborhood wireless signal you refer to is a wifi signal, not a cell signal, right?  If it's a wifi signal, you should just be able to choose a wifi range extender that's the lowest price for the range you need.  However if you have walls and doors between the source, range extender, and your room (which is sounds like you do), then get one with a much larger range than what you think you will need.  Our walls made the wifi die down pretty quickly, and we had to position the range extenders along long hallways to get network access where we needed it.  If the Time Warner neighborhood wireless signal is a cell signal, then you need to convert it to a wifi signal first using something like a MiFi in order to use a wifi range extender.  That gets pricey.  Also, wifi range extenders really increase network latency, so playing games that aren't turn based will be frustrating.
You could consider a gaming keyboard, because they can take quite a bit of abuse and wear.    The Razer Deathstalker is the first keyboard that comes to mind meeting your specifications, being a wired chiclet keyboard with backlighting. The keyboard also has anti-ghosting capabilities which helps prevent mis-types. If you want to maximize your price point, you could also consider the non-back lit variant.
Unless I am mistaken, your goal is to get wifi where there is none. Now I assume from your question that you cannot put the wifi extender anywhere OUTSIDE the room (the no antennas part of the question). Assuming this, you would need to put the extender INSIDE of the room. The problem with that is there is no wifi signal in the room, so the extender wouldn't have anything to extend! If I am reading your question correctly, the only way to get wifi into the room would be to run an Ethernet cable into the room and attach a router to create your own wifi network.  TL;DR:. No, a wifi extender is not the hardware you are looking for.
I am using the same thing on Linux, but it should not matter. I just install whole system on USB flash and setup in BIOS to boot from USB  first.  Now it finds the USB on start, boots from it, sets the whole system, connects to net and does the usuall daily tasks. I can connect remotly, setup encription and connect internal hard drives encrypted, if I need so.   Those internal HDDs contains just5 encrypted data, nothing else, the USB flash contains the full system and can be used to rescue any USB bootable computer (nearly any nowadays).  As flash is not good for too many writes, I load as much as possible of the system to memory at start and I set the logs to RAM disc entirly, so th USB can be read-only. Takes more time to boot (USB is always slower than native connection), but I do not care. I can get the system anywhere else leave the computer with encrypted data discs only, not being able to boot. I can use the flash on any other computer to get my system working.  In Windows case it would mean to install the windows on the USB only (or start with some rescue flash and expand its content, then maybe copy it to USB disc. The disc probably needs to be market "bootable" and you need to set the computer BIOS to boot first from remote media - either as default option, or as backup option and do not make internal disc bootable, or just press propper key on boot to select boot media from list of aviable devices.  As I do not use Windows for many years (from when XP was hot new), I cannot provide step to step instruction, but maybe Windows are not so bad, that they would not enable "rescue system" to lay on USB media and to be customized ...
One possibility would be not to use the keyboard at all. The Tap is a new device that, after attaching to the fingers, allows one to write just tapping on whatever surface there is, the table, the sofa, even your (or so's) body.  I think it requires you to know the layout from memory, but the video shows a guy wearing some VR googles, so I think the actual keyboard (&layout) can be virtual altogether. I'm not sure if it's commercially available though, so this is just a suggestion.  source: The Tap (project homepage)
Personally, I don't pay so much attention to brand name when it comes to this sort of thing. I tend to like to look at benchmarks and reviews to get an idea of how well an SSD should perform.  You don't give too much details on your build, so it's hard to recommend one specifically, but I've had great success with the Samsung evo SSDs. I put one these into what was a crappy 4 year old PC and overclocked the cpu. It still runs competitively with brand new mid range laptops today.  If you want a fast SSD at a competitive price point, I would look into the Samsung 850 evo. The 840 series is also still quite good if you need to bring down the price even more. It has a Max Sequential Read of 540 MB/s.  This SSD will set you back a cool $100 for 250gb.    If you're willing to spend a bit more you could also go for a NVMe PCIe SSD, which have god like speeds (we're talking 3.2 GB/s sequential write and a random read/write that absolutely smokes hard drives out of the water). But a glorious PCIe SSD comes with an equally glorious price tag.
The answer is that it depends. If the one processor is faster than another, you can definitely undervolt the processor, or underclock it to slow it down. It would be dependent on how much you undervolt or underclock the processor, however. You might also want to note that you would want to make sure that your motherboard can support overclocking so you can ensure that you can actually mess around with the processor states and voltages.  Also note that the power consumption scales linearly with frequency and quadratically with voltage. So you can also reduce the frequency on a cpu state to lower power consumption as well, but it is more effective to decrease voltage because it has a squared relationship with power consumption.
SSD produce heat that is not a concern. There is no friction, and even in HDD where there is friction the temperatures do not reach more than 60 deg celcius. The brand does not matter as long as you do not buy at some funny retailer. What matters are not even the speeds provided - those are the speeds for sequential read and write. Please notice, that the more important factor is the IOPS, which will influence the overall responsivness and loding times. The sequential read/write are important only when you transfer larger amounts of data (GBs). I am going to reccomend for SATA connection Samsung EVO 850  and ADATA 550 Premier Pro simply because I have experience with both and they perform just great. But by all means, choose your own. There is so much choice on the market of the SSD which are all great, that you'd have hard time going wrong :) Should it happen though, you'd have a m.2 connection interfaced over PCI-e (!) I absolutly reccomend the quite new and cheap (for the quality) Samsung 960 EVO M.2 2280 NVMe. It's a beast, and it'll provide you a pure joy of speed - it has 3200 MB/s read and 1500 MB/s write speed at top, and     330,000 IOPS for read and 300,000 IOPS for write, which is at worst three times more than conventional SATA SSDs.
Another possibility is this new Apple keyboard, that's to be put into 2018 MacBooks. It has e-ink keys and stuff.  source: The Verge (news site)
The 16GB will help a bit, but you'd be better off with 16GB and a SSD. Seriously, a SSD is probably the best upgrade investment you can make.  Executive summary: Give it a SSD and 16GB RAM - this will not only be "beneficial", it will leverage your user experience to a completely different (higher) performance level.
You might have the most success with installing an actual non-electronic deadbolt bought at a hardware store such as Home Depot (if one is not already installed), such as in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vmOj4DII8I  And then hooking up a servo motor controlled by an arduino (or similar) attached an RFID scanner to lock and unlock the deadbolt.  One possible bonus is that your servo and arduino + RFID setup will be portable to other doors.  One retail example is the Kevo Convert by Kwikset, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YY0_IrvXGE
I accidentally found the answer to my own question. What I am looking for suddenly happened to appear in my Amazon recommendations (even though I haven't searched for anything like this on Amazon), and found you can find a lot of electric door locks by searching "open frame type solenoid" including this one, for example.
The motherboard is better the Z170. for the CPU: if you must also editing videos and graphics design take the i7, if not take i5
I did a quick search using the terms "gyro mouse," as devices of your description would have some form of internal solid state gyroscope to sense movement. One of the results can be found on Amazon with reasonably good reviews. I did not perform an exhaustive search, but I'd be confident to suggest that there would be similar products from other manufacturers.    Another option which may be more challenging to implement while at the same time, rather high-techy/geeky/sci-fi implemtation is called the Leap Motion Controller, also from Amazon. It uses a set of detectors in a rectangular puck over which one waves and/or places one's hands. Specific motions can be user-programmed for just about anything. I'm not aware of similar devices of this nature but then again, it's not your primary focus.
This is off-topic, but the build does seem compatible.  The i3-7100 is a LGA 1151 processor and is compatible with the Z270-A PRO (might be a bit overkill for an i3 that can't even overclock).   Hard drives work pretty much in any build, unless they use some special interface like an M.2 (the one you chose does not and is compatible).  You may want to refer to the motherboard supported list of RAM, but it should work fine in the motherboard.  The GPU is compatible with basically anything with a decent power supply (500W is enough) and a PCI-E x16 slot, which basically all motherboards have.  Anyways, I would actually recommend that you cut on the costs of the motherboard and increase the cost of the CPU, unless you plan to upgrade to another LGA 1151 CPU in the future. If you go with AMD, you can get the Ryzen 5 1400 which is much more powerful than the i3-7100, and the motherboards for it cost less. The Ryzen 5 1400 paired with something like this will cost slightly more ($20-$40) than your current build, but will perform much better and better fits the GTX 1060.
The Intel Pentium G4560 is a castrated i3 and hardly slower, maybe 10%. The Z-Board is a waste of money, especially if you do not overclock. RAM seems legit on first glance but you lose dual channel which needs 2 RAM sticks to get slightly more performance. Don't buy cards for around 200â‚¬ or more with only 3GB Video RAM, bad choice, rather go AMD with 8GB (470/570, 480/580) or Nvidia 6GB 1060. You have to  check if your stuff fits in the case.  Budget? The goal is to build a gaming PC, right? What games? Other tasks which the PC has to master? An SSD instead of an old HDD would greatly reduce all of your loading and startup times, makes the PC much more responsive but gives you (almost) nothing for gaming. Maximum and desired resolution (which is mostly GPU work)? Do you have some old hardware left? Etc. etc. Google and other tech/PC sites are a major help if you search a bit more, the forums there might also have guides which might answer your questions.  Edit: compatible? Seems so (if it fits into the case which it probably does but I don't know). Ahh and the mentioned i3-like pentium costs like half of the i3 or maybe even less.
Because you are requesting graphic design, I selected laptops that can take more graphics load over cpu load. I've avoided anything that relies on an integrated graphics card. I would recommend a SSD so that Adobe programs and files can load up quicker but that is just an added plus.    The cheapest option is an Acer Laptop Aspire:   It goes for 487$, has a NVIDIA 940MX and a i5 62000U. If you're not familiar with the intel letter system, the U means that it is a power saving core and, thus; it will have much less power that it's HQ, K, X, etc. counterparts. If you're looking for max savings this should do it, however, it comes with 8 GB of RAM so you may not be able to run too many adobe programs simultaneously without seeing a performance hit and the hard drive will likely be a bottleneck for laptop speed. If you go with this laptop you might want to consider buying a complimentary SSD to go along with it.  $487 at Newegg    The next is HP Pavilion (I've had great success with the Pavilions in the past):    It comes with a GTX 960 and a i5 6300HQ, and is a solid laptop although again, the hard drive might be a bottle neck (most laptop manufactures put nice components and a crappy hard drive in the laptop to bring down price but wow you with components). On the upside it is touchscreen, which might be a plus for art (probably not since you probably have a pressure sensitive drawing tablet if you do extensive graphic design) and the most amount of RAM of all the options at 12 GB. Be aware that the laptop is made of some crappy plastic, so the laptop may not be able to take the beating of an on the go active lifestyle banging around in a thin backpack and are notorious for splitting and cosmetic breakage. A solid option otherwise.  $780 at newegg MSRP $900    My personal favorite among the choices is the Dell Inspiron:    It comes with a i5 7300HQ and features 8GB of DDR4 RAM for faster "natural" operating speed (applications are loaded into memory). This laptop also comes with a 256 SSD which will make boot times, startup speed, and application startup absolutely glorious. Again the 8GB of RAM may get filled up if you open a lot of applications, but your SSD will be able to act as SWAP memory without slowing down your laptop extensively.  $784 at newegg MSRP $1,100    Additional notes:  If you go with the Acer or the HP, I would recommend turning on NTFS compression so that you can shift the laptop's operating load away from the hard drive and on to the CPU since both have decent processors (especially the HP). You should not turn compression on for the Dell option, because it has an SSD (In the interest of space, I won't go into detail about that reason here).
This MSI (from Amazon India) is a 17" and with the 8GB of 1070 graphic goodness, it is even more powerful than the 17" HP in your link. And the RGB keyboard isn't bad at all. But it is more expensive too.  http://www.amazon.in/dp/B01N6QUGZO/ref=sr_1_5?s=computers&ie=UTF8&qid=1496117351&sr=1-5    This one is also something worth taking a look at. It is similarly specced to the 17" HP (which is a lot better than the 15" you linked).  http://www.amazon.in/MSI-GE62VR-7RF-Apache-Pro/dp/B01NAKTV53/ref=sr_1_2?s=computers&ie=UTF8&qid=1496117103&sr=1-2
For quite some time it seemed as if the best bets would be:   Use USB instead of Bluetooth. There are some Si470x tuner dongles out there for which open-source drivers exist. I have managed to port a driver to Android and get raw TMC data from the device via an Android app. Build your own hardware: The Si470x chip is also widely used in the single-board computer community with breakout boards available. These, however, have an IÂ²C interface, so you would need a Bluetooth-IÂ²C bridge, most of which expose a Bluetooth serial interface. Challenge: the Bluetooth-IÂ²C bridges Iâ€™ve seen so far donâ€™t seem to come as breakout boards. Solution: get a Bluetooth-UART bridge and a UART-IÂ²C bridge, both of which are widely available as breakout boards. Once youâ€™ve pieced this together, again, you will need to write a driver, again based on the existing Linux driver. The protocol is not hard to understand and well documentedâ€”SparkFun has links to the relevant documentationâ€”so this should be doable for a somewhat experienced programmer.   Then, however, I came across something else: some folks out there had made some progress in decoding the proprietary GNS protocol, which the TMC dongles bult by GNS (one of the major players on the market) speak. The protocol is the same, regardless of the interface (USB, UART or Bluetooth), and by trying all possible opcides, I found another two commands. Iâ€™ve since developed a driver and am successfully using the device (mostly limited by the antenna setup). Both the Bluetooth and UART flavor have worked for me (I didnâ€™t have a USB device to test with).  Another major player on the market is Royaltek. Their devices seem to be mostly combined GPS/TMC dongles, which communicate both GPS and TMC status via the NMEA protocol. Thereâ€™s some progress on decoding that as well.
I am not from India, and INR prices don't translate very well in my mind, but this seems about in your price range.  I am not sure that this would be available to ship to you (since I am not from India), but it seems that Flipkart is pretty big out there, so hopefully it is.  Anyways, this is considerably less powerful than the laptop you posted, but seems to also be somewhat cheaper. The CPU is the same, but the GPU is a 1050 (not Ti) instead of a 1060. It has 8GB of RAM instead of 16GB. I have a laptop with similar specifications to the one listed (better only in terms of RAM), and it performs very well. If you want to game in 1080p without anything like VR and don't always need the absolute highest settings, this should be adequate.  There is a US version of this notebook that has a better GPU for a really good price, but I was unable to locate this on any Indian site.  Good luck finding something that works for you.
The Logitech G910 Orion Spark seems to fit your criteria. I am not a fan of the switches, but you might like them considering you want silent keys.  On Newegg, it is about Â£10 more than your budget.  It is definitely backlit, has removable keys, and has software to customize the lighting.  There are 9 programmable keys, which can be used for basically anything.
It's quite hard to find inexpensive tablets that also come with good touchscreen accuracy and most tablets will try and make you pay the price for nice components. That being said I've tried to keep these options under a 700$ cap and focused on fulfilling your request of decent memory where 8gb should be more than enough for pdf editing.    The cheap option: Dell Latitude ($390)    This option comes with a Intel Core M5 6Y57 which is relatively weak as a processor but should be more than enough for word processing. The tablet also comes with a 256 GB SSD which should allow you to load documents extremely quickly and should also help with boot times. As requested this tablet comes with 8 GB Memory which should be more than enough for PDF processing. I don't have much experience with these types of tablets so the touchscreen may have something left to desire although the $800 MSRP seems to suggest that you should have a decent touchscreen.  This option sells for $390 (MSRP $800) at Newegg with free shipping.    The premium option: Microsoft Surface Pro ($538)    The Microsoft Surface line is one of Microsoft's flagship products purposely designed to combat the style and premium feel of apple laptops and as such usually comes with a higher price tag. I've personally experienced these devices as one of my close friend speaks highly of the device and uses it for notes in his University lectures. One of my professors also used this device to draw out diagrams during his lectures on the screen and did so extremely well, I might add.  While it does have a i5-4300U processor (the U tag denotes that it is a power saving processor and as such has slower performance than it's HQ, K, X, etc. counterparts) it is still has more than enough speed for lightweight pdf editing. It also comes with a 256 GB SSD and 8GB memory. The added plus is that the stylus is integrated into the pad for easy storage and the pen itself has a very fine, premium feel to it. I should also mention that the screen has 2k resolution (twice that of 1080p) which will make editing pdfs much more enjoyable to your eyes.  At a price tag of $538 (MSRP $800) at newegg with free shipping this is a solid choice if you can afford it.
Yes, it is more than enough.  You should notice that this card is listed in the website as:     NVIDIA GeForce GTX Series (4xx, 5xx, 6xx, 7xx, 9xx, Titan)   It is also far more powerful than any of the Intel iGPUs listed.   Keep in mind that 2D-focused work stresses out the CPU more than the GPU, and that i7-7500u might slow you down a bit since it's a dual-core CPU. I'd recommend you a laptop with a better CPU and cheaper GPU instead of that Vostro if you plan on doing only 2D graphic design.  As for personal experience, I have a laptop with a i5-4210u and a GeForce 840m and it ran Photoshop CC flawlessly (even the integrated HD Graphics 4400 was able to handle it fine).
You might take a look at a company called Logic Supply. They make an array of pretty decent mini-pc fanless computers. They ask a premium for more memory though, most of their older model's top out at 8GB of ram and I found several that advertise a maximum of 32GB of RAM but wouldn't let you configure more than 16GB.   This one offers ECC memory, but their online configuration tool only allows up to 8GB of RAM, so you'd either need to talk with them directly or modify it yourself (which might void your warranty, not sure). Look around though, Logic Supply has a lot of models and each model has a lot of configuration options. If you don't see what you want, call them up and ask, they gave me good service.  Another possible contender is the Compulab Airtop. It comes in several different models, including one intended for server use with ECC memory and RAID.   There aren't very many companies making computers without fans right now. At a previous job I was looking for small fanless PCs for a factory floor and eventually stumbled into Logic Supply. I left before we'd done more than put a few units out for evaluation, but they ran flawlessly 24-7 for the 6months or so before I left. I had no problems with their sales and support guys either.   I've never had a compulab computer, but the specs look good and its gotten some good reviews. Thought it was worth the comparison anyway!  Do your research, and good luck!
I got an Acer Aspire V Nitro laptop last year for my wife to game on and it has been fantastic. It didn't come with a lot of bloatware, if we're doing normal internet/video/etc it will last 5 or more hours on a charge, it's screen has deliciously vibrant colors, and it runs all our games smooth and fast. I understand you don't necessarily need the ability to play games, but reaching that far means it should handle photoshop for years to come, right?  $1300 option: This model I think hits all your checkmarks plus a few of mine. Comparison Notes:   1TB hard drive + 256GB SSD. Windows and programs will install on the SSD so that you get really fantastic start speeds. If you haven't yet seen photoshop start on a PC with an SSD, you're in for a treat. 1TB is about as big as you're going to get stock in a laptop. 5.7lbs, a little bit heavier than the $850 option below. Probably still won't feel heavy though. Mine is 5lbs and it doesn't feel like a gaming laptop. It could easily masquerade as a cheap walmart special.   $850 option: This one's a refurbished previous generation model for considerably less. Comparison Notes:   This model lacks the SSD, which means it will take a little longer to boot and to open Photoshop. Still, it should do well enough.  The processor is the same i7, just 1 generation previous. Means that the $1300 option will have maybe 10% more cpu power. You won't notice it. The GPU is considerably less powerful than the $1300's. If you were playing games, you'd have to tune some of them back from ultimate settings. But, you aren't playing games and this will already be overkill for photoshop and illustrator. So that doesn't really matter.   Honestly, you'd probably be just as happy with the $850 option. In fact, if it had the dual SSD/HDD configuration, I wouldn't even mention the more expensive option.  Good Luck!
First, see the megahertz myth - you can't compare processors from four years apart based solely on clock speed.  Either machine would be great for iOS development. A couple things to note:   I use a 2012 13" Pro as a daily driver. I put a Crucial MX300 SSD in it and it's a great machine. You'll be able to buy the 2012 for significantly cheaper, and it'll hold value slightly better (all Macs hold their value immensely well). You need to be able to run the latest version of macOS for iOS development. Based on patterns, I suspect the 2012 Pro has 2-3 years of support left. A 2016 machine likely has 6-7.   If you get the 2012 Pro, buy an SSD along with it. It makes a huge difference compared to a hard drive.  Overall, I think it comes down to your specific situation. If your company is buying a laptop for you, go get the 2016 Air - then you don't have to open it up, and they get a laptop that's useful for a longer period of time.  If you're using your personal funds, I'd probably lean toward a 2012 Pro. If done properly, you should be able to sell it in a couple of years at a minimal loss. I bought mine in 2014 for $800, and could still get ~$600 easily. $200 + $99 for the SSD isn't bad at all for three years of solid use.
I use MacBook Pro 13" Mid 2014 - 512 GB model. It is slightly upgraded from the base model (CPU from 2.7 GHz to 2.8 GHz and SSD from 128/256 to 512 GB).  If you want upgradeability I think I would go for Pro 2012 as Undo said. I wish I could compare them but I don't have any experiences with other Macs.   2014 model is a bit faster than 2012 in terms of storage speed because SATA 3 (tops around 520 MB/s) is slower than PCIe x2 that 2014 model uses. Here is my speed test with stress set to 1 GB. On 5 GB stress the write peaks at 680 MB/s and then goes down to 390 MB/s.
Hostapd is hard to set up if you don't know what you are doing. I've had the same issue, I just couldn't make it work so I searched and found this beautiful script called create_ap. It can create a wifi network with a single command.  If that still doesn't work, you can buy some travel router (for example TP-LINK TL-WR710N, it is the first thing I found) and you can just connect your Lenovo with the router.  If you want to make it smaller, you can use Raspberry Pi as your storage server and in the best case scenario you can power it via USB that is on the router. Unfortunately, I can't find how much current does that USB have so I'm not sure if it will be enough for RPi and you will probably need a second power supply.  Raspberry Pi Model 3 does have wifi but using create_ap might not be that stable. I've tried create_ap on Orange Pi Zero (cheaper knockoff of RPi) and it didn't even create a wifi network. I'd rather go for router + RPi combo. That way you will have reliable wifi network with decent range.
I know it is not totally fanless, but Intel NUCs are pretty good for what you want. They aren't that expensive and have pretty good performance and upgradeability and they are small.  For example this one has maximum memory size of 32 GB, M.2 and 2.5" drive bays, 4 USBs. It doesn't have VGA though, instead you get HDMI 2.0.  There is much more of them here, or you can even build your own.
I wanted to find something like this a while ago. Unfortunately, it's not a simple matter of just getting the hardware, as the game developers would have to build support for these headphones into the game, and they haven't done so as the hardware doesn't exist to my knowledge.
This is but one example of my understanding of your objective:  Power strip Rotating Sockets UK    It has the added benefit of providing a pair (or more) of USB outlets. I do not suggest this is the single best answer, as my search returned far more results than is possible to post here.  Using The Google with the terms "power strip rotating sockets UK" may be the best way for you to find the item to best fit your budget and requirements.
At the level of components you want I would recommend a gaming laptop. Being built with high performance components meant for gaming, it turns out that like games; 3D modeling can also leverage the same high performance GPUs and CPUs available for gaming laptops that complex 3D games do. As an added plus, gaming laptops typically ship with anti-ghosting linear switch keys that make for a great typing experience.  I would recommend the MSI GL62M 7REX-1067 ($1,100) at Newegg    Key features on the laptop include a powerful GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4 GB GDDR5 and an Intel Core i7-7700HQ.  These components are much more than adequate at driving the latest 3D modeling software. It also comes with a full 16GB of DDR4 RAM which have faster RAM clock speeds than the usual DDR3 for faster application loading speed as well as a glorious 512 GB M.2 SATA SSD with sequential read and write speeds in the 2 GB/s range. This laptop ships with MSI's signature linear switch laptop keyboard.  This laptop is overkill for your purposes but at a price tag of $1,100 makes this laptop perfect for you and will hold you over for a very long time.    Additional notes:  I would like to mention that you're unlikely to find laptops that feature 6 hour battery life (even among power saving laptops) without compromising on the performance of the laptop. Intel, for example, purposely has it's U series processors which offer power savings at the trade off of cost.
This is the setup I have; 2 Dell 24" monitors 1 Samsung 49" tv (4:4:4 chroma) This works out well because the TV has almost exactly double the diagonal measurement, meaning that windows dragged across have the same size on the 4K as they do on the side monitors. I really love the setup for work.    I'm using a Radeon RX470 and it works pretty good, mostly. On occasion the screens will just kinda blink, and I don't know if that's because the video card is having trouble keeping up, or something else.    I'd really love to try a Geforce GTX 1070 for a week to see if it does the same thing.  One thing I'll say, it is really important to make sure that you have the right HDMI cable. We tried a '4K ready' Monster cable and it failed to show a picture. So we ordered one that can specifically handle 16GBps and that worked. It was also cheaper.
I found this when researching an answer to my question: Sony Digital Paper Sony DPT-RP1/B Digital Paper https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072DXXXN1/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_RXeozb5XNDYTN  It has most everything I envisioned except the camera. The price is ludicrous to me though.
I recommend you get the Jaybird X3. These earbuds come with multiple tips and fins in the box to make sure they stay in your ears. The X3s are wireless and can last up to 8 hours on a charge. The audio sounds great, there is a lot of bass and it can be tweaked with the Jaybird Mysound app to suit your needs. These earbuds are a bit expensive at 130 USD on Amazon but well worth the price.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M7NCT5O  Just in case you like your specs. https://www.jaybirdsport.com/en-us/x3-bluetooth-headphones/details-specs.html
I have experienced with both NAS, I would recommend you only QNAP.  Easy to setup VPN, SSL and Multimedia with your own domains.  Also, done speed test on the network from QNAP to Mac sent 1GB data:   1.QNAP: 432MB download and 345MB upload  2.SYS:  180MB download and 190MB Upload
You probably won't see a big difference with +267 MHz, but it wouldn't hurt to splurge the 45 dollars for the 2400 MHz variant. If you choose to overclock your RAM at any point, you'll see a bigger difference.  Unrelated, You might want to consider the MSI GL62M 7REX-1067. It is basically the same thing for only $1,100, significantly cheaper than the laptops you linked.  While it only has 16 GB of 2400 MHz RAM, it is already excessive for most gaming or video editing. 32 GB is an amount of RAM you would expect in a server. In addition this variant of the laptop has a 512 GB PCIe SSD instead of a puny 128 GB SSD.  The GPU is weaker than your choices, but not by much. It'll still be more than powerful to run VR and the latest games at full frame rate. (The screens aren't even 4k screens)  If you really want 32 GB, you might as well buy this laptop, and then spend 100 or so bucks for more RAM sticks and put them in yourself. (The sales site claims there are empty slots in the laptop for more RAM)  For your use the laptops you linked are way more powerful than you need for what you described your daily use for this laptop will be. So I'd advise avoiding overpaying for something you don't need.
Caution: 12@ 300w is 25A.  You need 4 gauge wire to handle that kind of load.  All the ones that are 300w or more require 16v-20v.  You would need to combine 2 to get a full 300w all the time.  You will probably need 2 of these devices to provide the correct number of amps to the PCI-E device.  Also 1 might overheat under load  You will need a molex Y cable simple to connect to the add2psu unit so PSU 1 turns PSU-2 on automatically.  Here is 1 option: (250w) peak (300w) http://www.mini-box.com/M4-ATX?sc=8&category=981 When operating at constant 160 watts or more forced ventilation might be required.

You can use normal WiFi Access Point routers for this.  The one I use is the Foscam N300.  It works great for both ends of this application.  Just don't use the WAN ports unless you also intend to create a subnet.  -- Unless it has built-in bridging that actually works.  I have tried several brands that claim to work but in practice they get confused.    If it doesn't have bridging, or if it doesn't work, then set it up as a normal AP and just plug into a LAN port on them, which is always internally bridged to its WiFi.   The router will think it has no WAN, but it should work for you.  If you use DHCP, make sure there is only one DHCP server on the entire subnet.    Or, as I do, just shut them all off and use static IPs, with the gateway address set to the closest router to the ISP.

Since, you're starting out with coding I wouldn't expect you to be using heavy Integrated Developer Environments, like Visual Studio + Resharper which can weigh heavily on the performance of your cpu and non-volatile memory storage devices. I've focused on budget laptops that should work fine for basic C coding. I've purposely avoided HDDs because they tend to be paired with higher speed cpus/gpus and become a huge limiting factor on budget laptops. I also curated laptops with 6/7 series i-# processors as they enjoy higher RAM speeds for faster application load-in (iex. loading in something heavy like adobe Photoshop).    Cheap Option: Acer Laptop Aspire  $440 @ newegg    Features a i7 7200U processor, 8 GB DDR4 RAM, 256 GB SSD. While the processor is weaker b/c it is a U power saver series cpu, you shouldn't find that being a huge limiting factor in this laptop. The laptop only has an intel integrated graphics card, so don't expect to be able to play triple-A video games on this laptop on max settings without getting abysmal frame rates.    Pushing the Budget: ASUS Laptop X556UQ-NH71  $800 @ newegg with MSRP $850   This laptop features a i7-7500U, 8GB of 2133 speed DDR4 RAM, a 512 GB SSD and most noteably, a dedicated GPU -the NVIDIA GeForce 940MX. With a dedicated graphics card, the laptop can handle more visually intensive processes such as physics in games (or a 3D rendered scene in a objective-C mobile application).  For double the price, you'd be getting a laptop that can last a little longer before you have to get a new laptop and should be enough to handle 3D/game programming if you choose to delve into it. You'd also have double the storage. For this laptop you're really paying for that secondary dedicated graphics card.  As a side note, you'd probably be able to play some triple-A games without your laptop crawling to a halt.
You wouldn't by any change be taking on developing apps for iOS -- the iPhone, iPad? I'm asking because I've personally only heard of Objective C being used for iOS apps.  This is important, because if are then you must have a  Macintosh.  If I'm wrong, ignore my answer and carry on.  Look, my original answer was deleted because it wasn't recommending a specific product. I understand those are the rules of this forum, but if my above assumptions are correct, them the information provided in my answer is vital, since buying anything else than a Macintosh (like the accepted answer recommends) is misleading and will only result in you wasting your money! I'm not a Mac person, but here, because rules, is a randomly recommended specific product that'll actually let you compile and run Objective C as you required.  You want at least 8GB of RAM.  On a side note: You may be interested in knowing that all iOS developers (that I know of!) are moving away from Objective C and switching to the Swift programming language.
Here's a couple options that I've found which might be appropriate:    Technet C016 ($15) Manual Focus, Manual LED Brightness, Positive review on amazon for scanning QR codes, 5MP  Logitech C615 ($33) Folded, flat design, Good autofocus and good movement, 8MP  Logitech C920 ($60) Same as above; folded, flat design.

Well, after another bout with search engines I had a stroke of luck and found this:  Acer Aspire Switch 10 V Slim Aluminium Detachable 2-in-1 laptop  with various discounts and offers it was for Â£200.  From what I'm able to see this gadget is designed so that it can be used as a phone, so while no one will actually use it as one, it meets all the requirements with style.  My wife loves it. She would prefer it pink, obviously, but silver brushed aluminium is the next best thing.   Also this is HD display model, which works better from battery life perspective,  but in case this is important, the Switch 10V line has several models, including one with FHD display.  Specifications, in case one would be interested and/or the link goes dead:  Processor           Intel Atom x5-Z8300 Quad Core (1.44GHz, 2MB Cache, Burst to 1.84GHz) Screen              10.1" (1280x720 HD Resolution) Operating System    Microsoft Windows 10 Home 32-bit RAM                 2GB Solid State Drive   32GB Storage Hard Drive  Not Included - 32GB eMMC Optical Drive       Not Included (Designed To Be Thin & Light) - External Optical Drive Available Seperately for Â£29.99 Graphics            Integrated (Intel HD Graphics)  Wireless LAN        Wireless (802.11b/g/n Wireless)  Bluetooth           Bluetooth 4.0  Integrated Webcam   Integrated Dual Webcam with Microphone (2MP Front, 5MP Back) Card Reader         Micro SD Slot  USB Ports           1x USB 3.1 Type C, 1x USB 2.0 (in Keyboard) Speakers            Integrated Sound System  Charge Time         2.5 Hours  HDMI Port           1x Micro HDMI  Warranty            Acer 12 Months Collect & Return Warranty  Battery Life        7-8 Hours (up to 8 hours with power management) Weight              1-2 Kg (This Model 1.15 Kg) Product Type        Convertible  Keyboard Type       Laptop Keyboard Detachable 3G                  Integrated 3G Module (Supports LTE/4G) Colour              Grey
You may want to consider the Microsoft Surface 3 LTE. I have one myself, and really like it. I specifically purchased it for it's built-in LTE capability, because I find looping WiFi through a phone or using a dongle awkward. Unfortunately, Surface 3 is no longer available direct from Microsoft - I don't know what the other options in your area are. You mentioned that refurbished or secondary market options are acceptable, so that would be your best bet anyway.  The other key feature is the fact that it runs a real OS, not limited portable-specific OS (like Android or iOS). I wanted to be able to run proper Microsoft Office applications on it, including VBA-scripted macros, which is something the portable versions of applications could not do.  There is a keyboard and pen available. I recommend one or the other, if not both. The keyboard and it's touchpad are surprisingly good for their thinness, and the pen is very nice for when you're walking around holding it in-hand.  I've included the specs here, just in case they drop it from the website, too. If at all possible, you'll want to get the 4 GB RAM/128 GB SSD version:   Dimensions: 10.52 x 7.36 x 0.34 in (267 x 187 x 8.7 mm), 1.37 lbs. (622g) Display: 10.8â€ 1920 x 1280 (214 PPI) 3:2 aspect ratio 10-point multi-touch Memory & Storage: 2GB RAM with 64GB storage, 4GB RAM with 128GB storage Processor: Quad Core Intel Atomâ„¢ x7-Z8700 with Intel HD Graphics Sensors: Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer, GPS in LTE-enabled models Ports: Full-size USB 3.0, Mini DisplayPort, Micro SD card reader, Micro USB charging port, Headset jack Camera: 3.5MP front-facing, 8.0MP rear-facing camera with autofocus, with 1080p HD video recording Battery: Up to 10 hours of video playback Audio: Microphone & Speakers built-in WiFi: 802.11ac Wi-Fi wireless networking; IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible, Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology LTE: Unlocked SIM (non-AT&T): UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+: 850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz 4G LTE: 700 (Band 17), 800 (Band 20), 850 (Band 5), 1700 (Band 4), 1800 (Band 3), 1900 (Band 2), 2100 (Band 1), 2600 (Band 7) MHz oth 4.0
It depends.  If you want to use ECC (error checking and correcting) RAM, you have to get the Xeon. If you don't want to use ECC, which is more expensive than normal RAM.  If you don't want to get your own CPU cooler, but rather want to use a stock one, get the i5-7600 because it is the only one from that list that can be shipped with a stock Intel air cooler.  In any other case the i5-7600K is the superior choice.   It has a higher TDP, meaning it can clock higher for longer. It has an integrated GPU (as opposed to the Xeon) which can be used to dedicate the Quadro to data-crunching. It can easily be over-clocked given appropriate cooling. It has a higher default clock than the other CPUs.
Well you really answered your own question.  You want the Moto G5, so really the option is to use the international version. This will work fine for you as long as you are going to be operating on a GSM Network.  IE ATT, T-Mobile, MetroPCS ETC.  It will not work on Verizon or Sprint based carriers.  The warranty will be different as well and you should contact the seller about it.  Buying the product from Amazon will give you good options for returning if it does not work.  Please see the link below to the product on Amazon.  Amazon Moto G5
I would start by saying that, as a person who had little knowledge about building a computer, but ended up doing exactly that, building is definitely the route i would take when building a Virtual Reality capable machine.  Couple of reasons for this:   You get exponentially more power for your money. I personally cannot bear to spend more than necessary, and market pre-built gaming computers generally have a large markup.   With that out of the way, Oculus actually have a recommended list of computers here on their site. One that sticks out to me in the kind of price range you are mentioning above is the Lenovo IdeaCentre Y700.  The first in the range of these models actually starts at $649, which should have plenty enough power to run VR games.  There is actually a reason why I would recommend this over your $650 Cyberpower PC, (some people are not going to like this), but it has a NVidia GPU. In my experience, most (not all) VR experiences run much better on NVidia cards, but don't hold me to that as I have no solid or documented proof, I have tried both and I personally preferred the NVidia experience overall.  Another point to mention is that this computer sports an Intel processor, but that AMD vs Intel is a very contentious topic, and I don't feel it is my place to start an argument on that. (I recommend Intel by the way :p)  I threw together a price on PCPartPicker, but for the ease of purchase and performance, I couldn't recommend the Y700 more, it seems like a really good deal.
Here's one:  Prime-Systems-Core-2-Duo-3Ghz-2GB-RAM-160GB-HDD-DVD-CD-Combo-WinVista    Seems like an excellent deal for the price. Barely more than a Raspberry Pi.    $38 and free shipping in the USA  It comes with 2GB RAM and is expandable to 8GB.  It comes with a 160 GB hard drive.    6 USB ports on the back and 2 on the front.  Firewire port on the front and back.  Wireless keyboard and mouse work great with the tiny dongle installed in back.  Ethernet port on back works great.  WiFi adapter works fine.  The dual-core 3GHz processor is good.  Motherboard is made by Intel.  The HDD is a slim 3.5" SATA.  The DVD drive is really fast.  Lots of other SATA ports on the motherboard (I didn't count but there were at least 6; maybe 7)  I have been using one to connect a second hard drive inside the case that I used for backups.    Display output is by DVI or VGA.    The motherboard and CPU cooler are ventilated very well.      Here is the best way to stand it for maximum ventilation whether on the table or under it.  Open vents on the left for the motherboard & exhaust fan on top:      Photo of the motherboard:    Photo of how the drives swivel out for easy access:
I was given multiple answers explaining how it can't be done for various technical reasons. I don't care! Tell me how it can be done, or better, how it is done.   Not gonna get far with an attitude like that, but I guess I'll tell you again that what you're looking for doesn't exist. It's impractical to a level where trying to produce and market a product that fills your requirements would sell one unit, and that unit would be sold to you. There is no keyboard that has dynamic displays that would change in response to stimulus from the Linux OS. Keyboard manufacturers have trouble getting little LED screens for "gaming" keyboards to play nicely with AAA software titles on Windows; thus, there's definitely nothing that exists and even if it did you'd have to build all those interactions into your Linux distro yourself. Here are the options that I see available to you:   Get a programmable board with different presets of keybindings. You may have a tough time finding something that works for you though, because a lot of these boards tend to be smaller and thus the multiple inputs per key scale as the number of keys gets smaller. If you look at an Anne Pro mechanical keyboard, for example, it's got 4 preset key combinations and one of those can be programmed as any layout you like. It's also got a ton of commands per key because it's a 60% size board. It is wireless but it's bluetooth, which I know you said you didn't want. Unfortunately almost all wireless keyboards that aren't $20 use bluetooth, especially the ones with the kind of programmable features you're looking for. Get two full size programmable boards and program one board for all of the primary key inputs and then the other board for all the secondary inputs and then buy custom keycaps for each board with only the symbol you want printed on them.   It sounds like you "need" option 2 because this issue is driving you nuts, and I get that. It sounds like what you "want" is something like option number 1, but that's never going to fulfill all of the standards you want to meet. You're either going to have to make a compromise here or get creative beyond my capabilities. Best of luck.
https://www.amazon.com/M5A99FX-PRO-R2-0-990FX-Motherboard/dp/B008B6ONXK/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1498491905&sr=8-4&keywords=asus+am3+motherboard  This should work fine. Personally I splurged a bit and got one of these: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008YDJHWM/ref=od_aui_detailpages01?ie=UTF8&psc=1  It's a pretty fantastic board, and they've come out with revision 3 since then which has M.2 SSD compatibility. I mean how much you spend depends on your upgrade schedule and whether or not you want to jump to ryzen later on, if you wanted to do that I wouldn't spend a ton on this board as your CPU is getting on in years (I rocked a Phenom II 965 BE until last year, loved that little guy). Both of these boards support my current FX-8350; this is relevant because your CPU's TDP is 125W according to the spec sheet on AMD's website, as opposed to 150W like you stated in your post. The FX-8350 also has a TDP of 125W, so both of these boards should support your CPU.  Careful on your RAM by the way. Whatever board you buy, you need to grab a .pdf of their mobo manual and make sure that your current RAM kit is listed in there for compatibility. Not every RAM kit is manufacturer-tested, so unless you want to end up buying new RAM and waiting another two weeks for shipping after a frustrating Saturday afternoon of troubleshooting, check the literature and save yourself the hassle. Best place to start looking is just to look up your old motherboard, and find the slightly updated version of it.
If you are using Windows and are on a desktop, you can use the line-in and microphone jacks and go to the audio settings to hear both devices. You would then have audio control over those two inputs as well.   If you have a laptop, you can purchase two ADC/microphone to usb devices and use the same method.   Right click on your sound meter in Windows and select Recording Devices.   Right click on your microphone/line-input and click    properties. Click on the Listen Tab.  Click on Listen to this device.
Alongside the option that @Jeff mentioned, There is the Blackberry Priv for only $219 new off eBay US.  This phone's bloatware is about as existent as Motorola phones. Also, defining bloatware for blackberry devices is somewhat complex. These devices do not show bloat in any form such as Samsung, instead the bloat is really slight overlay tweaks, which can be customised to a certain extent.  Performance wise, the Priv is one of the best phones I have had the pleasure to use, It just feels so slick and interruption free. It sports NFC too.  One benefit is the lovely screen, and QWERTY keyboard that sits behind the  screen, sliding up and down, and doesn't really add to the psychological feeling of bulkiness. The phone is only 9.4mm thick, actually .1 mm slimmer than the Moto G5.  I would definitly recommend the phone, and even more recommend trying one out if you can.
This doesn't hit all of your checkboxes, but I like it quite a bit so I'll throw in a recommendation for an Anne Pro mechanical keyboard. I picked one up a few weeks ago because the robber dome boards at work were hurting my fingers. It's a pretty great board, but I'll go through your concerns so you have a decent rundown. For background, I've also got a K70 at home (cherry browns) and I went with cherry reds on my Anne.  Must haves:   QWERTY layout = affirmative Full-size shift keys on both sides = affirmative Straight layout (i.e. no per-hand section or curved setup) = affirmative Tactile marks on F and J keys to assist with blind typing = affirmative Compact but not tiny: between 250mm and 350mm would be ideal, but I'm willing to go a little larger if it helps with the other requirements = This board can fit inside the box it was shipped in for protection and prevention of accidental key presses if you leave the bluetooth on, and then that box fits extremely comfortably inside my briefcase. The box is about the same length and height as my compact umbrella, but obviously a bit wider. You could definitely buy a case of some kind that would be more fashionable. I would say this keyboard is definitely smaller than what you stated you were looking for, and I was definitely a bit hesitant to buy it because of the size. That being said I have not found it to be a limiting factor since this isn't my primary board for home use. I probably would not buy it for that kind of use, personally, but it's excellent for portable use. No trackpad = affirmative Mechanical switches. I love the Cherry MX Red switches on my K70, something similar would be great = Comes with genuine Cherry switches in a variety of styles. Clearly separated function keys: so some space between ESC and F1, between F4 and F5 and so forth = Not gonna lie this one isn't so great. It's a compact board, and I'm still getting used to it as I've never had one before. I can definitely say that I'm getting used to the functionality and my speed is getting a lot better as time goes on. If I were using it at home as well as work it'd be even faster.   Should haves:   Wireless - Bluetooth 4.0 built in, also has a USB cable. Under $100 - Provided you can find them in stock they usually weigh in around $85. Basic media keys (play/pause, stop, next, previous, mute, and volume control) - Programmable keys covers this Regular section for Insert/Home/Delete/End/PageUp/PageDown keys - Negative   Nice to haves:   Not too loud - Depends on the switch type. I got reds, have gotten no complaints at work from people who have never heard of mechanical keyboards before. Wrist-rest - negative N-Key rollover - affirmative   Not important:   Numeric keypad. That is, I even prefer not to have one because it saves space, but I won't dismiss options that do have one. = negative LED lighting. = affirmative and it's pretty cool, lots of different modes, etc. Can be hardware disabled via keyboard shortcut. Programmable keys. = affirmative. Pretty useful for this board actually, it's got three different layout presets for different kinds of interfaces and has a fourth that is completely custom. I use a pretty specific database application at work so my preset will be based on streamlining how I interact with that program. Scroll-lock key. Who uses that anways? :D = It's there, I've never used it.   Stuff you should know:  They've got a subreddit with guides for everything to do with this keyboard if you decide to get it. Firmware update and app installation (needed for the custom preset, I haven't done it yet that's happening this week) are a bit of a pain from the looks of things, but not too bad. There is no physical power switch. The company says you can just disable bluetooth and RGB and that will put the board into a kind of sleep mode, but you'll notice on that sub that a lot of people install physical switches to kill power and avoid accidental key presses while carrying the keyboard in a bag and having it connected to a mobile device like your phone. The mod looks easy and I'll probably end up doing it myself, most people say it takes less than an hour.  It's not a perfect board but I'm liking it an awful lot. Amazon has the red switches version in stock here: https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Pro-Bluetooth-Backlight-Smartphone/dp/B06XW87X9D/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1498494412&sr=8-5&keywords=anne+pro+keyboard  Feel free to ask any questions if I missed anything.  EDIT: Just going to throw in a quick mention for CODE boards, as those are also highly rated and very popular for programming. They were the primary competition to the Anne Pro among keyboards I was looking at, and while I ended up not going with them they're a respectable company and may have something closer to the form factor that you're looking for, if that's an important enough concern for you.
If you need the best specs under $900 than i will recommend you this one https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MR82G0W?ie=UTF8  Acer VX 15 i5-7300HQ processor 16GB DDR4 RAM 256GB SSD Windows 10 OS 15.6 inch FHD IPS display 4GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti GPU.. you can easily upgrade its storage but you have to Acer support for HDD upgrade complimentary kit so they can send you.... The second one which i like the most is Dell Inspiron 7567 but if you are going to buy this one than i suggest you to buy it with IPS panel display instead of TN one that's what makes the laptop best graphic design laptop ........
If you're somewhat decent with electronics, you can build a simple passive mixer with just the appropriate connectors and some 10k resistors from the parts section of RadioShack (or whoever sells them near you):        The Grounds can all tie together directly.  The resistors prevent the inputs from being shorted to each other, so that none of them go into overload protection, and the technically weaker drive strength is still negligible for the line input that's going to receive this combined signal.  What you end up with is the average of all the active signals (even if they're actively silent), rather than the sum, but the only real difference is the eventual volume of the final mix, which you can easily compensate for by turning it up slightly.  What might be annoying about this is that if you unplug something, whatever's left will jump up a little bit in volume...unless you use normalled input jacks.  Normalled means they have switches built into them that are opened by the presence of a plug.  For example, a headphone jack might be normalled to some built-in speakers, but when you plug in the headphones, it opens that switch and the speakers stop.  In your case, you'd wire it to ground that input when the plug is removed, thus keeping it actively silent when you unplug something.  Then the volume stays the same no matter what's plugged in or not.    And, of course, you can expand this idea as far as you want, in terms of channel count, features, etc.:        This one adds independent volume and mute functions, and it has three inputs instead of two.  Only one channel is shown here; you'll need two for stereo: one for left and one for right, and the corresponding controls should probably be ganged as one stereo part each.  You might notice that the mixing resistors have changed from 10k to 2.2k.  The value really isn't all that critical - in fact, you can even make them unequal on purpose to pre-bias it one way or another - just stay above 1k for all of them and you're probably fine.  However, the ratio between them and the volume controls is important to get a decent audio response out of a linear (cheap) knob or fader.  (also called "B-taper", as opposed to "A-taper" for audio but is often approximated worse than what this trick does with parts that are cheaper anyway)  The inverted triangles are all connected together - it gets messy pretty quick to actually draw all of those connections, so just know that they're there.  Thus, the Grounds are all tied together as before.
Well, for this model I was able to find the URL of the long gone specs page via Wikipedia and the Wayback Machine did have a copy:     HDMI 1.4a with Stereoscopic 3D Frame Packing Format, Deep Color, xvYCC wide gamut support, and high bit-rate audio      Max resolution: 1920x1200
While I could not find the ability specific to the wifi network for the RT-AC3200 that @gabygg4 recommended.  I was able to determine that you can do this using adaptive qos on this router.  In fact on most of the RT series routers you can do this with.  Going this route will be a little more cumbersome if you have a client that needs to test on two separate bandwidths back to back.  To simplify that process you could simply set up some .reg files to change the mac address on the computer with a double click.

I think your budget is relatively low considering you will run computationally intensive tasks on it. So I would ignore battery life or portability constraints and just buy whatever gives you the most power both in terms of CPU and GPU for your money. This is also likely the reason you are seeing "strange" prices, for example those Microsoft Surfaces thingies often aren't powerful at all, but they are small, light and have long battery life.  Where I study there is a possibility to buy high-end laptops at a discount biannually, make sure you check out whether your uni has something like this.  Just as a random example a Lenovo Legion Y520 seems to be roughly in your budget depending on the exact model. It has a i7-7700HQ, GTX 1050 and up to 16GB of RAM. No 'business'/'workstation' quality, battery won't last too long, but probably as much power as you can get for that kind of money. There are similar offers from other manufacturers.
I've bought a succession of used high end Dell systems.  My current laptop is a Dell Precision M6500 with a Core i7-920XM processor, 16 GB RAM, mSATA boot/swap/home, 1TB and 2TB drives in the internal bays, and I've replaced the DVD with a caddy for a second 2TB drive.  1920x1200 screen, Radeon HD5870.  It will take up to 32GB RAM.  I like these systems because they're very easy to maintain and upgrade.  I'm rough on keyboards, so I've replaced that a few times, and I've replaced the battery.  I've had it since 2011, and it was used and a generation behind at the time.  Just maintain it; the most important thing is to blow out the fans with a can of compressed air every now and then.  These machines are cheap and plentiful on eBay, going for about $400 with an i7-920XM or i7-940XM processor.  It's easy to find parts for these robustly-constructed systems.  I've been very happy with it.  I run exclusively Linux (openSUSE) on it, and everything works fine.  They actually offer Precision laptops with Linux preloaded.  If your old laptop weighed 4.8 kg (10.6 lb), you'll find the Precision series to be light and fluffy.  It has a plain silver exterior with an understated Dell logo, except for the "Covet" version which is orange (and functionally is no different).  The only issue is that the processor is slow by contemporary standards.  It has a Passmark rating a little under 4000, vs. some of the newer i7 mobile chips that are up around 10000 or even 11000 (I've found that for what I do, which is a lot of photography, software development, and some video, Passmark is an accurate reflection of relative performance to expect, compared against a Core 2 Duo E8400 and i7-5820K).  My other observation from the Passmark numbers is that there was a big performnace jump from the top-end first generation to second generation i7 processors (the top second generation is around 7000), a significant jump to the third generation (around 9000, IIRC) and smaller improvements after that (the top end fourth generation is around 10000; the 5th and 6th generation no higher, and you have to go to a mobile Xeon to get any meaningful improvement, and that's only about 10%).  Dell has released newer Precision "mobile workstations"; the 6600 is based on second generation, the 6700 on third, the 6800 on fourth, 7710 on 6th, and 7720 on 7th generation processors.  The big downside (to me) of the newer ones is that they're full HD (1920x1080) rather than WUXGA (1920x1200); that difference is quite significant.  This is going to form the basis of a question I will be asking that's closely related to this.  Based on all of this, my recommendation to you would be to purchase a used Dell M6800 on eBay with your choice of processor and screen.  It's easy to upgrade memory (to at least 32GB; I'm not sure about 64GB) and storage with just a screwdriver, and memory and 2TB disks are cheap.  The processor is more difficult.  So if you find a good deal with a top of the line chip (i7-4980HQ, i7-4960HQ, or i7-4940MX) and the screen you want, I'd go for that first and worry about memory and storage later.  They offer these systems with lower-end i7 and i5 chips, so check carefully.  If a 17" screen is too big, you can go with the M4800, which is 15" but otherwise similar (I don't know offhand whether it has two drive bays).  They also offer a 3200x1800 display for the M4800, but nothing higher than 1920x1080 for the 17"!!!  Good luck!
While I did not do much research on this because you did not have any real requirements other than replaceable batter and bluetooth.  I have found this mouse on Amazon Mouse.  Based on the reviews the batteries are replaceable and the mouse is rechargeable.  I am not sure if it requires AA or AAA but should work for your purposes.
Processor and memory are certainly very important for you, no two ways about it.  My own experience with a grand sample size of 3 very diverse CPUs (Core 2 Duo E8400, Core i7-920XM, Core i7-5820K) is that the PassMark numbers give a good relative guide to performance on the kinds of software development and photography work that's important to me.  At least based on the PassMark numbers, there hasn't been a great deal of improvement per-core since the 4th generation, including both laptop and desktop.  The top mobile CPUs (45W) all top out around 10,000 since then; some of the Xeon 6th and 7th generation CPUs are a bit faster (up to about 11,000).  You may be able to get more bang for your euro with a high end used laptop, such as a Dell Precision M4800 with a top-end CPU (I should note that all of my laptops, since 2001, have been used high-end Dells).  This is built to a much higher standard of quality than their (or anyone's) consumer-grade system.  I've had mine (which I bought used) since 2011; other than the CPU being poky by contemporary standards, I have no complaints.  I've upgraded quite a few things and replaced the keyboard multiple times (I'm rather rough on that).  If you go that route, do pay very close attention to the components used.  There are many available configurations, with a wide range of processors; don't get one, for instance, with an i5 or lower-end i7.  Otherwise, you haven't given a lot to go on as far as storage, screen, and such; the machine I mentioned does offer multiple screen options, and it's an easy matter to upgrade storage and memory.
The e3-1276v3 processor is significantly faster.  Here is link to openbenchmark of the i3-4150v3 and e3-1276v3 processors running pts/multicore benchmark http://openbenchmarking.org/result/1707040-KH-1707042KH29
Logitech MX Everywhere 2 seems a good option (when in sale). You can have 3 pc's paired (not at the same time) via bluethooth or use a dongle. It tracks at lot of different surfaces with a decent battery life.
The Atom series of CPUs isn't available in socketed form.  Instead, the CPUs are designed to be soldered onto a mainboard, with the combined CPU/board sold to end users or built into a finished product.  The best way to get a C2550 is to decide if you'd rather have a CPU/mainboard combo or a pre-built computer, and pick something that best meets your needs.
My office recently grabbed an HP ScanJet 3000 S3. It's a bit above your price range (closer to $800-900), but I've been in charge of developing our scan process and I can tell you with confidence that it does everything you listed.  We specifically got it to digitize old paper records, and it is set up at a small stand-alone desk with a computer.   ADF = Included A4 sheet size = Included, also has other custom paper sizes. Smaller sheets can sometimes have trouble being grabbed by the feed mechanism, but it's functional. Modes listed above = All included. Desktop size = Fits on a pretty tiny desk with plenty of room to work. Very space efficient.  WLAN / LAN = This feature exists but you have to buy a $40 wireless adapter that is made special just for this unit, and you can only scan to mobile devices using this method. I know don't even get me started right now, but this thing works and finding a wireless workaround solution was extremely simple since we work from a server platform. We returned the stupid $40 USB dongle. Save to SMB Network Share = Included. Price of 600â‚¬ / $ top = Nope.   It's far from a perfect solution and you usually won't find me recommending products that don't fit the user's question, but we had a particularly long and arduous experience trying to find something that would fit our needs. I see similar conditions in your post. We had to make a few compromises, but at the end of the day we needed something and this little headache of a scanner made our project possible. Perhaps it can do the same for you.  I can definitely tell you that unless you're looking for something used, duplex auto-document feed scanners that can handle even a 50 page count stack at a time don't exist for under $600. Well, they may exist, but there wasn't anything I found that was suitable and trustworthy enough for business use.
Without a doubt, investing in a Solid-State hard drive is the best option to extend the life and performance of your laptop. With $100 to play with, you'll be able to afford an SSD with around 240GB of storage which should be plenty of space to install your software/OS and store your files that you work on most often.  I would recommend you have a professional do the installation and Operating system/data migration for you if your technical proficiency does not
The other answer was very helpful, and it opened up a whole set of options I didn't know about. Unfortunately most options are keyboards that are either custom made or have to be ordered internationally. This would mean a lot less favorable return conditions (if at all) should I not be satisfied. So I looked for something I could get in my own country first, where you can almost always return stuff within 2 weeks for a full refund.  So that's for context, and the reason I ended up skipping on the Anne Pro, CODE and WASD, the Varmilo VB87M (which is kinda similar to what I end up recommending), and several others.  Recommendation  I've now bought and am very happy with my CM Storm QuickFire TK (Red), and I would recommend it to others with requirements similar to those in the question. Here's how it stacks up against the requirements:  Must haves:   âœ” QWERTY layout âœ” Full-size shift keys on both sides âœ” Straight layout âœ” Tactile marks on F and J keys Â± Compact but not tiny (it's 378 x 138 mm) âœ” No trackpad âœ” Mechanical switches. Cherry Red. âœ” Clearly separated F-keys   Should haves:   âœ— Wireless âœ” Under $100  âœ” Basic media keys  âœ” Insert/Home/Delete/End/PageUp/PageDown keys âœ” Cursor keys    It actually has a mixed 10-key-pad and cursor keys with Home/etc keys, and the NUMLK key determines which of the two it uses.  Nice to haves:   âœ” Not too loud âœ— Wrist-rest âœ” N-Key rollover   Basically it's the more compact Corsair K70 I said I was looking for, as you can see in this photo:    Afterthought after a few months  Now, a few months after having bought the CM keyboard, I will mention that' I'd still recommend it for my mentioned situation. However, to mention some downsides that I did notice after a few months of usage:   It's really kinda heavy for carrying it along with a laptop (size is okay though) The volume up/down requiring the fn key doesn't feel right, the scroll-wheel on my K70 is far superior The fn key locks after pressing it for a few secs, which happens often when e.g. changing volume, and there is apparently no fix for that   Again though, I'd still recommend it.
Since I can't comment due to a lacking reputation of 50, I will write an answer instead.  First the STK1AW32SC is capable of computing 4k, but it will need to utilize just about everything it has to do so, any other tasks it has to perfom in that time will result in visible quality loss. On the side, newer generations of Intel's CompuStick are more powerfull and are fully 4K capable (see their site for that) but they're not cheap and probably out of question.  I think you should look into the upcoming UpÂ² ("Up Squared") SoC's, they are capable of 4K and most models are also in your price range. I would recommend a 4GB-RAM build over a 2GB.(UP-Board)
Noctua makes a range of low-profile and low-decibel coolers. A number of other companies do as well but in my experience Noctua has the best track record for performance.  This model might work for you:  Noctua Low-Profile Quiet CPU Cooler for Intel 115x Based Retail Cooling NH-L9I  Amazon Link:  https://www.amazon.com/Noctua-Low-Profile-Cooler-Retail-Cooling/dp/B009VCAJ7W  It's 37mm tall, it fits the socket for a kaby lake i3, and it's designed to dissipate ~65W of power draw (your CPU has a TDP of just under 60, since the higher specced i3-7530K runs a TDP of 61... benchmarks for the i3-7530K were easier to find). I can back up the reviews that say it is a virtually silent cooler, as I've used Noctua fans for years. They are excellent quality and barely audible, especially if you mount them using the included rubber stoppers (this will likely be the default installation method for the cooler, that bit more applies to case fans).  Should fulfill all of your requirements, and it's not even more expensive than options from Cooler Master and other manufacturers. Hope this helps.
If all you do is YouTube/Netflix streaming, you could use an Xbox One S  (Note: since you said possibly building, I'm going to assume that this is small enough for you)  Pros   More powerful CPU (than compute stick) 500GB Storage (or 1TB depending on model) vs. 32GB Quick and easy setup Supports 4K You can play games  Blu-ray reader   Cons   It's big It doesn't run Windows (Possibly a reason to not consider this, depending on what you plan on using your 'micro-pc' for.)
Ethereum, like others have said is memory intensive. Therefore AMD cards such as the 470/480 570/580 shine. What you need to look for is the hash rate for each graphic card to determine what is the most cost effective. But, you also have to consider if stock is even available for those cards.  For Ethereum, I would only consider 1060 6GB, 470/570 480/580. Ethereum requires cards that are over 2gb at the moment and it will soon grow to be over 3GB as its DAG size grows overtime. Therefore cards like the RX 550, despite being a watt/cost winner, will not work. Although 1060 3GB will still work, it's not a sound investment as dag is approaching 3GB.  If I were to rank the cards, it would be.   470/570 480/580  1060 6gb   The 470/570 wins as Ethereum does not depend much on the number of cores or GB/s texture fill, but rather memory speeds. They can reach 28~32 Mh/s, equivalent to the 480/580.  The 480/580 is more expensive, but still beats nvidia in terms of performance for a lower MSRP cost. Stock cards run at 22~24 Mhash/s but with timing tweaks, memory overclock it can achieve 28~32 Mh/s. The card draws 100W when underclock to the core and power limit is lowered from personal experience.  The 1060 6GB can mine at ~18 Mh/s, but with memory overclock it can achieve 22~23 Mh/s at 90W.
I have an older model of this drive adapter: Newertech USB 3.0 Universal Drive Adapter  which of course means mine is USB 2.0. The specifications on the web site indicate that the device will work with a USB 2.0 port.  The power supply to the hard drives is a separate set of components. As you note in your question, you already have power to your drive. You would need to connect only the data portion to the drive and the computer to accomplish your objective.  Amazon has it for under US$35.00.
This link agrees with you:     These high prices really hit home when you consider which devices are able connect to this router via 802.11ad, which, at the time of writing, were absolutely none. Just about the only product that has even been announced so far is a middle-of-the-road Acer laptop that you can't yet buy anywhere, while there are no PC card adapters, phones, or tablets yet featuring the technology. We strongly suspect it'll be at least another six months before the situation changes.   That was six months ago, but the article even suggests itâ€™s possible nothing will be available yet. Iâ€™d just keep crossing your fingers and waiting.  The only products I found were this and this, but I donâ€™t think they match what you are looking for.
If you only plan to only cool your CPU with the AIO cooler, I would say 2 140mm fans will keep your CPU plenty cool and be quieter then 3 120mm fans. However if you plan to cool your GPU as well, you will want the 3 120mm radiator. Regardless of the 2 140mm or 3 120mm radiator, the kind of fans used on it will make all the difference.  You can very easily get 3 120mm fans that are considerably quieter then 2 140mm fans, however having less fans will make it easier for keeping things quiet.  From personal experience I have found that very rarely will any cooler come with high quality fans. I usually buy fans regardless if the cooler comes with them or not, that way I can make sure the cooler will be as quiet as possible while still being able to provide good performance.  For radiator fans, and case fans in general, there are 3 things to keep in mind when choosing a fan - fan speed, noise level and static pressure.  Check out this video for an explanation about static pressure vs air flow and why static pressure is important - Static Pressure vs. High Airflow Fans As Fast As Possible  I have personally had extremely good results from Noctua fans, they have a low sound level, good performance and a long life. For a 140mm radiator fan I would recommend this fan - Noctua NF-A14 PWM, if you went with the 3 120mm radiator I would still recommend the Noctua brand - Noctua NF-F12 PWM  Also, it is important to keep in mind that ultimately what is important is not the amount of noise that the fan makes but the amount of noise you hear. Things like where the fan radiator is placed, or what it is placed in, can go a long way in reducing the amount of noise you here.  One such method would be to place the radiator in a box lined with noise suppressing foam as a way to decrease the noise that you hear.  It is also important that your computer fans are setup so the air flows as efficiently as possible, such as fans in the front are intake fans and the fans in the back and top are exhaust fans.  Another thing to keep in mind if your bios offers this feature is to set the fans to variable speed, this allows the fans to only increase their speed (noise) when the computer needs them to.

The device SEJPM mentions in his comment would fit you requirements and is offered by a variety of manufacturers to complement their laptop products as well as 3rd party computing devices. DisplayLink is the company that makes the chips that enable the video functionality. I have used such a device before and I still have it, though I have a problem with calling these devices docks as these are not traditional docks but big dongles with 45W PSUs and they can get quite hot.  They get the job done quite reliably and the manufacturer offers drivers for a wide variety of platforms, even Linux (they didn't offer drivers for their 3.0 devices at first, but this has been solved a few years back). My older Thinkpad T530 from 2012 had no problems displaying 3 1080p videos with this and my 2 Dell 1080p monitors connected at home.  Edit: In theory everything should work fine, but I did some testing with the devices I have here in the office (1Ã—Dell U2512H, several Dell U2412M), turns out that you should check when getting one of the DisplayLink devices and which one in particular exactly as dual 2560Ã—1440 may be too much for Gen 3xxx devices like mine, devices with 5xxx chips may support such high resolutions older ones were probably made to just support dual 1080p or 1200p.  The U2512H is detected on my Linux machines with recent drivers at proper resolution but as soon as I plug one of the other monitors in its resolution drops to the highest one supported at this data rate (similar to HDMI 1.3 only capable devices, though I connected the bigger monitor to the DisplayPort output). You can set the refresh rate to 30Hz to still drive the monitor at full resolution, but I don't recommend that. DisplayPort chaining is not supported on mine, so a third monitor will just be a clone.  Also DisplayLink solutions don't support night modes as offered through f.lux, Redshift and some recent desktop environments.
PepWave MAX HD4 would be the item you are looking for.
Have you considered a low-end NUC for that use case?  Probably too late here, but I have the exact same use case and wanted to share my solution and see if you managed to find an alternative. After looking around and finding no single board alternatives, I've come across some lower end NUCs that may work for the task, like the Gigabyte GB-BACE-3000 Brix.  It's not exactly the same kind of device, but it ticks all your boxes while still having a very low power consumption.   Gigabit Port: 1 USB 3.0: 4 (optional) SATA: 1 (optional) x86 based processor for Windows: yes under or slightly above 100â‚¬ (or $): yes
http://assets.coolermaster.com/landing/am4-socket-ready/v2/download/RR-AM4B-H212-S1.pdf  That is a link to the installation instructions for installing a Coolermaster after-market cooler. It lists the following models as compatible with an AM4 socket:   MasterAir Pro 4 MasterAir Pro 3 Hyper 412 Series Hyper 212 EVO Hyper 212 X   The instructions specifically state that you need to remove those two plastic brackets and the screws, using the backplate and the holes in the motherboard to install the cooler instead of those brackets.  I'm certain that if you looked at other cooler manufacturers like BeQuiet or Noctua you could find something with similar after-market brackets if none of the listed options meet your other unlisted requirements, whatever they may be.  I will also recommend contacting Asus and having them ship you a spare bracket, as I'm not able to find any online that aren't the usual litany of poorly priced ebay listings. Your motherboard should have come with that, and if your aftermarket cooler were to break or something that backup option should be available to you. You're the customer, get what you paid for.
This is a tough one for a number of reasons. E-ink displays are traditionally way too slow for practical use in the capacity that you're talking about, the refresh rate is way too long and you end up with artifacts on the screen. I've tried this myself with an e-reader, it was not a good experience. This thread details some similar experiences, if that helps lend any credibility:  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8327281  So we've identified a problem, let's focus on a solution. I warn you now it is not cheap, but it's really the only thing that is going to do what you're asking it to do and it's all I've been able to find the past two days of hunting.  http://www.einkmonitor.com/  That monitor is pretty much the only thing you're going to find that will provide a usable experience with a full operating system (Windows, iOS, etc.). Obviously it will also do the trick for reading. It is specifically designed from the ground up to be a functional e-ink monitor, and utilizes new technology and algorithms to improve response time and give the user control over features and settings. It is portable, though large.  The newer revision is $1k, the old one isn't much cheaper. The newer one does have one major portability advantage in that a single HDMI cord can provide picture and power to the monitor.  Here's where things get tricky. You'll need a computer, some sort of input device(s), and a method of generating power. There are a lot of ways to get creative with this, but again few of them are cheap.  You could go the laptop route, but it'd be unwieldy. I guess something like a raspberry pi or an intel compute stick might work in conjunction, but you'd likely be forced into having access to a power outlet so also not ideal. As far as input devices, there are a wide range of wireless input mechanisms available to you. These would be best selected after you figure out the computer portion of this portable system, so you know what kind of I/O options you're looking at. All of that stuff is better left for a different (and more specific) question here on HardwareRecs.  To wrap all this up with a direct answer:     Is there a tablet/notebook, that runs a normal operating system (like windows or iOS, or Ubuntu), where you can open word processors, chrome, and so forth, which has an e-ink display (and is cheap)?   No, there is not. Your best bet would be to build something yourself if you think yourself capable. You'll likely end up dropping well over $1,000 USD in the endeavor, because anything less than the e-ink monitor listed above will not function in a useful capacity due to limitations of the technology. It's not impossible, but it's a tall order. Best of luck.
You will hate to read that but I would strongly recommend you to buy a MacBook Air. 13" for, you guessed it, $999.00.  Here the specs  1.8GHz Processor  128GB Storage 1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor Turbo Boost up to 2.9GHz 8GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 memory 128GB SSD storage1 Intel HD Graphics 6000   I bought a Mac to get my projects into the Apple ecosystem and I just KNEW I would never touch it again but within hours it became my main device for everything. Music production, photoshop, programming, a bit of video editing, creating websites, ... It's so nice not having to deal with Microsoft's flawed OS. You can install Windows on it (which wouldn't make too much sense) but you'll find most of the software for macOS as well.  Idk why metal casing is important to you but if my Mac can survive 3 years of being thrown around in a student's rucksack, you should be doing just fine with it. Battery life is also extraordinary.  Also, they keep their price tags for ages.. you could easily sell it for more than 500 bucks in 4 years if you kept it in good condition.  Like I said, you won't like this reply but please consider it. I regret having been so stubborn for so long, getting a Mac earlier in my life would've made it a lot easier.
Monitor hood  A monitor hood might be a better way to go than a matte screen. A hood is a simple less expensive solution. Graphics professionals always use a monitor hood, to go easier on their eyes and to perceive more accurate colors.   And getting a hood frees you up to choose any kind of monitor you wish, based on other criteria.
A quick shot at Google using "multi-monitor kvm" search found a company with the features you've noted. Good thing your budget is flexible.  Dual monitor systems appear to be much more economical than triple (in progress, per one site) or quad.  KVM Switches Online does a great job of categorizing the products available, specifically in this case, allowing you to pick HDMI for dual or quad monitors. One of the switches supports USB 3.0 while the other list as USB 2.0 only. The USB 3.0 unit is listed as a hub, but the image of the front shows 3 ports. The rear of the unit has 2 USB ports marked for keyboard and mouse.      I should read your question before I hit the submit button. The device listed supports 4k video resolution as well as audio switching. The information leads me to believe that the switched-off unit gets muted, which is as it should be.   A reference is made in the PDF for the product of hot-key switching but no specifics are available.   As is typical of these products, cables are purchased separately. It appears that these units do not require proprietary cables.  The Q/A section of the site suggests to a user that if the above item is inappropriate, to purchase a different (USB 2.0 version) instead. It appears to be nearly the same cost, but with more USB ports on the panel.
You could possibly get one of those 3M privacy screen covers? Produces a matte display and adds some extra security.

I just moved from a MacBook to a Lenovo ThinkPad Carbon X1 (4th gen), and I purchased a refurb directly from Lenovo. 8GB RAM, i7, and smallish SSD. I swapped out the SSD for a 1TB nvme after purchasing the Carbon X1. Total price was around $1200. Very very happy with this machine.
If the socket is the same, yes. But personally I wouldn't, multithreading really speeds things up.
If you can swing $110, I'd get the RX 460. It does have 2GB instead of 4GB, but higher memory bandwidth and clock speed. However, it is several tiers up the chart in terms of overall performance from what you've listed. Further, be careful ordering from China/HongKong. I've been burned before.  From GPUboss    If you had pick between the two you've listed, I'd go with the 7770.
Based on your response to my comment, I would highly recommend Synergy.  I use this product so much. I go back and forth between two monitors side by side with Ubuntu box on one, and Windows on the other. I also slide over and control my macbookpro that sits next to the three.  All with a single keyboard and mouse.  Much cheaper than a KVM and better functionality in my opinion...like copy/pasting across machines...
Nothing with more than 2 ports exists as far as I know. (2017-07) Even the chips to make it are limited to 2 ports as far as I can tell. Wanted this for a while myself for a group of pixels and other devices that are all type C. They are getting closer: Lifepowr has an indiegogo with 100W type c dual ports. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lifepowr-a3-world-s-1st-usb-c-power-delivery-pack-battery-powerbank#/
Im a big fan of HP these days.. Used to be a big Dell person but they tend to offer less bang for your buck these days.   If your looking to save a few bucks my thoughts would be to scale down the Hard Drive to a 256GB.. That should provide enough space for your core environment. You can always buy cheap external hard drive (or 2nd Internal if possible) later on if it turns out you need to. My set up is to only have core software on the main HD and save projects externally.   Anyways, if that concept is ok with you, then here is one that I've had my eye on.. https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAADF5MK0383  Truthfully,  You could probably drop the RAM down to 8 GB and still have a pleasurable experience programming.  https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=1TS-000D-01GH8 This one is configurable, I would take the I7 2.7GHz, non touch, Windows Pro, 256 GB SSD, 8GB RAM.. Thats a pretty good value for $869 and i think HP is doing a pretty good job these days.  One last thought, AMD is making great processors as of late. While their newest line of products hasn't quite hit the market yet (they will be awesome) they still make great products for less then Intel. Apple even released recently that they will be putting AMD in their highest end computers. So, with that said... Check this one out...

Your objective may be easily accomplished, depending on the scope of "larger than 5V" and "larger than 2A."   The few units I've examined via a search using the terms "USB volt amps meter" have presented ranges up to 9V and current up to 3A. The lower priced devices appear to lower limits, which is understandable.  I was surprised to discover a meter which lists in the specifications a maximum of 10V and 10A. One would suspect that it would not be used to measure voltage and current from a computer USB port. This particular unit also supported single input, dual outputs.  I cannot attest to the "modern USB power delivery standards" as the ad copy I've found does not include that reference. The units I've located fit in your specified budget with room to spare. Three US dollars up to about twenty, international availability for most sources.
The thing you you are looking for is called a Linear Actuator http://amzn.to/2uWRIjV  Depending on the strength of linear actuator you get, you might not even need a latch.  You can have the Arduino power the linear actuator until it senses the door fully closed or open. When it is not powered it will hold its position.
There are cheap USB audio dongles, you could try to hook up as many as you need and configure the audio output of your operating system accordingly. Linux with PulseAudio (recommended), JACK or probably plain ALSA (I doubt that though) should be able to do such kind of broadcast, but the USB bus will be a limitation at some point. Some other problems of USB audio may also occur.  You could look for audio recording interfaces that usually come with more headphone outputs, usually they also have monitoring outputs for low latency. My Behringer FCA610 as 2 of these outputs. You could feed 2 headphones through the monitoring ports and another 3 stereo devices through the connectors on the back without any complicated wiring, but 2 headphones on every output should be possible, not recommended though. There is an FCA1616 and many other affordable recording interfaces with more ports that would fit this need.  Of course there are also HiFi DAC/Amps that deliver more power to demanding headphones. I also have 2 of these (mobile and desktop). Mixing a great variety of different loads to feed them with high(er) power without any calculation, just hoping every load will work ideally has a high risk of getting mixed results or damaging some component.  Since you didn't mention any specific usecase, you could also utilize Bluetooth to connect at least one more device.
10 "normal" headphones in parallel would look like a short circuit to an amp or laptop output, so no, I do not expect that to work.   The better solution would be every headphone gets an amp. And the laptop can feed the input for those amps in parallel. This can work because the amps have a much higher impedance than those "normal" headphones, it wont look like a short circuit to the laptop.  The only way to do one amp powering 10 headphones in parallel is if all your headphones have the same impedance, and all of them are 40+ ohms of impedance. And you will need a speaker amp for this, not just a normal headphone amp.  It might be cheaper to just use a few of these Headphone amplifiers designed to feed multiple headphones like this http://amzn.to/2uB2vPW  and connect 3 of those amps in parallel to your laptop.
First, I'll post the solution which may not directly fit your needs, but could at least be worth a consideration and will probably deliver significantly higher performance, however you'll essentially be getting a highly portable desktop PC, so you need:   A monitor wherever you go A mouse A keyboard   If you are actually in a situation where you can have these (easily?) available where you go (and note that there are modern variants of all of these designed for high mobility), I can recommend (even though I did not actually test / own one):  The Titan X179 Workstation  Why does it fit your needs? Because it runs workstation / server-grade equipment in a very compact case!  Up to:   Just about any Intel Xeon E5 v4 (Codename: Broadwell-EP), up to 22 physical cores, will just about blow everything else mobile out of the window (you may want to know that the Xeon is fastering than everything else because of parallelism, the actual cores have quite a low base-clock and architecturally are also 2 generations behind as of now, which amounts to a few per cent performance difference) 16, 32, 64 or 128 GB Error-Checking and Correcting Memory (a Xeon-only feature that you may not need) Up to 6TB of Samsung Pro-branded SSD storage (2x SATA, 1x M.2), also note that the M.2 SSD has a 1.2PBW / 5yr warranty policy (that is they guarantee that it will work for 5 years or 1.2 Peta-bytes written, whichever happens first) and the SATA SSD has a at least a 300TBW / 10yr warranty policy.
Now for the more traditional approach: You want a CPU-heavy actual laptop with a decent amount of fast storage and quite a bit of RAM. So the obvious solution is to look for the beefiest CPU that can be crammed into a laptop and go from there. Normally people would just look for laptop CPUs here, but because Gamers being Gamers, there are laptops that use Desktop CPUs which of course are much better performance-wise due to higher peak clocks (but of course cooling and power consumption tend to make such laptops hot, loud and with short battery lifetime).  So my recommendation will be:  The Origin PC EON17-X  Which features (up to)   An Intel Core i7-7700K (Codename: Kaby Lake), with 4 physical cores and remarkably high clock rates (meaning these cores will be very fast and much faster individually than the Xeon cores from my other answer) and notably, this is a desktop CPU, so you should a) be able to actually overclock it if you so want and b) it is allowed to produce much more heat and thus stay at higher clocks for longer. 64 GB of (non-ECC) RAM  If I'm parsing the configuration page right, up to four 2TB Samsung Pro SSDs (2x M.2 and 2x SATA), comments from my other answer apply.
Those 7XXX series GPUs are very very old. Don't get them. They are not as efficient, as powerful and has less compelling feature-set. For $100 max, you can sometimes get the Radeon RX 460 2/4GB (got mine new for $80 from Amazon) or a GTX 1050 Ti. Current prices are a little high - not sure why, but some radeons cost even more than their MSRPs. That wasn't the case few months ago. So, I would suggest waiting if you find nothing good.  Just checked - newegg sells the rx 460 (2GB) for $90 on their ebay site http://www.ebay.com/itm/SAPPHIRE-Radeon-RX-460-DirectX-12-100409-2GOC-2L-2GB-128-Bit-GDDR5-PCI-Express-3-/302207375605?hash=item465cf698f5:g:brEAAOSw-0xYe4fX   These prices come from time to time. Just be patient
A Surface Pro may be good. I cant say I've ever used one myself but they're full Windows 10 so I guess it'd be easier to integrate? Only issue if they're a tad expensive...
According to UserBenchmark, the relative scores of each GPU are as follows (assuming 100% is the performance of the GTX 1070):  HD 7670 - 7%  HD 7770 - 18%  GTX 650 - 11%  R7 360 - 25%  GTX 1050 - 34%  GTX 1050Ti - 38%  The R7 350 does not appear on UserBenchmark so I used the performance of the RX 360 instead.  I hope this helps you make a more informed decision.
According to this page on Intel's ARK, the integrated graphics card inside your processor already supports 4K video at 24fps over HDMI or 4K video at 60fps over DisplayPort.  tl;dr - You don't need to buy a graphics card.
I bought the Plantronics GameCom 788 as my first headset and every other headset I've tried after just felt and sounded terrible. It's the best audio-related purchase I ever made besides my studio monitors.  I can never go back to any other headset.  The sound quality is great, and the microphone quality is honestly astounding. I have a broadcast quality microphone and there is almost zero noticeable difference between them.  Also, the Dolby drivers that come with it just make everything sound so much better. I can't deal with it being off any more.  And just so you know, the GameCom 780 and 788 are the exact same. The only difference is design. I have owned both.  Technical Details:   Connects via USB cable (works with consoles too) Open cups give a larger sound stage Not sure what the ear and headband padding is made of but it's breathable and comfortable. Very reasonable cost of between Â£30-50 GBP considering the quality Licensed Dolby 7.1 surround sound tech that I don't understand but everything sounds way better with the option turned on   Official Product Page
I cannot say for sure whether your adapter is an active one or not, but my strong assertion is that it is not. My reasoning here is that feature is usually a selling point and they typically are priced higher as well. You can try it but I doubt it will work properly.  Now I did verify that you need an active adapter to do what you're trying to do with Eyefinity, and I was able to find this: "Cable Matters Gold Plated Active DisplayPort to DVI Male to Female Adapter - Eyefinity Compatible". That particular one is on sale on Amazon at the moment, but you can definitely look around for other products if you need other features (cord length, whatever else) or want to hunt for a better deal. Just make sure the words active adapter" are clearly spelled out on the product page.  As for this part:     The reason this matters is because i've read that EyeFinity will only support it if it is using an active adapter, and then something about having only two streams??   I think what you're talking about doing here is called Multi-Stream Transport, a technology featured in DisplayPort 2.1. It allows you to run multiple monitors from a single DisplayPort output, but does have limitations depending on your overall configuration. From what I can tell you don't need to make use of that feature to accomplish your objectives here.  One more thing just to clarify EyeFinity; that software is only designed to play games and other fullscreen applications across multiple displays, so you can game in ultra widescreen formats and whatnot. You don't need EyeFinity to use your operating system or to do single monitor gaming, so I wanted to make sure that it's clear here that EyeFinity is not a necessary technology for standard computer use.
Motherboard, ssd, and ram are all negligible wattage. I usually group them and say they use 100 watts max as computer parts are very efficient these days. But for the sake of calculating.    The RX 570 has a 120W TDP.  DDR4 is around 15W for four modules. SSD is around 12W max for two. NVME is around 14W max for two. 1700x has a 95W TDP. Motherboards (lga 775 gaming) use 40 to 75 watts This number is probably drastically lowered as modern motherboards are more efficient and consume less power.   Therefore you only need 451 W under max load. So you really only need a 550W powersupply. You could also get away with a 500W quality PSU as it's most likely your system won't be at 100% full GPU, CPU, SSD at any given point.  I should note that, you should probably look at getting the rx580 or rx480 instead of trying to crossfire weaker cards. Vega is also around the corner if you can wait. Crossfire has a slew of problems, and spotty game support. It's better to get a single powerful card.
A question and two good options:   Question: Are you sure you need it? When did you see 4K doesn't run well? Can you link to the file/video you've tried?   The I5-6500 with its iGPU should run 4K smoothly, at least at 30FPS, according to my tests (with an I5-6300HQ)  Also, I have an "old" laptop with an I5-4300U which much slower than your CPU and doesn't have the playback features the Skylake CPU has, and it can do 4K almost smoothly.   Replace the CPU. The newer Kaby Lake CPUs with a certain iGPU (integrated GPU) and up will do 4K playback smoothly + efficiently. This will save you the need for another card = less heat + less energy required. With reselling your Skylake I5, the difference in price will be small - at least as small as getting a new Graphics card   I would suggest places like /r/hardwareswap on reddit (no feed and such like eBay)   GPU from the latest series. The cheapest is the Nvidia GT 1030. I see it for $65-$70 on newegg/amazon and pretty sure that with minimal effort and some patience you'll get it for much lower price     Some additional notes:   Very important to keep in mind that playback performance depends not only on the hardware, but on the software and played back file.
The Logitech G300 (or G300S) is an ambidextrous mouse that has served me very well for years now. It's branded as gaming but hasn't got a ridiculous design. I also do pretty much everything you mentioned doing and it's never failed me.  The only potential drawback I can see is that you need the Logitech software to map the extra buttons, but that's a given. Regardless, it can still be used in the plug-n-play style you're after.  It's also fairly cheap at Â£30 brand new.
OK, so let's go through what you need (in components) and what you need from each component. You can then go ahead and either a) trust the recommendation of the people building the system for you for the specififc part or b) browse around here or other places and pick one yourself or c) make another question here for a specific recommendation for a specific part.  You'll need the following in a new desktop computer (I'll ignore peripherals here, that is mouse, keyboard and monitor):   A Central Processing Unit (CPU). The CPU is it what executes all the "logic" that make up applications and controls all the other hardware devices and processes and reacts to your input. Blender being a rendering program, it can split the difficult parts of its work into different chunks and process them independently, so you want many cores from your CPU (8+ preferably for maximum speed). A core is basically one "sub-CPU" that performs fast, sequential logic operations and a bunch of cores with some memory form the CPU. As for the budget, you probably want to spend about 1/3 (maybe a bit more) of your PC-only budget on the CPU and the motherboard. The options you have, include a) server-grade CPUs with many cores which are expensive and require special motherboards or b) current high-end gaming CPUs with quite a few cores (6-10) which are "cheap" and will work but not as good as the other options or c) the (very soon) upcoming AMD "Threadripper" CPUs which will have up to 16 cores for probably a reasonable price or d) the (in october) upcoming Intel Skylake-X CPUs which will have even more cores, but probably also will be expensive (although probably cheaper than a). Given your budget it is probably best to get an AMD Threadripper CPU as they come out (the 16 core one, 1950X) which will probably be just above one thousand dollars. Performance-wise it will probably be at least 10x as fast as your MacBook's CPU. A CPU cooling system. This is the the fan or water-based system that cools your CPU down. The above mentioned CPUs don't come with this (usually) and thus you need a custom one. There are two main ways of doing this: A fan on-top of a metallic block on the CPU to cool it (usually quite cheap) or a water-based heat extractor on the CPU which uses water to transport the heat to a fan on the border of the case. The latter is a bit more expensive but can also move more heat away and should be much easier to clean (given that you only need to clean the outside reachable fans!). Such systems can be acquired for 50-150 USD easily and usually I'd just suggest the biggest Corsair water one that supports your CPU (rather the CPU's mount, there are adapters) and that still fits in your case, details depend on your case and your specific CPU here and should be clarified in its own question. A mainboard (sometimes also motherboard or MB). The mainboard essentially connects all the components and as such it needs to be compatible with the specific CPU you are getting and everything else will usually follow naturally. As the relevant CPU recommendation is not yet out, it's hard to make a proper recommendation here, I suggest just asking another question here after the 10th August for the mainboard. If you go with the Threadripper, you should have no problem finding a really good MB for 500 USD. Random Access Memory (RAM). This is the place where all the data gets stored that is too big to fit in the CPU's internal storage but that will need to be accessed again very soon by running programs. The main three metrics to look out for are: Size, Clock and Latency with the latter two having usually a minor impact on performance (a few % usually). In general, you probably want to have half or more of your MB's supported memory in-use, so in your case this will probably be 32GB which will allow you to use more complex assets in Blender and it will probably also be a bit faster than your MacBook because modern RAM is usually clocked higher by default. I can't give a specific recommendation here (because details also somewhat depend on the specific CPU and the MB) but you can probably get the RAM for less than 500 USD, for details I suggest asking another question as soon as you have the MB picked. A graphics processing unit (GPU). This is usually a card that you insert into your computer, which does a lot of computations in parallel. Blender can greatly use the cheap gamer graphics cards and so my recommendation would be to get two Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 Ti cards (probably 800 USD each). They are the top-of-the-line cards and Blender can apparently make great use of them so that having two will usually cut times in half. Also apparently the Titan Xp will not be much faster (comparison video) (but is twice as expensive). For the specific model follow the advice in the introduction ;) A power supply unit (PSU). This is the piece of hardware in your computer that will take your the power out of your wall-socket and transform it such that the computer can use it. The main characterstics of these are the efficiency and the total power they provide. The efficiencies usually get certified and as such you probably want one with gold or above certification and which can supply at least 800W (because each of the cards draw 250W max and the CPU probably 150W by itself), you can probably get this for 200-300 USD. For specific recommendations, again make a new question please :) Storage. Storage is the place where your data is when your computer is off or when the data is not actually needed right now. In your case it is relevant because it influences loading times of assets. There are three types of relevant drives right now:   Hard Disk Drives (HDDs): These are spinny drives that can store a lot of data for little money but can't provide this data quickly or fast. SATA Solid State Drives (SATA-SSDs): These are drives without moving parts (similar to USB sticks) which are fast but more expensive. PCIe SSDs: These are SSDs that are connected closely to the CPU which are extremely fast but also somewhat expensive.   My recommendation would be to get one of each. Use the PCIe SSD to store your current project files, use the HDD to archive data and use the SATA-SSD to store programs, documents and games. For the HDD, probably a WD Blue 4TB (100-200 USD) will do best, paired with a Samsung 850 Evo (500GB / 1TB whatever you feel you need, 200-300 USD) and with a Samsung 960 Pro (500 GB, 300 USD, Pro because you will probably write a lot of data to it). A case. The case is the thing you actually see from the outside and which holds all the components that you have. Special features that make cases interesting is the number and size of fans, whether it has dust filtering and whether it has noise-reduction and the size. You probably want a bigger case that can hold both the cards and the MB, dust filtering will also be nice, you should be able to get this for less than 300 USD. Again, specific recommendations in a specific post.   So in total we end up with 1000 + 150 + 500 + 500 + 2*800 + 300 + 300 + 800 = 5150, leaving a bit of wiggle room if I underestimated prices here and leaving enough money for a decent monitor and a decent keyboard. Performance-wise, this will overall easily be 10x as fast as your MacBook and will do most tasks with unnoticable delay.
I decided to try my luck with a router: Asus RT-AC51U AC750  And use a pair of access point in the house.  So far, all stable, stable speeds, 0 drops, the router accepts multiple configurations and extensive compatibility .  and Based on Linux.
Your motherboard can run any of the listed RAM speeds, but the extra speed will not be utilised if you do not use Extreme Memory Profile (XMP), leaving your more expensive purchase of faster RAM a useless investment.   Due to this, If you are not thinking of modifying your BIOS settings, I would recommend choosing which ever speed of RAM is the least expensive in the range/brand you are looking at.   For example, Corsair Dominator Platinum 2400Mhz is actually more expensive p/gb than 3000Mhz, even though some of the customers of the 3000Mhz product won't use the XMP option, the price is better because uninformed PC enthusiasts buy more of the faster RAM, as it seems more beneficial.  The answer to your question is that the RAM is clocked at the speed listed, but to take advantage of that speed, you will need to enable the XMP option in your BIOS menu.   OC means that the memory controller on the motherboard is overclocked when using 2933 or faster RAM, such as the 3200Mhz products.
I made a similar thread a couple weeks ago and settled for this Mini PC:   It's been great so far. I'm pushing 4k on it comfortably and it seems powerful enough for streaming and general web browsing. It's not great at multitasking as you can imagine for a small PC but it's been great for me so far!
In order to use an external Graphics Processing Unit (eGPU) you (usually) need three components:   A Thunderbold 3 cable (I will not elaborate on this one) A case / box that supplies power and a mount for desktop graphics cards A desktop graphics card that satisfies the spatial and power constraints of the box   In the blog entry the box is an Akitio Thunder3 and the graphics card is a Nvidia Geforce GTX 1050 Ti. The Thunder3 provides the mount for the desktop graphics card, provides the power and the PCIe <=> Thunderbolt 3 interface and optionally also provides power for the connected laptop.     Is it not possible to just buy eGPU and connect it to my laptop Mac?   There is no such thing as an "eGPU", the name designates the concept of using an external GPU, which is most commonly done by "faking" an internal environment to an internal GPU externally.  If you are interested in actually acquiring an eGPU solution, egpu.io has nice coverage, reviews, guides and overviews.
Tried the quite model of the Beebox, but really, did not work. Its Celeron CPU is not enough to keep several browsers opened concurrently, so you get stuck at some point.  Other barebones and the models proposed here can reduced noise, but are not free of it, which is what I'm pursuing.  Finally, I got an HP Elitebook Folio G1, which is not cheap, but works in total silence: no fan and good performance. Installed a very light distro (Lubuntu) right away and it worked fine, despite some adjustment in the BIOS configuration (the keyboard was not working after resume), plus problems to definitely get ride of Windows 10. Also worth mentioning that you need to buy extra gadgets for connectivity (HDMI/DP, Ethernet, USB connectors...)  So, any ultrabook should fit with the requirements, only read in detail how well it performs in the way you want it to run.
DisplayPort is the newest and with the highest bandwidth, even compared to the first HDMI 2.0 connections. You won't have problems with 4K@60FPS  Take into account the limitations of the display. If you have an HDMI 1.4 support in your display, then that's will be the limitation, so I guess that in your case, you won't be able to do 4K@60FPS, only 4K@30FPS (which should be good for movies)  DisplayPort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#1.2 (you probably have 1.2, maybe 1.3, but probably not)  HDMI 2.0: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#Version_2.0  Check the bandwidth difference
DVI does not support 4k60 so your only option is to use the display-port.  As your TV is most likely HDMI only, getting a display-port to hdmi 2.0 adapter is fine as that provides plenty of bandwidth for 4k60.  I recommend using Display-port to hdmi 2.0 for your TV, and using DVI to your monitor so you don't have to switch between the two physically. If not you can just continue to share the hdmi connection from the display-port adapter.
Most all electronic devices have a MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) specification.  You can use the spec. to find the highest MTBF, and then calculate how many you will need to cover 100 years.  Of course this is on average. Your best bet would be to exceed it as much as possible.  And whatever you do, DON'T drop it!
Check out openUPS2 or NUC-UPS from mini-box.com, they even have hard drive mounting footprint for easy integration with case. They also send ON/OFF pulse to the motherboard via 2 wire or USB for graceful shutdown.
I don't think there are any devices that can use USB3.1gen2 potential, so if USB3.1gen1 is OK for you, you should take a look at Dell D6000 docking station: http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-universal-dock-d6000/apd/452-bcyt/pc-accessories  It has:   1x USB 3.1gen1 type-C port 4x USB 3.1gen1 type-A port 2x DP port (5k capable) 1x HDMI port RJ45 (Ethernet) port 3.5mm combo jack for headphones/microphone power delivery   And probably it is still cheaper than Thunderbolt dock
Option 1. If you are locked with this machine with no option for replacing and you are interested in having only it, then you best bet for local GPU solution is using an mSata or NGFF eGPU like this https://www.banggood.com/NGFF-Version-V8_0-EXP-GDC-Beast-Laptop-External-Independent-Video-Card-Dock-p-1009978.html?rmmds=search It is quite slow, but it will boost performance for GPU based application considerably - especially if you'll connect to it an external monitor (thus relieving the PCIe connection from having to transmit the video signal too)  Option 2: Otherwise, consider simply getting another pc (no need for a laptop) to do the heavy lifting. You can buy something rather cheap with a good GPU. You can even connect to it remotely from your laptop, sending it tasks  Option 3. you might want to consider running GPU tasks on a remote machine altogether. There are such services
I'm having trouble finding anything that actually has all of the ports and connectors that (I think) you'll need, but I can explain how I would go about this. If you can get me specifics on what display outputs are available on your PC and laptop, as well as your monitor resolution and refresh rate, I'll take some time to find you the exact equipment.    What you want is a KVM switch, a mechanism designed to use one keyboard, mouse, and monitor (in your case two monitors) as a workstation that can dynamically swap between two computers. I recommend this over a standard dock for ease of use, flexible configurations, and preservation of desk surface real estate.  You've basically got two approaches. One is expensive and the other is somewhat convoluted.  https://www.startech.com/Server-Management/KVM-Switches/  That site is a good place to start, they make high end switches and they're just about the only company I can find that even does digital video formats or dual monitor outputs in any significant capacity. Almost everything else I've been able to pull up has been either analog (VGA) or DVI with maybe a few DVI-Dual Links in there. The downside of this approach is that you're probably going to drop $200+ on this solution.  The other method you could use would be to downgrade your cable connections to DVI (or whatever you can find that is compatible) and get two cheap units that handle single monitor outputs. This is still likely to run you $60+. There's also a concern about what resolution and refresh rate you're running at, as each type of cable has a ceiling on how much data it can transfer and thus what resolutions and frame rates it is capable of transmitting. I haven't found any single monitor HDMI or DisplayPort boxes that were cheap enough to consider over the StarTech products linked above, but you may have more luck. I searched Amazon, Newegg, and PCPartPicker if you were curious. Office Depot or Office Max might be worth a try.  PLEASE KEEP IN MIND: Most of these KVM switches do not come with extra cables, so plan your layout and figure out the types and lengths of cables you will need beforehand and order them alongside your KVM solution. This will save you headaches and irritation and time waiting for shipping.  Again, if you want to reply with those related specs that I mentioned above, I can find some time before Friday to help you hunt down specific hardware.    Keyboards are really up to you. If you don't mind a 60% board I can recommend an Anne Pro, I have one for work and love it; however, I haven't used it for gaming since it has a tiny layout and red switches. I can confirm though that it has built-in bluetooth (comes with dongle for non-BT devices) and hotkey device swapping for up to four connected devices, so it would fit your requirements there. Bonus points for being under $100 and having quality RGB because colors are fun. If that doesn't catch your eye, I know that Filco also has some good offerings, and CODE keyboards are always worth a look as well.  The subreddit for mechanical keyboards has this wiki page listing wireless options:  https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/wireless-mechanical_keyboards  You could also search around on that forum to see what other people have used and what they liked/disliked, it's an active community with a good amount of content.
Here is a recommendation I gave for the Anne Pro. It hits your check boxes and it's a nice board in my experience, although some minor configuration is required and a little dielectric grease on the stabilizers is warranted.  https://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/7633/6475  I'll shorten it up for your specific question:    This doesn't hit all of your checkboxes, but I like it quite a bit so I'll throw in a recommendation for an Anne Pro mechanical keyboard. I picked one up a few weeks ago because the robber dome boards at work were hurting my fingers. It's a pretty great board, but I'll go through your concerns so you have a decent rundown. For background, I've also got a K70 at home (cherry browns) and I went with cherry reds on my Anne. (EDIT: This board actually comes with gateron switches, not original cherry switches.)   Low price (<=100 EUR) since this will my secondary keyboard   Usually runs about $80 USD   Blue (or green) switches (Cherry)   Gateron switches, offered in blue, brown, and red.   en-gb keyboard layout   There are three preset layouts and one that you can customize entirely, including the Fn layer.   Media keys   The board does support macro functions through the app, and I've seen plenty of people talk about using media macros. The function is currently broken in firmware 1.4 (current version), but should be fixed for 1.5 before the year is out.   Stuff you should know:  They've got a subreddit with guides for everything to do with this keyboard if you decide to get it. Firmware update and app installation (needed for the custom preset, I haven't done it yet that's happening this week) are a bit of a pain from the looks of things, but not too bad. There is no physical power switch. The company says you can just disable bluetooth and RGB and that will put the board into a kind of sleep mode, but you'll notice on that sub that a lot of people install physical switches to kill power and avoid accidental key presses while carrying the keyboard in a bag and having it connected to a mobile device like your phone. The mod looks easy and I'll probably end up doing it myself, most people say it takes less than an hour.  It's not a perfect board but I'm liking it an awful lot. Amazon has the red switches version in stock here: https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Pro-Bluetooth-Backlight-Smartphone/dp/B06XW87X9D/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1498494412&sr=8-5&keywords=anne+pro+keyboard  Feel free to ask any questions if I missed anything.  EDIT: Just going to throw in a quick mention for CODE boards, as those are also highly rated and very popular for programming. They were the primary competition to the Anne Pro among keyboards I was looking at, and while I ended up not going with them they're a respectable company and may have something closer to the form factor that you're looking for, if that's an important enough concern for you.    It's a pretty solid little board, I like it a lot.
A used GTX 1060 6GB or a new GTX 1060 3GB would be a lot faster than your GTX 660 http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1778?vs=1771 Or a Radeon 470 (prices are high now, but it was selling for $140-$160 not long ago) http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1778?vs=1872  But you might as well be patient..
Seeing as your budget supports it, I would recommend the Motorola Moto G5 or the G5 Plus. If you are looking even better that that, the the Motorola Moto Z is pretty good.  The reason why I suggest Motorola is because they have NO bloatware and they are fast, very fast. Most of them come standard with multiple gbs of RAM, top end processors etc.  They are also very good value for money. For buying, just Google the make and model, and put "sim free" at the end, unless you intend to buy from the high street.  If these options don't suit you, I would suggest using www.gsmarena.com and specify what you want in their advanced search.
It so happens that there is a software only way to do this.  I was watching LinusTechTips and they were advertising this software on their end of video sponsor.  The software is called Synergy.  It actually works by creating some sort of local network and communicating over your own computers, making the experience very, very fast. The benefits of this over a hardware KVM switch is that this is software (not hardware duh ;)) and it is priced as low as $19, depending on the option you pick.  The $19 option would be perfectly suitable for your needs, other options are encryption over the network, and unless your network is already insecure, you dont really need it.  As per a concern below, it runs on both wireless and wired connections!  Hope this is a suitable suggestion for you.
So small and simple, but you can use this display with any computer that has HDMI output, and the shape makes it easy to attach to a electronic product. Although the 800x480 common HDMI display is made for Raspberry Pi, we can use it other where not only for Raspberry Pi.   Description of the product from your link.  That product will work with any computer, provided it has an HDMI output.
Well, the short answer is:  Yes  This list might help:   http://www.ultrabookreview.com/6520-fanless-ultrabooks/  It is a detailed list of laptops that are of a fanless design and would be more in line with what you are asking about.  However, without more details a proper recommendation is hard to give.  Disclaimer: This really isn't a proper answer either, but the question really isn't about hardware recommendations and more a general question that would be easily researched.
Please note, this is answer is for the Dell Inspiron 15-5558, which hopefully is the same as the OP has.       Is my laptop compatible to upgrade to SSD ?   Yes, as you can see in the following picture, the drive positioning was clearly designed to make the drive easily replacable.  source: NotebookCheck.com (German)     What dimensions of SSD will be compatible ?   The article from which the image is, claims that a Toshiba MQ01ABD100 is used which is a 2.5 inch HDD, therefore you need a (standard) 2.5 inch SATA-SSD.      Which SSD will be best ?   My default recommendation here is the Samsung SSD 850 Evo 1TB for 340USD on amazon.com.  There are two reasons to pick a different drive:   You want to write a lot to your drive, that is more than 60-80GB on average per day for the next few years, then you want to use the Pro version of the above SSD which while having the same write-limit warranty, uses SSD technology more resistant to overwrite damage (MLC vs TLC). You don't want to pay as much because you don't need as much storage, in which case you can simply go with a smaller drive (they come in the full range from 256GB to 4TB).
I am bit late though thought of sharing the idea of renting MacInCloud  The above company offers Mac rentals starting at $1 per hour and $20.00 per month which is more than sufficient for individual mobile app developers like me. It is not worth spending money on buying a mac machine. Please follow the link for further details, it offers comprehensive plans for advanced users as well.
I would suggest the Acer.  Reasons.  It has an SSD which improves boot times. It comes stock with 16GB of RAM, which is the most you will ever need for gaming.   Also, some applications, including possibly Android Studio, will benefit from the extra RAM and the SSD speeds.  With the Acer, you get more bang for the buck without having to upgrade.  Seeing as the two GPUs both have 4GB of VRAM, I would imagine that the significance of performance is negligible, after all, these are not the top end of GPUs.  Hope that helps.
Since this question has been asked some time ago, I feel, I should update you on the actual accepted solution, see below.    I have found, that M-Disc (Millennial Disc) technology could allegedly endure up to 1000 years.  A little comparison image:    I have bought the below Blu-Ray writer; you can find their compatibility with M-Disc DVD/Blu-Ray 4.7/25/50/100 GB on this page.  My final pick of the writer was: ASUS BW-16D1H-U PRO  It is noteworthy to say, that any Blu-Ray reader can read these M-Discs.
Any recommendation?   Essentially, anything that has a Nvidia Geforce GTX 1070 or GTX 1080 will work for you. However due to your budget, finding a 1070-based model is more likely. The other caveats that you have to look out for are the 16GB of RAM that you specified, the SSD and that the CPU (most likely an Intel model) has HQ or HK at the end of the name and not U, because the latter would indicate a dual-core CPU limited to 28W or 15W power-consumption as opposed to a quad-core at 45W. Any laptop that satisfies these above constraints should work.   Beyond that, note that you probably want to clean the fans every now and then (1x a month if you can) to make sure the air can flow and cool the system properly, so that you don't get reduced performance or sudden heat-caused shutdowns.  Because I have to, I'll make a generic recommendation fitting your budget:  The Asus ROG GL502VS-FY042T:   It features an Nvidia GTX 1070 GPU (-> 8GB of VRAM) meaning it's about the best you can get from a 1500â‚¬ laptop It features a standard quad-core 45W Skylake laptop CPU: the i7-6700HQ It features 16GB of RAM It features a 512GB SSD paired with a 1TB HDD It's priced at 1499â‚¬ (at least in Germany, should be similar in other european countries)
There are a few key things you need to look out for:    You need 8-16GB of RAM As the card draws 250W max and the rest of the system probably draws the same, you need a 600W+ PSU that has at least one 6 and one 8 pin power connector. Your case needs to fit a 10.5" long, double-height graphics card (which is a pretty standard size).   Anything else is essentially up to you.  Now I've picked a few parts (w/o OS, optical drives and peripherals, if you need them, this needs tweaking) as a generic recommendation satisfying the above constraints, highlights:   an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 processor a 128GB Samsung PCIe SSD an all-in-one water cooling system for easier cleaning   The part list:  PCPartPicker part list: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/FM9Hyf Price breakdown by merchant: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/FM9Hyf/by_merchant/  CPU: AMD - Ryzen 7 1700X 3.4GHz 8-Core Processor  ($329.59 @ SuperBiiz)  CPU Cooler: Corsair - H60 54.0 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler  ($54.99 @ Newegg)  Motherboard: Gigabyte - GA-AB350-GAMING 3 ATX AM4 Motherboard  ($99.89 @ OutletPC)  Memory: G.Skill - Ripjaws V Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-2666 Memory  ($111.99 @ Newegg)  Storage: Samsung - 960 EVO 250GB M.2-2280 Solid State Drive  ($127.49 @ OutletPC)  Storage: Western Digital - Caviar Blue 1TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive  ($46.88 @ OutletPC)  Video Card: NVIDIA - Titan Xp 12GB Video Card  Case: NZXT - S340 (Black) ATX Mid Tower Case  ($69.99 @ B&H)  Power Supply: EVGA - SuperNOVA NEX 650W 80+ Gold Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply  ($89.89 @ OutletPC)  Total: $930.71 Prices include shipping, taxes, and discounts when available Generated by PCPartPicker 2017-08-19 10:20 EDT-0400
Yes you can, because they are just hard drive without a magnetic disk and spindle. They all are of same size 2.5", which can easily fit in your laptops HDD housing.   If you've got DVD drive and you feel its not much used then get a DVD SSD Caddy. They come in 2 sizes which depends on your laptop. Bigger one sizes 12.7mm and the smaller sizes 9.5mm. This will allow you to run both the hardisks parallel.  I got Acer 5830TG, loaded with 6gigs of ram, core i5, nvidia GT540m, Samsung EVO 850 120 GB as primary and Seagate 500 GB as secondary.  Samsung EVO 850 is good in R/W performance. This one is a TLC flash equipped. Which can make a write of limit up to 95 TB but in this competition others stops at ~30 TB . At the same time other SSD manufacturers TLC's write speed performance can bring to their knees. They only go up to 30-90mb, hardly to reach the highest peak. But Samsung provides 500+ mb speed performance in R/W both. Which averages to 250mb to 300mb. That's really a great performance as compared to its competitor's in TLC range.  we can push our self to spend extra bucks to get a quality product. :-)
Both the machines are upgradable to the same extent.    SSD can be added. More RAM can be added.   Now, Acer comes with the higher specs  in ram and SSD. Which extremely reflects your performance.  Now buying is dependent on pricing of the machines. If Acer comes at the same cost of dell or slightly higher or lower then simply choose the Acer blind folded.  Because 8 gig stick and a 128 SSD disk sums around INR 11k in India. Which is really a big amount.  Then comes the brand, If you're not brand conscious, I hope you will pick the right one. :-)
Please see my accepted answer here for an overview of XMP and OC in relation to memory.  This Corsair Vengeance Pro DDR3 memory is probably a good choice for you. It comes in varying colors, which are all roughly around 150 EUR, or the Red version, which is 130 EUR.  This is the RAM that I actually have in my personal machine, and I have never had any issues whatsoever.   However, if you are set on purchasing the HyperX brand, then take the faster RAM speeds incase you want to use the XMP functionality at a later date.  RAM is expensive at the moment so around 8GB per DIMM should be fine for future upgrades.
Would a professional GPU or gaming GPU be better for light gaming?   I'll list the key differences between professional and gaming GPUs so you ccan better understand what you need and why:   Professional GPUs are much more expensive They come with error-checking and correcting VRAM (slower, more relieable even though faults are rare) They come with special drivers which have special boosts for certain creative programs They support 10-bit color output via OpenGL   As you don't care about the last three points, it is a gaming GPU for you.     Or do I even need a GPU?   You have picked two Intel Xeon E5s. These do not come with a graphics chip on the die, so you will need a dedicated GPU if you don't want atrocious graphics performance, which will be really annoying even for light desktop activity.     Do "retro" games rely more on CPU or GPU power.   I'd say they rely less on the GPU than modern games, however you don't need to worry about the CPU with your current configuration.   I've looked at the games and it seems like you need a graphics card that has like 1GB of VRAM to be good in all of them. Depending on the offers you can find, something like a 750, a 950 or a 1050 should all be able to do the job well, these cards are about 100 USD on amazon, so you can probably find them a little bit cheaper elsewhere.
In general if you can afford the Â£50 more and it doesn't hurt much then you're going to get this much more performance, or let's say Â£25 worth more performance if you want to be a bit more critical about Intel's pricing model.  Here is a comparison of both models on Intel's site: https://ark.intel.com/en/compare/95443,95451  There is just a difference in clock speed, but if you have workloads where a little extra performance matters and you can process more data in the same mount of time or get work done a tad quicker then that may be worth Â£50 and depending on the maker and model the resale value may be a bit higher (well, I doubt it is in this case, I was thinking of Macs, ProBooks and Thinkpads). It won't make a notable difference with regards to gaming, authoring office/tex documents or compiling typical student programming projects. Workloads like complex/slow video/image analysis and encoding or compiling lots of big software projects (like a lot of Linux packages from source) will benefit a bit.  The chassis looks fine from what I can tell, there should be little risk that the faster processor overheats and becomes slower than the other chip as has happened on some bad (ultrabook) designs in the past.  If you are looking for the best performance and you can wait a little longer than you may want to look for the recently announced Intel 8000 series processors. The iGPU was re-branded from HD to UHD but is mostly the same (expect only very tiny refinements, if at all) but all of the announced models have 4 cores and 8 threads instead of 2 cores and 4 threads as the i5/i7-7000 series mobile processors have. But you will have to wait a few weeks or probably months for these to be available in updated products and the initial prices will be higher than these offers for a while.
Here in the USA you can buy a ThinkPad x200 with no HDD for well under $100 on eBay. Boost the memory to 8GB or better and add an mstata SSD and you'll be working with a fast machine. Install the Chromium browser and you can make use of all the Google apps and extensions just like you would on the Chromebook. Battery life is fantastic, just get a used 9 cell and install TLP, tp-smapi and acpi-call.   On the other hand, Chromebooks are amazing, and you can easily run Arch on an SD Card through crouton. With the Asus C202 you'll have the same durability as you would with the ThinkPad. The downside is that you'll have far less memory than you would on the x220.
A not so recent model of a Chromebook where audio is working would be nice, you can use this table to find suitable models. A model like the N22 with 4GB would be able to do the tasks you listed and match the Thinkpad in resolution and size while being slimmer and lighter, but the Thinkpad takes the lead in performance, durability and repair-ability. In this price range I would, like you, gravitate towards the Thinkpad and try to make the most out of it.  Models like the Asus C302 were released for twice the amount of money you want to spend when you posted your question. I have it and it's a fantastic device if you can get your hands on it. It is very slim size and has a 1080p touch screen which makes sense with the recently released Playstore for Chrome OS in stable. The Thinkpad still takes the lead in durability and Linux compatibility though and its CPU is probably still faster than the passive cooled low-power counterparts, non-replaceable memory and slow eMMC storage.  Where Chromebooks win due to slimmer chassis and drawing less power a used x220 makes up for it in performance and reliability. If size and weight is not an issue then you should get the Thinkpad and probably a second battery.
The X220 (unsure about X220s) can take 16GB RAM, and has a slot you can use for an mSATA harddisk, in addition to a standard 2.5" disk. It has superior cooling (large copper heatsinks), and mine never gets too hot. You can extend it with a dock or ultrabase, and give it additional drives and batteries. A 9-cell will give you 10-12 hours on spartan settings. USB3 is available with an expresscard, so it's not lacking, it just requires an ebay purchase. I've used mine for years, and it doesn't even show signs of wear and tear.   You can repair an X220 forever; if a part fails, you can get a new one. None of mine have failed, but I wouldn't have to spend much to buy a defective X220 for a bucketload of spare parts.  Chromebooks... are funny. They are light, at least. The X220 weighs 1.6kg with a 6-cell battery. Stick it in your bag, and you won't notice the weight. If you have absolutely no muscles, perhaps a chromebook is the best option. Girls also seem to favour macbooks and chromebooks because they're pretty like flowers, so there's that.
To be honest, the only phone on that website I would personally recommend is probably your first suggestion, the Samsung J3.  Samsung devices have good build quality and performance overall, they also last a long time, from personal experience.  Otherwise, I would most likely recommend the LG smartphones, either of the two below:   LG X210 K7 LG K350 K8   To be reasonable, the General Mobile (GM) phones dont look too bad on paper, its just that i have never heard of them.  My personal advice would be to buy a Motorola G5 and get it shipped to your country if you are looking for a pure and fast android experience.  Hope this helps.
I cant go ahead and recommend any particular devices, as I have never owned one, but I think what you are looking for is a   Duplex Scanner  I should imagine anything with a well know name will do the job for you. Im not sure there is any specific device that actually knows document size/length/no. of pages without some kind of user input, which wasnt what you were looking for.  On the other hand, duplex scanning will do that for you, giving that no document is more than 2 pages long (double sided).  Hope that makes sense and helps.
Software-Solution This might not be the same type of product you are seeking however it is a full-proof approach to software KVM(A). You could try Synergy or one of it's many alternatives that handle KVM at the network level. I've used Synergy for many years on my dev box with a configuration of two laptops, two towers, and a CCTV which runs Ubuntu desktop. The only downside is that Synergy is no longer a free approach. It seems Symless is going through some growing pains as they ramp up their new company.  Source: https://symless.com/synergy  Hardware Solution If you are unable to use Synergy, StarTech makes a nice two port solution. I'm not quite sure about your budget since you stated "doesn't break the bank", but this one will run you $292.00 USD. At any rate shop around on NewEgg before making a KVM purchase, and beware of the triplite generics.  Note: as far as output goes, you can always find a converter from DVI to HDMI vice versa, and even VGA to DVI/HDMI.

SSD is your best choice for top notch performance. If storage is your higher priority then go for magnetic disks.
Either CPU will be fine but for heavy editing or rendering workloads you'd be better served getting a Ryzen 7 1700. The extra process threads will shorten your production downtime.  This will really end up being a budget-driven decision for you. If this machine is to fuel a hobby and your budget is on the tight side, get the Ryzen 5. If you're building this for professional production and intend to use it to earn income, then absolutely get the Ryzen 7 over the Ryzen 5 if your budget allows.  You could also wait a few months, as AMD is rumored to have a new professional-grade lineup of processors using the Zen architecture between Q3 and Q4, but that depends on your timeline.
As Andy mentioned in the comments, this is an old AMD board. The FM2 socket is a few generations old at this point. You're going to have to find a used CPU that is compatible with the board, as AMD no longer manufactures any CPU that is compatible with it.  You can find a list of supported CPU models by looking for your motherboard's user manual online, or viewing a compiled list on the wikipedia article regarding the FM2 socket, or by using a site such as www.pcpartpicker.com. Good places to look for old hardware are Ebay and a community on Reddit called "r/hardwareswap" (without quotes).
If you're willing to sort the documents as suggested in the comments by Edward Nunn, then my answer here should be of help to you:  Document Scanner with specific modes  You can definitely find cheaper units that don't use features like Auto Document Feed (ADF) and whatever else you don't need, but if you need to get this project done fast in a business setting then I'd recommend something with ADF at least. Considering the apparent scale of your project, the cost of additional man hours put in due to the absence of those features would probably approach or exceed the cost of just buying the scanner.    Original Question From Link:  We are in search for a business document scanner with following scan options, all done over a ADF.  Simplex: front side  Duplex: front and back side   Simplex scan of every sheet to its own PDF. Simplex scan of all sheets to one PDF. Duplex scan of every sheet to its own PDF (One PDF with front and back side). Duplex scan of all sheets to one PDF.   We talked with a supplier of ours and got a Brother ADS-2800W from him, but its incapable of mode nr 3. After some research and getting back with the Brother Support, none of Brothers Scanner is apparently capable of nr 3.  Of course we also tried the usual ways (google, product comparison websites and all those "Best Scanners of >>insert year here<<"-Reviews) but none of those gave the information needed or didnt comply with at least one criteria.  Criteria:   ADF A4 sheet size Modes listed above Desktop size WLAN / LAN Save to SMB Network Share Price of 600â‚¬ / $ top   Thanks in advance for any kind of help!    Full answer below:  My office recently grabbed an HP ScanJet 3000 S3. It's a bit above your price range (closer to $800-900), but I've been in charge of developing our scan process and I can tell you with confidence that it does everything you listed.  We specifically got it to digitize old paper records, and it is set up at a small stand-alone desk with a computer.   ADF = Included A4 sheet size = Included, also has other custom paper sizes. Smaller sheets can sometimes have trouble being grabbed by the feed mechanism, but it's functional. Modes listed above = All included. Desktop size = Fits on a pretty tiny desk with plenty of room to work. Very space efficient.  WLAN / LAN = This feature exists but you have to buy a $40 wireless adapter that is made special just for this unit, and you can only scan to mobile devices using this method. I know don't even get me started right now, but this thing works and finding a wireless workaround solution was extremely simple since we work from a server platform. We returned the stupid $40 USB dongle. Save to SMB Network Share = Included. Price of 600â‚¬ / $ top = Nope.   It's far from a perfect solution and you usually won't find me recommending products that don't fit the user's question, but we had a particularly long and arduous experience trying to find something that would fit our needs. I see similar conditions in your post. We had to make a few compromises, but at the end of the day we needed something and this little headache of a scanner made our project possible. Perhaps it can do the same for you.  I can definitely tell you that unless you're looking for something used, duplex auto-document feed scanners that can handle even a 50 page count stack at a time don't exist for under $600. Well, they may exist, but there wasn't anything I found that was suitable and trustworthy enough for business use.
Depending on how much you want to spend I would say Raspberry Pi would be the way to go as you will be able to install a nice OS that could be tailored to what you are after, or if you would farther have a slightly easier system there are a number of Zotac mini PCâ€™s that pack a lot of hardware in a tiny form factor.  As for the controller if you have a look about there are a number of different options such as small wireless touch pads that could be used or you could find something like a windows media controller and see if there are some tweaks to get it to control the PC.
I would suggest the 32GB model of the Motorola Moto G5  All Motorola phones come with as clean android as you are going to find on the market (compared to the Google Pixel) and they have very good hardware specifications, check in the link above.  Its screen size is 5 inches, the only hardware button is the home button, and it has an audio jack. Decent camera too.
I have the Nikon 1 J5 and I get some great photos out of it.   It's around $300 and comes with loads of in-camera effects (toy camera, wide angle, colour selection so on) and considering it's a mirror-less camera it captures really hi-res photos, plus its not a pain to lug around!
I have used a few different models of Scansnap from Fujitsu and they have been great.  They are expensive (4-5 hundred $), but well worth it in my opinion. If you put a document with writing on a single side, and the back of the document is anything other than white, it will scan it as well. I just delete the white pages from the pdf after.  If you put in 5 pages, all double sided, it feeds them through a single time, and gives you back a 10 page PDF.  :)  https://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=scansnap&tag=googhydr-20&index=aps&hvadid=182034174446&hvpos=1t2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=16899866166753887597&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9009667&hvtargid=kwd-117955977&ref=pd_sl_361fwhr797_b_p20
Can i use both HDMI and VGA at the same time to extend the screen?   Yes, this will work fine. The card supports multi-monitor configurations and has the outputs you have said you will be using. As far as hardware goes, there is no reason that your proposed configuration would not work.    Edit: In response to your comments, here's my recommendation: https://www.amazon.com/Gigabyte-DDR3-2GB-Graphics-GV-R724OC-2GI-REV2-0/dp/B00JRSPXMQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1504293362&sr=8-1&keywords=amd+R9  An R7 240 has all the ports you need, no adapters necessary, and it's a little more modern as far as a multi-monitor workstation / non-gaming card goes. It's not the newest thing out there but it's recent enough that it'll last longer than the card you posted about. It's also got better power efficiency than the card in the OP while meeting all of the required specs.  If that particular one sells out or something, you should be able to find some pretty similar cards by comparing the spec sheets. It may also help to compare the release dates for this card model to others, so you can find something from a similar generation. I'm recommending a card from around this time specifically because it will give you a good balance of pricing and longevity.  To answer your other questions, if you were to buy one of the more expensive cards you mentioned in the comments then I have two pieces of information to contribute. First, an RX 550 or a GTX 1050Ti is more power than you need, don't waste the money. If you do want to get one of those, then you just need a simple DVI -> VGA adapter. It's not an active adapter since the signal is going from digital to analog, the other way around you'd need a lightly more expensive active adapter.
There really aren't all that many options for this out there.  Newegg has one: the Silverstone ECWA2-Lite.  It uses simple pass-through connectors to your computer's PCIe slot and internal USB header, so it runs at full speed, needs no additional drivers, and should be compatible with any mini-PCIe card.  It's only got two antennas, though.
This is a very bad idea unless you can verify with 100% certainty that the USB-C cable can carry the same amperage and voltage as the laptop charging cable. Missing the mark on this by charging your battery on a connection that has too much or too little juice can damage the battery and present a fire hazard. OEM laptops should always be used with a properly specced charging cable, preferably from the manufacturer.
Couple things at play here, so I'll try to offer what I think would be the best comprehensive solution.  First, you want a 27-30" panel minimum, as far as size. It will allow for the monitor to be placed at a healthy visual distance without reducing how much area it takes up within his visual field, similar to how a 50" TV looks "smaller" when it's mounted on the wall 10' away from you. You also want that extra screen space to be able to adjust any accessibility software.   Examples of accessibility software for Windows would be the native Narrator software, NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) which is free open-source software, or Window-Eyes for MS Office or whatever the equivalent is called now. There are other options out there as well if none of these work for your dad.  Depending on if and how you implement any zoom features to enlarge text, resolution might come into play. If you're going to enlarge text to 150% or larger, I'd recommend a 1440p display over a 1080p. My reasoning here is that as you enlarge text the lines might become blurred or altered due to the ratio between the desired image size and the pixels-per-inch count. In my experience the higher definition displays tend to display enlarged text more clearly.  Finally, I'll link the following thread about programming font options below:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4689/recommended-fonts-for-programming  You can also find good lists by searching around the internet if that link dies. I recommend one of these because coders usually prefer fonts that have a high level of distinctiveness and differentiation between characters, which minimizes the chance that you will mistake a 1 for an l for a ] and so on. This is, for obvious reasons, also very helpful to the visually impaired. I believe that there are Chrome and Firefox extensions that will try to apply a given font to websites as well, so those might be worth looking into if your dad browses online a lot.  If you'd like to provide a list of desired specs and a budget, I'd be happy to look around for some models that would be a good fit. Best of luck!
Just having metal won't necessarily make your laptop more durable (It depends more on construction and some laptop manufacturers put a metal coating over plastic), but if you want to maximize your durability you could consider something like a toughbook (which is constructed with a magnesium metal alloy).  They are usually around the $1000 price range and have pretty good specs as well. As it happens there is one on sale at Newegg for $500 (MSRP $3,800). It hits all the sweet spots in your requirements too.   It features a Intel Core i5-3320M, so the cpu isn't exactly breaking records, however; it has 8gb of DDR3 RAM as well as a bonus of 128gb SSD (which in my experience makes even underpowered cpu computers quite snappy). It comes with Windows 7 Pro, but you can always buy Windows 10 for it, if you want the latest and greatest from Windows 10 (small optimizations, windows apps, cortana search).  These things are supposed to be REALLY tough, and I believe that the US military uses these types of laptops in the field. You'll have a tough time breaking one of these with daily use.  In addition, the official sales website claims:     In addition, a 6-foot drop & IP65 certified design with a full magnesium alloy case, helps to ensure that the Toughbook 19 will stand up to the most rigorous environments.      Tested by national independent third party lab following MIL-STD-810G Method 516.6 Procedure IV for transit drop test and IEC 60529 Sections 13.4, 13.6.2, 14.2.5 and 14.3 for IP65   It also claims to come with a gratuitous battery life of 10 hours.
I'm interested in this as well. So far I have found a few promising mini PCs that are somewhat popular, such as as the Gigabyte Brix.  Anandtech's review of a Bay Trail Gigabyte Brix shows a power consumption of 5.79 W at idle and 17.28 W under load. The ECS Liva looks even better, with a Techspot review claiming the ECS goes from 4 watts at idle to 10 watts at full load   I'm not sure if that will satisfy your needs, and there may be drawbacks if your display has a overly high resolution.
It's virtually certain that no board meeting your requirements exists: you've got three mutually-contradictory requirements.  Registered memory is a technique for increasing the amount of RAM a board can support, at the cost of increased access latency.  Load-reduced memory is a different technique for doing the same thing.  Additionally, slowing down the memory clock can be done on any board to increase the memory capacity.  Any board where the manufacturer has added the extra circuitry needed to support registered or LR memory is one where they've already reached the limits from slowing down the memory clock.  I've found a scattering of SuperMicro server boards that support both registered memory and DDR4-2400, but nothing faster, and I haven't found anything that supports both registered and LR memory.
I might get crucified for posting this but based on your requirements the device you are looking for is called a palm pilot.  There are several other knock off versions of this device.  The original Palm Pilot was released in 1996/1997.  They have a stylus.  You have the ability to use handwriting, handwriting to typed text and peck at an onscreen keyboard.  Additionally they also have Optional Keyboards if you are not a stylus type.  Since they have been out of production for about a decade the only place you can find one is Ebay.  I don't know if you can get software support for them but it seems there are still some die hards out there that still use this device.
I recommend the Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus, available at Amazon for Â£149.99 + Free shipping  Like Motorola's Moto G series, the Swift 2 has a relatively unadulterated Android experience. In this case, you have the option of sticking with the CyanogenMod 13, which it ships with, upgrading to their official ROM, currently at 7.1.2, or installing LineageOS.  Storage is 32 GB, which should be sufficient for most, especially if microSD expansion and cloud storage are taken advantage of. RAM is similarly generous, with 3 GB, meaning multitasking and cache won't be a problem.  The camera sensor is a decent 16 MP, though the dynamic range is unspectacular. The aperture (f/2.0) is larger than most phones at this price, though as can be expected, there is no Optical Image Stabilization. Battery life is mediocre at best, though some users report 5 to 7 hours SoT.  The display is a undistinguished 720p LCD. It has most of the usual extras, such as NFC, USB-C and Speed Charging. The fingerprint sensor is on the back of the phone â€“ though normally handy, it may be less convenient if you usually leave it lying on a table, â€“ and unfortunately the second SIM slot only supports 2G and is obstructed if you choose to install a microSD card for storage.  Overall, the Wileyfox Swift 2 Plus is a solid and stylish phone for the sub-Â£200 segment, and I doubt you'll go wrong with it.  Techradar review
You kind of answered your own question here, the only things that fit those specs will be a used macbook or a used Lenovo T5XX series or higher from within the past 3-4 years. You'll likely need to source a new battery and the SSD (Lenovo only, for a Mac you're SOL on these most likely), but everything else on the spec list you can find by searching on Craigslist or Ebay and having some patience. Finding used product listings that actually apply to you is going to be impractical at best without location information, and timing is hard in that capacity as well. By the time anyone finds something, posts it here, and you see it, the item may well be sold.  You could also take this list into a few local PC shops, any major metro area these days has at least a few repair spots that also sell used hardware. You'll often find them advertising on used goods websites as well.  The factory-installed Win7 could be a bit of an issue. A lot of used hardware resellers will sell a laptop with a scrubbed hard drive and a fresh installation of Windows. There's also the potential for hidden malware and other issues, so I'd highly recommend getting a laptop with an OEM Windows key (the laptop will have this as long as it shipped with Windows). You'll then want to clean the hard drive yourself, preferably using DiskPart, and install a fresh copy of Windows that you download directly from Microsoft. This will avoid most issues with malware. If you get a laptop from a shop, odds are all this will be done for you but you can definitely ask about it.
A tad over budget at $165, but you might find it cheaper elsewhere.  I am on my fourth Ulefone and have been happy with them all. I bought my first because it was the first 64-bit smartphone & have continued to upgrade ever since.  Some are sub Â£150, but I am recommending the Ulefoen Power :     Operating system : Android 7.0 CPU: MTK6750T, Octa-Core 1.5GHz   Storage: 4GB RAM +64GB ROM with Max. Expansion Supported 256GB   Memory  Card: TF Card   SIM : Dual sim dual standby, Nano SIM +Nano SIM / TF   WiFi : 2.4/5GHz  802.11a/b/g/n.

It only has 4gB, which you might not like, but a cheap SD card will fix that. I install everything on SD and have not seen a performance hit.  The 13MP and 8MP cameras should please you; it is rare to see such a good front camera.  The main point for me is that stonking 6050 mAH battery, which means that I charge it every 4 days or so (although they claim Standby Time: 1160 Hours).  I showed a few previous Ulefones to chaps at the office, who bought one and have been happy with them.
You might want to look at Wacom Bamboo Spark/Slate/Folio  http://www.wacom.com/en-de/products/smartpads/bamboo-folio  or even simpler one of those pens that convert your handwriting into digital format like these (just google top result)  http://www.toptenreviews.com/electronics/family/best-digital-pens/  and then use iPad or computer to review, search edit etc.? This is rather cheap and easily available, if it suits your needs.  If you want something like the microsoft surface, there are ereaders that allow you to write on them, like sony DPT-RP1 for example or onyx has one as well. I don't know how they perform in terms of note taking because I have not researched them as they are very expensive. I strongly belive that they will become cheap and will be everywhere in the not too distant future.   Alternatively, you could simply use the cheapest tablet you can find that supports a digitizer pen (or maybe even just a simple stylus. I don't know how well that works) like the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.
The Liberty Computer is a small, credit card sized computer that is designed to use minimal power as well as offer the highest standard of privacy. In this reviewer video and interview with the developer the reviewer reports under 3 W idle usage.  In this Crowd Supply page the computer is called the EOMA68 Micro-Desktop computer. The cost is 65 dollars pre-order but is projected to drop to 30 dollars on the market.
Instead of relying on theoretical considerations, it is wise to take into account real measured hash rates. Fortunately, since many tech sites have taken upon themselves to do these benchmarks, and publish the results, you do not have to actually purchase the cards to get hard numbers for yourself. These numbers can reveal certain unexpected deviations from the theoretically expected hash rates: For example many miners have found an unexplained decrease in hash rate on the newer Polaris GPUs at larger DAG sizes. (1)(2) This can mean trouble over the long term, as those cards become obsolete for mining before paying for themselves.  Looking at the benchmark results, we can immediately see some interesting figures. The older R9 390/Xs perform superbly, and do not appear to degrade at higher DAG sizes. It's somewhat surprising to see the GTX 1070 above the 1080, something we would never know just looking at the 1080's higher core count and memory bandwidth. It appears that GDDR5 has superior latency characteristics for mining than the GDDR5X used in the 1080 (Another reason spec sheets do not tell the whole story: latency information is missing). The GTX 1060 also performs adequately, though for future proofing, the 6 GB version is a must.  Overall, due to the higher power consumption and lower availability of the older Radeon cards, although the R9 390 is a viable candidate, I do not heavily recommend it. Essentially, the decision is between the 1070 and the 1060. The choice between the two essentially boils down to how much capital you plan on investing into your mining gear. Since for a more expensive GPU, the rest of the system makes up for a smaller proportion of total costs, I would recommend the GTX 1070 as a first choice and the GTX 1060 or R9 390/X GPUs as secondary options.
The reference document for this is PCI-E Card electromechanical specification. I believe the relevant figure is 6.2:    As you can see, the distance you're asking about is not specified at all, because the lug (referred to as "detail F" in the figure) has no connectivity and is present to prevent insertion of PCI-E cards into PCI slots. It doesn't have to be positioned at a precise distance from the bracket for the card to work.  What is specified is the distance between the card bracket and the notch inside the connector, which is 59,05mm.
A Lenovo T420s if you like the old IBM keyboards (like model M), or T430s or above if you like the island-type keyboards. They can all fit extra batteries, larger batteries, and are easy to upgrade and repair.   Also look at the T520 and T530 (and above) for the same reasons - these have bigger displays. They typically feature only an intel HD graphics chip.

I'd say a laptop is the best choice. Here's why:   A laptop can be used to develop on several platforms A Chromebook has been made specifically to surf the web, hence a laptop can be expected to give a better experience. Laptops have good storage space options, processors and RAM. And as Chromebooks have been made for the internet men, in mind, it doesn't have such great options. Even if a Chromebook does have a lot of storage options and RAM, you won't be fully able to utilize it. A laptop on the other hand, will allow you not only to develop but also to virtualize other operating systems.   Some recommendations: Amazon.com under â‚¬400 recommendations Techradar Linux Recommendations
You could upgrade to a quad core processor and 4GB of RAM if you intend to keep the motherboard. CPUs codenamed Yorkfield were the latest you could get for the 775 platform (they are about USD 40 on ebay), but make sure that you can fit a sufficient cooler in your case to cool the additional 2 cores and higher clock speed. I don't see a reason why you shouldn't be able run SATA SSDs with this machine, the only limitation appears to be the 2 RAM slots, 4 would be better I think.  Here is the product page for the board: https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/GA-G31M-S2L-rev-10#sp
The CPU cooler that is available for bundling on amazon is the Corsair H115i, which is a water cooler with 2x 140mm fans (for cooling the hot water coming from the CPU). This is the most powerful of Corsair liquid coolers and would have been my recommendation indeed. However one needs to see first whether such a 280mm radiator fits in the case first.  Right now, there are exactly 6 Threadripper-compatible mainboards on the market, of which the following 3 are avaible on Amazon.com:   The MSI X399 Gaming Pro Carbon AC (at 350 USD) The ASUS Prime X399-A (at 350 USD) The GIGABYTE X399 AORUS Gaming 7 (at 390 USD)   All of which satisfy the following:   They have 8 RAM slots for a total maximum of 128GB of RAM They have at least 2 full-speed PCIe 3.0 x16 slots They have at least 2 M.2 slots with a PCIe 3.0 x4 connection They have at least 2 USB 3.1 Gen2 ports They have at least 6 SATA-3 ports They have at least 4 Fan headers (the PSU will likely have some as well)   Form-factor wise the ASUS is EATX and the other two are standard ATX sized. Connectivity-wise all but the Gigabyte one have Intel GBit Ethernet (the Gigabyte one has a RivetNetworks controler) and all but the ASUS one have WiFi capabilities.  So given they all satisfy all relevant constraints I could think of, I think the MSI X399 Gaming Pro Carbon AC, despite its ridiculous name, is the best pick out of the three because it has the most standard form-factor and sits at the cheapest price-point.
I recommend getting a secondhand Core 2 Quad Q9650 or Core 2 Quad X9650 (for your purposes, they're all the same CPU, just with different branding).  This will give you almost double the single-threaded performance, and four times the multi-threaded performance.  You can find them on Ebay for $20-$60.  You'll also want to upgrade your RAM to 4 GB ($60 or so), install a 64-bit version of Windows so you can use all of it, and install a SSD.  Your board is compatible with SATA SSDs, though since the connectors are SATA II rather than SATA III, you won't get the best possible performance.
You can install the modified s771 CPU. Modified xeons is much cheaper with the same performance.  Even if you have the SATA 2 in you system you can use ssd for the swap and it will be as a RAM.
In September 2017, the pickings are still slim for high-wattage multi-C-port USB chargers.  Google provides a low-wattage two-C-port charger here : https://store.google.com/us/product/usb_c_dual_port_charger?hl=en-US  Most phones which will charge happily with A-to-C cables from traditional high-wattage multi-A-port chargers.  I suspect consumers will try and plug multiple 87W MacBook Pros into their 100W chargers, and blame the charger for not keeping up.
Assuming price is not a concern, neither one has much of an advantage over the other for your purposes.   A powered-down laptop hard drive is reasonably shock-resistant: the 500g rating is roughly equivalent to falling off a table onto a concrete floor. A SSD has a much higher random-access speed than a hard drive, but backup and restore are mostly sequential-access operations, where SSDs don't have anywhere near as much of an edge. Hard drives have better long-term powered-off behavior.  A hard drive pulled out of storage will either power up properly, providing access to all its data, or not power up properly, requiring work by a data-recovery company to provide access to all the data.  A powered-off SSD will gradually lose data in an unrecoverable fashion after a few years.  This is mostly not an issue for you, since you plan to store the drives at low temperature (which reduces the data loss rate), and you plan to power them up periodically to update the contents. SSDs handle being turned off and on much better than hard drives do, but again, this is mostly not an issue: being power-cycled 50 times a year is well below the limits for a hard drive.   The big advantage hard drives have is still price: a 1TB external hard drive is about $60, while a similar-sized SSD is around $300.  Whichever way you choose to go, make sure your backup plan can handle the failure of one of your external drives.  There's no point in having a backup if the backup itself is a weak point.
Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (150$ with free shipping to the USA, no idea about possibly additional customs duty) and other Xiaomi devices. Note that some other Xiaomi devices are not supported by LinageOS. Unlocking rated (see question for meaning) good, but needs executable from vendor for Windows (bad). I couldn't find documentation on how many touch points are supported. This is a recent device, as opposed to most devices supported by LinageOS which are older.  Wileyfox Swift or the AFAIK worse Wileyfox Storm, but not newer devices (i.e. not Swift 2 or similar) from Wileyfox as they stopped their upstream support for LinageOS. Unlocking rated best with fastboot oem unlock. It has an SD card slot, supports 10 touch points, 2 SIM card slots. They are not manufactured any more so you can only buy them from resellers.  Huawei Honor 5X and other Huawei devices. Note that newer Huawei devices are not yet supported by LinageOS. Unlocking rated good with secret used with fastboot oem unlock SecretHere. I couldn't find documentation on how many touch points are supported.  There are probably more devices which fit your requirements, especially when buying older ones. Some phones can not be found on e.g. Amazon, but are much easier to come by from AliExpress, though you may need to additionally pay customs duty. LinageOS has a list with devices that they officially support. The installation instructions from LinageOS explain in more detail what steps are needed to unlock each device.  Because of your requirement for an SD card slot the following ones do not qualify which otherwise would:   Google branded phones which are unlocking rated best, but which also cost much more. OnePlus 5 and other OnePlus devices are unlocking rated best, but also cost more.
EVGA graphics cards have possibly the best warranty policy. This is why I will recommend you an EVGA card (the cards in this case all have the -KR suffix and thus limited 3 year warranty). Performance-wise there is little difference (single-digit per-cents) between the cards so the precise choice doesn't matter much.  So what do you actually want from a graphics card? Raw computation power (from Nvidia because Blender uses those cards better). Now there are two ways to provide this sort of power: Use 2 cheaper cards or use one beefy card. For gaming the case is clear on the second one. In this case it's close. Two GTX 1070s would provide roughl (up to a few per cent again) the same performance as one GTX 1080 Ti. However the 1080 Ti will draw less power overall, will perform better when gaming and will also provide you with 11GB of VRAM in total as opposed to 8GB (meaning more can be stored directly in the fast memory on the card). Also a single 1080Ti will likely be cheaper, leaving more room for other components.  So now that we know what you need, which model should you get? Amazon has 6 different EVGA 1080Ti cards. 1 "founder's edition", 2 with water cooling, 3 with air cooling. The water cooled cards are >$1100 and thus too expensive. I see the founder's edition card critically because it has only one fan and will probably be quite loud becaus of the high RPM required.  This leaves us with the following three air cooled cards:   EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti FTW3 GAMING (at 800USD) EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti SC2 GAMING (at 770USD) EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti SC Black Edition GAMING (at 770USD)   Given the minimal pricing difference here, I would actually recommend the FTW3 card, because it has 3 fans as opposed to 2, meaning it probably will be cooled better than the other two (meaning it can run faster for longer). It also features slightly higher clocks meaning it's also faster by default.  On a technical note for the other components, this cards needs 2x8-pin power connectors and claims to draw 280W. Size-wise it's at 11.8" length and standard dual-slot size, which needs to be adjusted for when picking the case.
According to the manual, page 54 and onwards, you can assign a custom configuration to the scan button. There is a caveat in the manual that says you cannot scan via wireless using the button, but that's not a factor in your question.      Assigning Start Button Settings or Scan Jobs You can view or change the default scan settings when you scan using the start button on your scanner. You do this by accessing the scan jobs in the Document Capture Pro (Windows) or Document Capture (OS X) program.   The manual does not provide a screen shot of the page that would allow you to specify double sides, in the pp 54-55 region, but does show such a page elsewhere in the manual.   It is typical for scanner software to allow custom configuration of various buttons on the device. Mediocre software often omits such features.
I haven't heard of size limitations on a SATA card, but this is a pretty affordable ($30) card with 4 ports. You might have been looking at hardware RAID cards which arent needed unless you really want to do RAID 5 or 6. (These might have size limits) If you really need a RAID card look at this.
I ended up acquiring an almost new Corsair AX760i PSU which was sold ~115 USD, which is almost half its new price. It 80 PLUSÂ® Platinum Certified Fully-Modular PSU.  What I learned it that there are several class of energy conversion efficiency certifications. The 80 PLUS certification ensures that the energy conversion efficiency is at least 80%. Above 80% are further "80 Plus ..." certifications : Bronze (82%), Silver (85%), Gold (85%), Platinium (90%), Titanium (92%).  Some constructors have an online calculator to estimate the power consumption of the computer. Even with the several drives and expansion cards mentioned in my original post, the estimated consumption was around 360W. A very high supported wattage is useless for most users, at least for office users. However, high wattage PSUs usually have more cables. For instance, my 760 W power supply unit comes with 3 SATA cables, each with 4 SATA connectors, 4 PCI-e cables, and several other cables. It will be perfect for my motherboard which has 3 PCI-E sockets and as I can power 3 hard drives with independant cables.  In comparison, the 1200 Watts AX1200i comes with 4 SATA cables and 6 PCI-E cables. I believe that some of the high wattage units are also designed to adapt with some high end motherboards of the future, which will probably have more PCI-E sockets.  The are three kind of power supply units: - non modular - semi modular - fully modular The difference if is the cables are permanently attached to the PSU or if you can attach or remove them. A fully modular PSU allows to attach/detach all cables, whilst a semi-modular one has the main cables attached permanently and others than you can add/remove depending on your needs. The more modular the PSU, the more comfort, but also the higher the price. If you don't plan changes to your hardware, a non modular or semi modular PSU will suffice.  One thing to mention is tha high end PSUs seem coming with more advanced voltage regulation. For instance, according to the manual, the AXi serie from Corsair uses a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) which improves overall system stability and component reliability. They also have better fan control, as the fan is activated only when necessary.  From what I read, some manufacturers, like Seasonic produce supply units which are then commercialized by miscellaneous brands, like Corsair.
Your mainboard takes AMD Socket FM2/FM2+ CPUs.  That's a fairly old socket, designed for AMD's APU-series processors, so modern high-power CPUs aren't available for it.  The closest you're going to get to the performance of an i5-6600 is the A10-7890K, currently available from Newegg for $150.  It benchmarks about 10% slower than the i5-6600 for single-threaded work, and about 30% slower for multi-threaded.  This may or may not be sufficient for your purposes.
Most of AutoCAD is single-threaded. It does have a few multithreaded subprocesses here and there, but most of your actual waiting-on-the-computer time is going to be long single-threaded operations. That is in regards to the main GUI application, which you would probably be using most as a student. There is also a program installed with AutoCAD that can be found in its directory called accoreconsole.exe which is basically a commandline only version of AutoCAD that is multi-threaded.  That being said, it is sort of a moot point since you're not shelling out thousands for a workstation with many cores; leaving your options basically to an Intel Core i5 or i7. The difference between the i5 and i7 is that the i5 is cheaper and lacks hyperthreading, while the i7 is more expensive and features hyperthreading(which allows each core to run two separate threads simultaneously). If budget allows, I'd opt for the i7. At work, I tried running the i7's in our mobile workstations without hyperthreading for a while. It did not seem to make a big difference in AutoCAD's performance, but the performance hit while multi-tasking was noticeable, so it was better to run with hyperthreading. The largest cost of those ($3000) mobile workstations was the NVidia Quadros that they had been ordered with. AFAIK, AutoCAD does not use any of the features that Quadros have that Geforces are lacking, so shelling out 5x as much for the Quadro is a waste for only working with AutoCAD. You may notice better performance with a Quadro while using Revit, 3DSMax, Maya, etc.  For a good deal, I would look for a laptop with an i7-4790k, as they are two generations old(cheap), and have single-core clock speeds on par with current generations. If you can find the 4790k in a laptop that also comes with an NVidia Geforce 1080, that would be perfect, but it will likely have a 980 at best given the generation. You will also need a good deal of memory, so shoot for the 4790k's maximum of 32GB. The last essential performance-related component would be your storage. I recommend getting two identical SSDs(256GBx2 or 512GBx2) and run them in RAID0. For peace of mind, you can pick up a third SSD and run in RAID5 so you have at least some sort of failsafe against a dead drive that contained your "big project". The last recommendation I have is get as big a screen as the remainder of your budget allows, screen space is very valuable in AutoCAD.  32GB of RAM and 3x SSDs would be leaning toward the mobile workstation sized laptops. The $3000 machines at work are a couple years old now, so they may be affordable now, especially used. They are the "HP Z-book 17". I personally don't recommend HP, as their business is mostly focused on selling service contracts to businesses, so there's likely something cheaper with equal stats from another manufacturer.  I am not familiar with what AMD has to offer for laptops, so I can't offer any credible alternatives to Intel/NVidia.
No specific laptop model recommendations, but heres a few tips. If you want the laptop to be able to run most programs made 10 years down the road, you'll want to pick up a newer model than a ThinkPad(Assuming you're running Windows). So..   Pick a model with newish hardware(specs). Commercial-grade laptops with anti-theft features will more often be constructed very sturdily. They often have a very sturdy central structural point for attaching a security cable to (for securing to a location in public or anywhere it is likely to be stolen). This structural point is always solid steel and often extends around the internal components so that a firm yank on the cable connection won't severely damage the laptop. Stray away from models that are designed around being "thin". A machine that allows overclocking will also allow underclocking, which can drastically improve component life-time. Try to shop within any given manufacturer's high-end. Their low and mid-grade products are often intentionally faulty. Get a laptop with a glass or acrylic screen. (As opposed to the poke-for-a-rainbow LCD screens.) Aside from being easier to clean, the solid screen surface helps avoid the slight bending that happens when opening the "lid". Also, a lid that opens smoothly with a constant heavier resistance to it usually holds the weight of the screen better. You don't want a laptop that tries to fold back flat whenever you set it down. Try out the keys on the keyboard, if pressing one side of a key causes the other side to lift, it is a flimsy keyboard with lots of uneven pressure being applied to the internal contact. These can eventually require pressing very hard to function, and then break in half, and may urge you to fist-a-bomb the whole board in frustration. Avoid anything with touch-activated buttons. That is, buttons that sense a finger and lack an actual button mechanism. These eventually fail all the time. Make sure there is at least one fan for the CPU. Fanless laptops run slow or run hot. Heavier usually means greater physical durability. Look for models that have metal trim around all the edges, and high quality plastic elsewhere. If at all possible, avoid a large central touchpad. This is becoming less of an issue as touchpad design improves, but constant rubbing of the palms on a touchpad will wear it down. Test the touchpad left and right mouse buttons just as you tested the keyboard. Lastly, no matter what you choose to buy, you'll need to take good care of it.    Letting a laptop sit on an uneven surface for a long time will cause the body to warp.  Using the computer with the screen facing the Sun all the time will cause display issues such as fading and discoloration. Overclocking can reduce CPU/GPU life, especially over 10 years. Applying shear force to a USB thumb-drive sticking out of your laptop can seriously damage the USB port(usually more damage to the drive). Running the laptop while plugged into AC power for long periods of time while the battery is at full charge will kill the battery(i.e., reduce the battery capacity to less than an hour). This can be tedious to avoid and can happen regardless due to a number of factors, so I would count on replacing the battery once or twice during those 10 years if battery life is important to you. Allowing the fan intake to become blocked(often by clothing or furniture, eventually by dust) will cause the CPU to run hot and eventually shut itself off. While most laptops can survive this happening quite often, I'm not sure it's going to help achieve a 10 year lifetime. Maybe once a year, open the laptop up and blow or vacuum out all the dust. Be sure to use a plastic tool to pop plastic snaps and clips. Use correctly sized screwdrivers(no wiggle) to avoid stripping screw heads. Don't over-tighten screws, they only need to be tight enough that they don't wiggle loose. READ the user manual, or better yet a service manual specific to the laptop model. Each laptop model offers a brand new disassembly/reassembly experience, and following the manufacturer's directions will help to avoid breaking something.    If you want something really durable, look for field laptops or military/law enforcement laptops which are often armored, and have a solid frame. Some even have their void spaces filled with foam for shock-resistance so they keep on working despite being dropped, tossed around, run over... shot, etc
Autodesk has listed their system requirements for each of their programs and versions their website: https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/learn-explore/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/System-requirements-for-AutoCAD.html  They also have some recommendations listed, which I would go with. Depending on how long you are planning on using this software or planning to upgrade it will make a difference whether to buy a laptop or desktop.  The big advantage of a desktop PC is, that you can add "better" or "newer" parts as soon as the current ones don't hold up anymore. This can become a problem with a laptop, when you either choose to upgrade the software or get larger projects, as it's more complicated to add new hardware to a laptop.

Soekris Net5501 fits the bill. Have a look at it. It has GPIO, 4 ethernet ports, serial port, SATA host, USB port.  Itâ€™s not tiny, but itâ€™s not uncomfortably big either.
If you are looking just for a PC without a monitor,speakers, keyboard...(considering you have those). Budget might go bit over the 270$ limit. This would be a perfect PC. You can also buy these parts used or new for less money since the pricing here is Amazon/Newegg-based. I figured you wouldn't need an OS(since everyone knows where to get it :D) and an optical drive.
I believe iClever IC-BK08 would do the job. Here is a review. It has a micro-USB port but there are adapters.
There is Serial to Bluetooth adapters, easily fond by using a search engine.  And with a Raspberry Pi, Max323 chip you can make a Serial to ethernet (WiFi or wire depending on Raspberry Pi version) device or just ssh into the Raspberry and run minicom from the console.
Mikrotik has various devices, for example mAP with suggested price $45. Wireless You can disable. You can power it via POE.
The ATEN CS1924 fits your requirements:   4-port DisplayPort KVMP Switch with USB 3.1 Gen1 hub and 2.1 surround sound audio Superior video quality â€“ 4K UHD (3840 x 2160 @ 60 Hz) and 4K DCI (4096 x 2160 @ 60 Hz) DisplayPort 1.2 compliant, HDCP compliant Supports HD audio through DisplayPort Full bass response for high-quality 2.1 channel surround sound systems DisplayPort Dualâ€“Mode technology (DP++) supports HDMI and DVI signals via a DisplayPort-to-HDMI/DVI DP++ adapter
I'd ideally like to handle rebooting multiple machines together so I don't have to wait 3 minutes to reboot one then the next, but if video magic or DDC/EDID emulation (or whatever's needed to do that) will add a lot to the cost, then it's not essential.  To achieve this, you should look into KVMs made by ATEN that have the Video DynaSync feature.  Video DynaSync was invented by ATEN, and they describe it in a white paper:     When the various computers wired to the KVM switch are booted up, they may or may not be able to detect the monitorâ€™s EDID; it depends on whether the    switch has connected a given computer to the userâ€™s monitor, and whether the DDC conveys the monitor EDID to the computer. [...] Some KVM switches offer a default EDID to the computers, but this default is just an arbitrary    monitor resolution. While an arbitrary EDID may allow switched computers to boot up as though they had read the actual monitor EDID, the chances are that theyâ€™ll boot with a less-than-optimum resolution. [...] In some cases the modern monitor may be unable to display anything when the user actually switches to them using an incorrect default EDID value, or the computer may    take a while to re-sync to the correct monitor resolution.      ATEN solves the switched EDID dilemma by adding specially configured EDID memory to its Video DynaSyncâ„¢-equipped KVM switches. When such a KVM switch is connected to an EDID-enabled monitor and turned on, the switch reads the monitorâ€™s EDID and stores it in non-volatile memory. This memory is made available at once to all the computers connected to the Video DynaSyncâ„¢ equipped KVM, and these computers are able to use DDC sensing to instantly read out the KVM switchâ€™s stored monitor EDID. [...] In the event the monitor is not turned or connected at the time the Video DynaSyncâ„¢ KVM switch is turned on, the switch directly connects the selected computer to the monitorâ€™s EDID so it is still able to get the needed EDID data. ATEN also provides a non-volatile memory to save the EDID that it detected the last time it was used so that, when powered up the next time, the chances are the KVM switch will already have the correct monitor EDID â€“ even if the monitor isnâ€™t yet powered up. Since a suitable EDID is always present for the computers, there is no â€œseekingâ€ time lost when switching among multiple computers, no blank screen, and no need to reboot computers just to get them to detect the optimum video value. Itâ€™s as though the computers each had a direct, full-time DDC connection to the userâ€™s monitor EDID information.    You can also find some IOGEAR KVMs that have the Video Dynasync feature, since ATEN owns IOGEAR.  Here are a couple KVMs that match your requirements, and can be had for under $100 (which is a lot less than Â£250):  ATEN CS84U   4-Port PS/2-USB VGA KVM Switch Superior video quality - 2048 x 1536; DDC2B Video DynaSyncâ„¢ - Exclusive ATEN technology eliminates bootup display problems and optimizes resolution when switching between ports Console mouse port emulation/bypass feature supports most mouse drivers and multifunction mice Complete keyboard emulation for error-free booting   IOGEAR GCS1724   4-Port VGA KVM Video resolution: 2048x1536; DDC2B USB or PS/2 mouse and keyboard peripherals Video DynaSyncâ„¢ optimizes display resolution and eliminates boot-up display problems Console mouse port emulation/bypass feature supports most mouse drivers and multifunction mice Complete keyboard emulation for error-free booting
Go for the 1080. I normally stick to the Power/Costs chart on https://www.computerbase.de/thema/grafikkarte/rangliste/ (for Germany) and normally it's a linear slope until a certain point, where you get less power for much more money, since they make their flagships more expensive for the high-end user. But at the moment, probably because of crypto-mining, even the cheaper models are more expensive, so that it's more or less a linear behaviour over the full chart. So at the moment, sticking to the 1080 would be more beneficial. However, in future I would go back to that chart and buy the most powerful graphics card, which is still on the linear slope of that chart.
I found that LG has recently released a 22" (21.5" Diagonal) UltraFineâ„¢ 4K IPS LED Monitor that has a resolution of 4096 x 2304.
You're in luck, ThinkPad 25 is going to have 7 row keyboard layout https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/lenovos-25th-anniversary-thinkpad-brings-back-the-keyboard-we-love/
You don't want to break an E1 (or T1) into individual lines because you will loose the ability to negotiate speed above 33.6k. Make sure the device you get handles analog connections.  USR gear did not play fast with other brands (mainly rockwell). Look at the following names in addition to Ascend Max  Cisco 5200 series  Portmaster Paton 2960
Chromecast would fit the description. I've gotten them for my non-technical parents and they use it all the time. It's inexpensive and easy to 'cast' webpages or videos, etc from a phone/tablet to the device.  I personally built a HTPC/NAS device. But that's a little overkill for most needs
I've been using this BenQ GW2765HT  monitor for awhile now and love it. It's a 27 inch 1440p display that's at the sweet spot of size and resolution and price (at the moment).  They have a 24" model that I'd assume is just as capable in the smaller size BenQ GW2480
Your power supply is plenty. It can supply up to 1200 watts and your whole system will definitely not pull more than that, even with two graphics cards. Nvidia recommendation for GTX 1080 Ti is 600W PSU for the whole system, when using 1 card. You can also check that with some online calculators, for example this one: http://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/  As for PCI Express lanes, I wouldn't worry about the lack of x16 lanes. Your CPU has 28 lanes, which means one of the cards will be running at 16x and other one at 8x (due to PCI Express specification), if you do not have any other devices that take up PCI Express lanes. Benchmarks and tests have been done by many tech reviewers/magazines, a GPU running at 8x will not decrease your performance in any noticeable way (up to 1-2 FPS).
You can use KVM over IP for that purpose. You just need to connect your PC and your desk with ethernet cable. It's not so cheap and has some limitations for screen resolution, but maybe it can solve your problem. You can find examples of this devices here.  Here is another wireless option Wireless Extender for HDMI.
A quick search using The Google for "HDMI over ethernet" resulted in many entries. One of them is relatively low priced, US$15.99 and has 30 meter distance capability. I note that the device requires a pair of ethernet cables, perhaps due to the volume of data being transmitted for real-time video.    Note that the search returned many entries and your search may provide more suitable devices than this one item.
Sierra Wireless MC7455 (mPCIe) or EM7455 (m.2)  This devices can also change the USB PID if you run into whitelist issues. Just lookup which USB PID is supported and change it with an AT-command.
You may have a slight misunderstanding of the equipment. Without seeing specific model information, this is an educated guess, but likely correct. The Verizon equipment is a cable modem/router combination if there is coaxial input and RJ-45 connectors for equipment.  The signals from the provider are transported on RF (television/radio type) signals, received by the modem/router and converted to data, then sent to the RJ-45 via internal router.  Any "converter" you find will be a cable modem, with or without the router portion.   If the existing modem/router has four RJ-45 ports, you can connect your "good one" to one of those ports and make use of its features.
MoCA WAN Bridge  Assuming your friend is using Verizon FiOS, the "modem" you're talking about is an Optical Network Terminal (ONT), and it connects to the Verizon router via MoCA WAN (not to be confused with MoCA LAN). There's a good summary here about the various router configurations.  What you're describing sounds most like option 10 on that page, so you would need a single MoCA WAN bridge like the D-Link DXN-221. This reviewer indicated they were able to replace their Verizon FiOS router with this device.  Most MoCA adapters are LAN only and won't work for the WAN connection from the router to the ONT.  Since a MoCA WAN bridge is so expensive/hard to find, I recommend you stick with fred_dot_u's suggestion and just use the Verizon router as the bridge to the router.
Kyocera's "Dura" line of phones and Casio's "G'zOne" line   frequently ~$100 new and ~$20 used. Waterproof and "military grade" specifications for impact resistance and dust resistance. Easily go for a whole week on a single charge. Easy to find these unlocked; not sure how Australia's mobile network works, but I think any GSM phone will work.
You could also consider custom-molded in-ears. As theyâ€™re precisely fitted for your ears alone, not only they block out noise more effectively, they can also be extremely comfortable.  If youâ€™re okay with deep insertion in-ears, you could check out the Etymotic ER4 as well. Or, consider foam eartips for your earphones.
There is a software and a hardware solution.   Symless is an affordable solution. And works more consistently than the free options out there.   You could rig up a USB splitter, but that could be too finicky to recommend without testing.
If you don't mind it not being android the AEG M1220 is Â£11.95 and I think it has 4G. For android phones you're looking at about Â£50 and they don't even have 4G. If it's for projects look for older phones with broken screens/buttons on eBay as they'll likely be much cheaper since they cannot be used well as a phone.

A Network Attached Storage (NAS) is something you may be interested in. There are several plug and play products available from companies such as Synology, Western Digital, etc. As well, there are a couple options for DIY'ers such as Freenas, Unraid, etc.  I have a Freenas machine that I built running in our home that I am able to access over the network, through any of our devices as well as remotely. As well, I've set up the computers in our home to back up to this NAS often. This is made up of spare computer hardware that I had laying around, that I've been slowly upgrading and replacing. I chose to house it in an Antec P100 case (plenty of hard drive trays, quiet, and plenty of fan / cooler mounting options).  The requirements for a machine to run Freenas is pretty reasonable. Looking at Freenas's website:        Multicore 64-bit processor (Intel strongly recommended)   8GB Boot Drive (USB Flash Drive suffices)    8GB   At least 1 direct attached disk (Hardware RAID strongly discouraged)   One physical network port      I've ran both Intel and AMD Freenas machines and honestly haven't noticed a difference (I'm sure there is, but as a user, I haven't seen a difference in my tasks). It is encouraged to use hard drives rated for NAS (WD Red, Seagate Ironwolf, etc.) as the manufacture warranty's for such use. I've used spare hard drives that I've had laying around for my personal machines and haven't had issues so far. I am in the process of saving up for WD Red drives to replace my current set of drives.  There may be better options that are out there, but for me and my use-cases, Freenas has been perfect.
Black Box has a 5-Port Gigabit Ethernet Switch with support for Power of Ethernet, however it does cost a pretty penny. Which is closer to what you probably want, with the exception of the power outlet sharing the same side as the 4 port out (but hey, at least it's not on the side!).
You should be thinking long-term here.  In your cirumstances it's generally better to put your money into a new motherboard/CPU first (video card abilities evolve much faster than motherboard slots change).  But YMMV. There's a "trap" if you replace the video card first: When you get around to replacing the motherboard you could end up wanting to (or have to) upgrade the video card at the same time.  Not to mention that buying the video card first prevents you from profiting from any video card advances (or price decreases) in the meantime.
I'd upgrade the CPU and mainboard.  If you were doing workstation graphics work, the i5-2500's onboard graphics would be a substantial downgrade from your Quadro.  But the same optimizations that make the Quadro a powerful workstation card make it a poor choice for a gaming card -- even though the HD 2000 has fewer compute cores and shares its RAM with the system, it'll be faster for games than the Quadro.
This post provides a list.  I don't know how accurate it is or up-to-date, its dated May, so...

Just connect router B's WAN(Internet) port to any free port on router A. Enable DHCP service on router B so it can provide addresses to the machines connecting to it. Machines can also use static addresses if preferred.  With this configuration, computers on router B can get to the Internet transparently through router A. No configuration regarding A is required on them.  The computers on B can see each other since they are on the same network segment. But they cannot see the computers on router A at all. Nor can the computers on A see the ones on B.
Assuming your network B has a different, wired WAN that is occasionally offline, I'm recommending the Pepwave Surf Soho MK3. It's available for $199 (not including shipping) on 3G Store, with the stock external antennae, and the same price on Amazon, with free shipping, if you want to buy your own.  The range is claimed to be 250-300â€™ through walls, though this is likely to be the 2.4 GHz band. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find any sources specifying range for the 5 GHz band. If the range is insufficient you may need to use higher gain or directional antennae, or provision additional access points.  Officially, the number of recommended users is 25, but if few users use any bandwidth, it is unlikely there will be a problem, as most issues arising from too many users come due to bandwidth contention. Overall, the Pepwave Surf is an excellent Wifi-as-WAN device, and likely one of the best single AP networking device for your purposes.
1. YES  2. I would recommend 1080p for 24" simply because you will get way more frames per second, and again more PPI, looks better and in this case 1440p with 24" is about 121PPI and 1440p with 27" is about 109PPI so really not much of a difference. Also I think I saw couple of 27" monitors and 2560x1440 at 27" is the same pixel density as 1920x1080 at 24"  3. It is and for 90% of upcoming games in next 3 years it will be, but then again don't hold my word, we can't predict future tough I reckon you will be able to play them in medium-high settings(in 3 years)  The monitors I would recommend are Dell S2417DG and Asus PG248Q tough I prefer Dell over Asus
I think this would be great(I included a monitor too since you didn't specify if you needed it), but I didn't include the storage since I don't know do you need 1TB or 5TB, you didn't specify it. Price without the monitor is ~1500$ which is ~1270 euros. You can take the nVidia 1080 if you are doing much complex work in DaVinciResolve but the 1070 should do the job.
If it's 8350K vs 7600K, I would go for the 8350K, as it is slightly cheaper and a little better performing.  Even 8100 vs 7400 shows the same scenario.
If your AC adapter is 200W, your situation is similar to mine. I have a 120W laptop and 230W gaming laptop, and here are the solutions that I found.  1) ChargeTech 54000 mAh       at $399 - Top-of-the-line solution that will power any device up to 250W. Still the price is quite steep.... This uses a mains AC output, and so I'm unsure about how it works for an Australian output, but the specs say "The international outlets are compatible with Type A, B, C, I, G, E, and L."  2) Aviant 42000 mAh at $220  - Cheaper solution than the above. It worked for my 230W device. The specs say that this supports 200W continuous/250W peak, and so you should be OK. This also uses a mains AC output, and so I am unsure about Australian compatibility.   Devices such as the MAXOAK 50000 mAH WILL NOT WORK! The specs only support up to 90W, but I was able to get my 120W laptop to run. My 230W gaming laptop did not run.   I did a detailed write-up of my testing if you're interested.

Main uses would be   Linux OS Programming (C++) Virtual machines   while your requirements are   reliability price   Assuming you want an internal SSD,  I would say that you would in theory want an SSD with SLC, however, they are more expensive.  For example a search on newegg.com for SLC in the range $100-200 resulted in 1 match   WD Green M.2 2280 240GB Internal SSD ($147.96) disclaimer I do not use newegg but that was the only international product comparison search I knew that has "power search".   In practice, given your intended use, a MLC based SSD should suffice. A search for MLC in the same range resulted in numerous products. The linked Wikipedia article even states that     In February 2016, a study was published that showed little difference in practice between the reliability of SLC and MLC.   (referencing Bianca Schroeder and Arif Merchant (February 22, 2016). "Flash Reliability in Production: The Expected and the Unexpected". Conference on File and Storage Technologies. Usenix. Retrieved November 3, 2016.)   You also need to ensure that the SSD you purchase support     ... the ATA_TRIM command for sustained long-term performance and wear-leveling.    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Solid_State_Drives.   The only thing that I am aware of when using SSD with Linux is to ensure that the file system you use for the SSD supports TRIM. See the referenced archlinux link on SSD.  Given your intended use I would say any SSD with SATA revision 3.0 ("SATA 3" or "SATA III") interface should perform well enough.     You could say the maximum for SATA revision 3.0 is 6Gb/s, and that the maximum for SATA revision 3.2 is 16Gb/s.    https://superuser.com/questions/807226/sata-3-theoretical-speed   I personally run an external SSD with USB 3.0 (can transfer data at up to 5 Gbit/s that is 625 MB/s according to Wikipedia) from where amongst other things I run virtual machines (Windows 7, Linux). For your stated uses I doubt you will have any performance issues.  If you want to narrow down your search (MLC) in an effort to improve performance then I would recommend considering an SSD with NVMe interface if your motherboard supports it. The same search on newegg adding "PCI-Express 3.0 x4" narrows the search down to about 20.  I recommend searching for reviews or comparison videos for more specific examples. My favorite is NVMe SSD Review - Which Should You Buy? - 2017 Edition. Notice what he says in the beginning of the review; NVMe is for high-end machines; for mid-range computer see his "SATA SSD" review.  Good luck!  PS  Reading Digital Boffon's comment I remembered that I forgot to mention something about read-write operations -- which would have basically been the same tl;dr as the answer Boffon referenced     Yes, there's a limit, but you needn't worry about it. You simply won't be able to perform enough read/write operations before you run out of capacity.   My source however was "The SSD Endurance Experiment: They're all dead This is the end, beautiful friend" by Geoff Gasior â€” 10:22 AM on March 12, 2015.
I answered a similar question here and I think this would be great for apps you are using. I didn't include the OS and an HDD/SSD since you didn't really specify. You can also reduce the price by purchasing a cheaper PC Case.
The question What exactly is the cause of RAM incompatibility? on superuser provides a good overview of possible causes for incompatibility. The answers to the question provide some interesting reasoning.  https://superuser.com/a/1252224/774206     You might have two RAM sticks with the same part number and one can tolerate a 5% undervoltage and the other can't, and the mobo might put out a low voltage because it's poorly calibrated.   But, again, this is very rare now. Sane combinations almost always work.   Before DDR2, it was a mess. After DDR2, it was sufficiently standardized.   In the follow up discussion https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/65926/discussion-between-david-schwartz-and-ehryk     These days, it's almost always the obvious incompatibilities. That is, if it doesn't work, you can usually figure out why. When you can't, the most likely explanation is that some part is just crappy.      In the old days, weird incompatibilities were not that unusual. But since the DDR2 standard, cases of incompatibility not involving one of the explanations mentioned are fairly rare. Most of those cases are likely to be components that are not quite meeting their specifications.   From another answer https://superuser.com/a/1252995/774206     I built many systems throughout my career and I have not once looked at the supported RAM list before I chose the components. And I have never had any incompatibilities so far. That being said, the list can give guidance to beginners and less experienced people to select the correct components to build a good working system.   From another answer https://superuser.com/a/1252617/774206     The answer lies within the memory controller. The memory controller used to be on the north-bridge of the motherboard. It had to negotiate all the features that the CPU supported for direct memory access. So the CPU is really the determining factor that limited what memory you could use even though it appeared to be a motherboard capability. This is more obvious now that the memory controller lives inside the CPU in all modern chips made by Intel, AMD, and ARM. The motherboard firmware contains microcode from the CPU manufacturer that dictates what kind of features for direct memory access it supports. So the software still lives in the motherboard but the hardware is in the CPU now.      The clocking of CPU and Memory are directly linked through the Base Clock. They have to be multiples of each other in sync. Aside from that the details of Direct Memory Access are non-trivial and I will not attempt to explain here. My understanding is that just like MB and CPU manufacturers have different implementations and features, so do different memory modules. Within one memory manufacturer, like Kingston, the actual chips could be made by Samsung, Hynix, or someone else. They should all follow a spec but maybe they don't implement every feature the same way.   While no answer was accepted, one was given the "bounty"; https://superuser.com/a/1252970/774206. The answer provides some examples of what may cause incompatibility.   Using the   (Could not find the specification for INNODISK) Samsung datasheet 288pin Unbuffered DIMM  based on 8Gb B-die SK hynix DDR4 SDRAM Unbuffered DIMM Based on 8Gb M-die   I have tried to create a comparison table. Mainly for the fun of it :)  My best [uninformed] guess is that with the new CPUs, motherboards and memories the main criteria for memory compatibility is the common referred specifications, and any incompatibility issue is mainly due to "bad luck".              +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+             |      INNODISK      |      SK HYNIX      |      SAMSUNG     |             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+             | M4CR-AGS1MC0G-BE93 | HMA82GU7MFR8N-TFT0 | M391A2K43BB1-CPB |             |                    |   (revision 1.2)   |                  |             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+     chipset |  K4A8G085WB-BCPB   |  H5AN8G8NMFR-TFC   |K4A8G085WB-BCPBM00|             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+    bandwith |     2133 MT/s      |      2133 MT/s     |     2133 MT/s    |             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+   frequency |    (1066.67MHz)    |    (1066.67MHz)    |      1066MHz     |             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+     voltage |        1.2         |         1.2        |        1.2       |             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+        rank |       Rank 2       |       Rank 2       |       Rank 2     |             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+     density |       16GB         |     16GB (2Rx8)    |    16GB (2Gx72)  |             |                    |1Gx8(H5AN8G8NMFR)*18|1Gx8(K4A8G085WB-BC##)*18|             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+     timings |====================+====================+==================|             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+  cycle time |       0.93ns       |       0.93ns       |       0.93ns     |             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+    tCK(min) |                    |       0.937        |       0.938      |             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+          CL |         15         |         15         |        15        |             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+   tRCD(min) |                    |    14.06 (13.50)   |     15 (14.06)   |             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+    tRP(min) |                    |    14.06 (13.50)   |     15 (14.06)   |             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+   tRAS(min) |                    |         33         |         33       |             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+    tRC(min) |                    |    47.06 (46.50)   |       47.06      |             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+         CMD |                    |                    |                  |             +--------------------+--------------------+------------------+   Update  I purchased the M391A2K43BB1-CPB and installed it; the computer boots without any errors, and no errors are reported after test:   running MemTest86 (v7.4) 4 to 5 passes (~12h), running stressapptest (v1.0.8) stressapptest -W -s 3600.
That card will work, but it's a UHS-II card and the Wii does not support UHS-II, so it can't use the high speeds offered by this card. In fact, the Wii is old enough that even UHS-I cards can't run at their full speed. You'd be overpaying for technology that the console can't use.  I'd probably suggest something like this SanDisk Ultra card. They're generally reliable and are decent performers even in devices that don't have UHS support.  Wikipedia has more information on SD card speeds.
Those 2 monitors are pretty quality products but I can recommend you a few more. If you want to buy a 24-25" monitor for both gaming and programming, you may think   ASUS PB238Q (23") Acer R240HY bidx (23.8") HP Pavilion 22cwa (21.5")   All of them have very thin bezels and cheaper then 250 Euros. If you tell me about your gaming setup, I can recommend a few more. You may check this guide for choosing a programming monitor.
There is WiGig. You need a compatible wireless adapter and a dock. There are some wireless adapters for laptops that support it from Intel and a few docks from Lenovo, Dell, etc. If your desktop has a compatible port for an adapter (M.2 with PCIe) then you're good to go.
Have a look at this: https://store.open-electronics.org/index.php?route=offers/salescombopge&page_id=6  Its from a quick Google search.  A plus of going with a Pi is having ModemManager (software for controlling modems). Ive seen a working SMS manager connected to ModemManager written in around a hundred lines of Python. Or if you have access to a regex library its fairly simple to write AT command software yourself.  Going with Arduino or other MCU-based solutions is also a way, but the major budget element is the GSM board itself. And MCUs are way more limited.  If you go with a Pi3 you should be able to power it with a single 5V (havent checked exactly), remember to get at least a 3 amperes one. Thats slightly above 15W power at maximum draw.  edit  Havent looked through your question that carefully, Im too focused on embedded stuff and havent noticed a USB modem is an option. Get some cheap modem, but dont bother with all that usb mode switch stuff manually in my opinion. ModemManager is good enough for that. Or that shield with SIM900 - it uses UART.  As for screen output - thats nonsense IMO, unless you work with the kernel. You can launch a GDB session iver ssh or telnet. Or do any kind of stuff via ssh actually.  Also if you get a decent modem (like the USB one you posted) the Pi has WiFi and it should be possible to configure it as a router.  edit2 Blame me... Seen this in the feed and didnt check the question date.
Google's giving me something close-ish as a first hit ("ethernet KVM switch" was what I used):  switch - https://www.amazon.com/TRENDnet-8-Port-CAT5-Switch-TK-CAT508/dp/B00I3GKLP2 USB cables(same as from the switch page) - https://www.amazon.com/TRENDnet-8-Port-CAT5-Switch-TK-CAT508/dp/B00I3GKJEK     Manage servers over CAT5 cables for distances up to 30 m       8 Ethernet ports to connect to servers       Dual Console support Supports both USB and PS/2 connections    There's probably more, and probably something rack-mount to boot, but that's 8 ports already.
PCPartPicker estimates your build at around 750 watts with two video cards installed.  Power supplies tend to be most efficient when loaded to about 25%-75% of capacity, so you're looking at something in the 1000W-1200W range.  I'd recommend the SeaSonic PRIME Platinum in either 1000W ($210) or 1200W ($250) capacity: 1000W if the computer is going to be spending most of its time nearly idle while you do design work, or the 1200W if it's going to be running all-out for hours on end rendering.  I haven't used this particular power supply, but I've had good experience with SeaSonic power supplies in the past, and they've got a reputation for quality.  It's a high-efficiency power supply (rated 80+ Platinum, 90% efficient or above across almost the entire working range), and it's got the four 8-pin PCIe power connectors you need for your graphics cards (actually, it's got eight of them).
How much power do you need?  If you upgrade to a second 1080Ti you will need about 250W*2+150W of power supply, plus peripherals, plus enough to catch any power usage spikes and to compensate for the sub-100% efficiency and the efficiency degradation over the years. So 1000W is a realistic estimate for this (and a comfortably conservative one).  So what is the recommendation?  The EVGA SuperNOVA 1000-G3, it is an ATX form factor 1000W Gold-rated PSU with 8x 8-pin connectors for graphics cards (you will need 2 or 4 of these).  So what are the differences between Titanium, Platinum and Gold PSUs?  The difference between the various certifications are efficiencies. A Titanium rated PSU needs to hit 94% efficiency, a platinum 92% and a gold one 90%, so as you see there isn't that much of a difference. However, as you have such a large buffer with regards to power, going with a gold-rated one will do.  Additionally EVGA is extremely confident in the quality of this PSU, which is why they give a decade of warranty on it, so I wouldn't worry about build quality (and besides EVGA has an excellent reputation with power supplies).  If you want to read more about PSUs, have a look at this article (about this PSU) and the references it links. And also note that Mark's suggestion will also be fine (and a little more efficient / with a little longer warranty for a bit more money).
So I shall estimate that 500GB is enough for Windows, your tools (Blender + other installed programs) and the current project. To store these 500GB to which you would want quick access, I recommend the Samsung 960 Pro 500GB for 290USD. Why this SSD?   It is the fastest somewhat affordable SSD, meaning you will get GB/s transfer rates from it, which will make even large projects load instantly. It is a Samsung Pro series SSD, meaning it is meant to survive more write operations (which will probably happen) Samsung is a very reputable brand when it comes to SSD and this one is covered by a 400TBW / 5yr warranty, meaning if you write less than 220GB per day on average on your SSD, it will last you for at least five years, if not much longer, speaking for its build quality.   Now of course 500GB won't cut it if you want to archive old projects. So after you are done with your current project you'll have to move the data to your WD Black 4TB HDD for 186USD. On this drive you have essentially 4000GB of storage available, which should be plenty for a couple of old projects. But what does the "Black" mean? It's the WD series of HDDs "for gamers" featuring technology that is supposed to make the HDD faster, however the really nice side-effect of this is that these technologies treat the mechanical disks inside nicer meaning the HDD will last longer than an average HDD (and WD also gives a 5yr warranty). For further reading I recommend this guide on WD drives.
It turns out that finding 4x8GB of DDR4 RAM with 2666 transfer speed for 300USD or less is impossible. However, I barely found this RAM, the G.Skill Ripjaws 4 2400 32GB for 300USD.   It is compatible with the board and CPU listed (which both easily support this RAM speed) It is within the appointed budget of 300USD. Reviews of higher-clocked variants appear to look good for this series of RAM Being 4x 8GB it can make use of the 4 memory channels of the Threadripper With 15 cycles of delay, it's not the lowest-latency RAM but it should easily do the job
No common OS expects data on a disk to change by itself. Such a device wouldn't be considered a disk and couldn't be used just as one. It'd have horrible performance, wouldn't be safe (OS access controls can't be enforced) and wouldn't be cheap.  Try defining your use case and asking what hardware/software could do it. You may get better possibilities this way.
You can more easily solve your problem if you divide it in 2 devices. Get any common projector that solves your presentation needs, but with an HDMI input.  With that get an Intel compute stick or a raspberry pi with Wi-Fi, put your OS on that and get remmina running from the network.
They are all various ways of referring to the same process, which a Xerox engineer invented (hence the name of their company): Xerography.  HowStuffWorks has a decent overview of the process here.  So, to directly answer your question, they all use the same printing technology.
I'll like to go with Intel i7 8700k. Intel processors are more developer friendly. Supports more Advanced technologies like    VT-x Turbo boost Intel Optane   Intel supports more development technologies than AMD. And you will not see the performance difference regardless of processor you choose. You should use the latest SSD. Install the OS and Visual Studio on SSD. That will increase your IDE response time a lot.
You could connect the drive to something like a raspberry pi zero and set it up as a media server. The RPi controls the drive and runs a media server allowing other devices to access it remotely even, for example, being able to use the drive as a remote drive on the other devices.
It looks like you should be looking more at e-readers than phones/tablets.   Something like this perhaps? https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Professional-cheap-13-3-Boox-Max_60538385575.html?spm=a2700.7724857.main07.10.75b367af4LveAr&s=p
I have done hierarchical prefix delegation using the AVM Fritz!Box routers.
I recommend a HP printer, specifically the HP LaserJet Pro M130nw. Amazon claims to sell it for $99 once you add to cart.  HP has always had the best support on Linux [1][2][3], and the current open source drivers &ndash; which are in the default Ubuntu repository (main),* and may even be installed by default^ &ndash; claim full support for the M130 series [4]. Linux is also listed as a compatible OS on the specs page  It has 802.11 b/g/n as well as 100Base-T Ethernet (and USB 2.0,of course). Print output is 600 dpi maximum, with "FastRes" pixel doubling. Scanning is 600 dpi Colour, 1200 dpi Mono. Unfortunately, there is no autofeeder for the scanner. If you want one, you'll have to pony up for the next higher model. Auto duplex, single pass scanning and colour printing are all at far higher price points  Recommended page volume is 150 to 1500 pre month for both Print and Scan, though maximum duty cycle is 10&thinsp;000 pages per month.   Its minimum dimensions are 398&thinsp;Ã—&thinsp;288&thinsp;Ã—&thinsp;231&thinsp;mm, minimum being when all trays are closed, etc.    *"main" means a Canonical maintained package. It likely has the best support.  ^if it isn't, just sudo apt install hplip in a terminal or search for it in Synaptic or Software Centre. apt has a nice progress bar.  Also, I'm assuming that laser Mono is preferred over inkjet colour. There may be a relatively affordable inkjet multifunction that also fit the requirements.
You can go for either matte surface or anti-glare ones.  The rough matte surface panels are still mostly used in the business notebook segment. The other type of anti-glare computer screens, which uses a chemical coating over a smooth surface to cut down glare, is more used on glare panels to minimize the amount of glare there.  Anti-glare surfaces have a smooth surface but reduced reflection. Matte has a rough surface and no reflection.
I have the same setup, except with a GTX 970. I use a cheap-o VGA kvm and it works great.    This HDMI KVM is what your are looking for. Sea Wit HDMI KVM Switch - 2 Port KVM Switcher Supports 1080P 4Kx2K     The setup is very easy, have one cable from your GPU plug into HDMI 1, and another from your laptop plug into HDMI 2... Then what ever monitor you want to use to switch between desktop/laptop... plug that monitor into HDMI out. Then simply plug in your mouse/keyboard into the KVM.     I keep my laptop on the left side of my desk, so I use my left monitor and leave the other 2 connected to the desktop. I kept my KVM on my desk for a while, but realized that I just hit scroll lock 2 times and windows would automatically switch the kvm for me, so now its tucked behind the desk.    Let me know if you have any other questions, I'm sure there are cheaper options out there... but this one has good reviews, even if their marketing seems a bit hyped.
For the time being, until I hear a better solution, I came up with a workaround... I am using TeamViewer to get on my laptop and do work there. One monitor is feed from laptop, while the other 2 are from desktop. If I need to copy things over, I can easily achieve that as TeamViewer lets you copy text. Images I can do via shared drive or directly access the drive from desktop to laptop. Furthermore, I have setup to have access to my websites on laptop from my desktop via browser. Now I can hit a page on desktop and debug on laptop.  I Posted this to let you all know what my workaround is at the moment so anyone who may like this may use it.
First of all, impression as if stored on their own desktop is not something you will be able to get, unless files are very small. Accessing files via network is, of course, noticeably slower. Not much, but just noticeably. Though iSCSI sometimes does an awesome job at caching locally (SMB not so).  Second, a simple SATA hard disk (with nothing special) is almost certainly entirely sufficient. Not only will the server perform caching in RAM, but also the harddisk is not the bottleneck. 10 workers is not much of a challenge to even a small NAS intended for home use, unless what they call "work" is something like transcoding video streams. 10 people working, that means maybe two or three dozen disk accesses per minute, at most. What about it?  On a GbE network, you can get around 110-115 MB/s throughput, not more (well, twice that, if your switch as well as your computers support link aggregation). A single harddisk can deliver that. Easily. While this sounds good, remember that you will not always have large contiguous reads. In fact, most of the time you don't. Access time over network is, well, let's say not that great. So, whether or not the actual disk is somewhat slower or faster makes not that much of a difference.  We're using both SMB shares and iSCSI on Synology over GbE here (with link aggregation support), and the disk is by no means the limiting factor. I've tried every setup from a single disk to 4-disk RAID-0 (as well as every other RAID level that makes sense), and the real, observable difference is exactly zero.  I haven't tried SSD, but I am very confident that the difference would be zero, too.  To give you an idea about how much latency can matter (not raw troughput), if you compare a task that is prone to access time such as for example indexing a 12GB movie in Avidemux (lots of small reads), I get about 300 frames per second indexed over SMB, about 650 over iSCSI, about 20,000 and 25,000-27,000 on SATA-SSD and nvme-SSD, respectively (both Samsung 950s). With the movie being in the buffer cache, I get 33,000-34,000. That's network versus local, and bus versus no bus.
Thinking about this what you are wanting is what amounts to a one way chat application. Someone is typing into a chat window and what they type is displayed on the LED displays.  What the LED display will display will depend on the software driving the display so the crucial detail would seem to be the need to have a computing device that supports UTF-8 and Unicode with fonts with the necessary symbol set for the language desired.  There are a number of open source chat type systems such as described in 5 open source alternatives to Slack for team chat. The question would be what support any of these have for non-Western languages such as Mandarin or Arabic. Languages such as Mandarin and Japanese have a large symbol set and Arabic is written right to left rather than left to right and there are various kinds of ligatures between symbols.  Or I suppose you could just have a remote session to a full screen word processing application and just type into that and let it scroll up and off the screen? That actually might be the easiest approach as the necessary multi-lingual capabilities should be available and you can change the font size easily.  I would consider using a Raspberry Pi 3 or similar small device to drive the LED displays. The Raspberry Pi has several alternative operating systems with Raspbian, a Linux variant, being the standard default. The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B has built in WiFi, 1 GB of RAM, and an HDMI display output. You could set up a device such as a laptop or even a phone and remote into the Raspberry Pi.
I consulted Reddit's MechanicalKeyboards forum recently, and the consensus for the best cheap mechanical keyboard appears to be the Magicforce 68. Although it's a 60% percent board, as opposed to the larger board you linked, and its 'blue' switches aren't Cherry, you still might find this recommendation useful.  Personally, and on the more expensive side, I've been very happy with Das Keyboard (Model S) which is just above your max cost but has a lot of bang for the buck in my mind.
With DD-WRT, anything is possible! Try a live demo here. Note that the demo is outdated and many features have been disabled on it.  DD-WRT is a custom firmware available for a variety of routers that adds many additional features such as supporting multiple different wireless networks connected to different vlans, hosting a VPN server, and much, much more! There are other solutions such as Tomato, OpenWRT, and LEDE, but I haven't used those and I know for a fact that DD-WRT does what you're asking.  Simply take a router that works with DD-WRT (compatibility can be checked here, see [] for a list of current recommended routers) and flash DD-WRT onto it (A general installation guide is available here, google for a router-specific guide as each router is slightly different.)  Warning! incorrect installation of DD-WRT can Brick your router, so be careful and follow a router-specific installation guide.  With your fresh DD-WRT head to 192.168.1.1. There you will be prompted to set the web interface's login info. Do so and head to the Wireless->Basic Settings submenu. Here you can edit the default SSIDs and add more under the "Virtual Interfaces" list.  You use different VLANs for separate networks, but I'm not familiar enough with networking to tell you how to do that.
They're both GTX 1070 graphics cards with 8 GB of GDDR5 running at 8.008 GT/s on a 256-bit bus.  They both use two cooling fans with similar heatsink setups, require one 8-pin PCIe power connection, and have the same five output connectors.  In short, they're virtually identical cards for an identical price of $439.99.  If you're looking for a reason to pick one over the other, the EVGA card is clocked 0.7% faster than the Gigabyte.  It's also half an inch shorter and three-quarters of an inch narrower, making for a better fit in a crowded case.  The true power draw isn't specified, but the faster clock speed probably corresponds to an increase of 1.5%.
As operating a professional data recovery service, I would not a advise using a NAS (see below why).  My golden rule is "KISS" : Keep It Simple, Stupid.   Use preferably professional-grade hard drives (with 5 years warranty) if you can afford them. You can buy them second hand if you want to reduce costs, but format them fully and afterwards check the SMART values with a software like HDSentinel or HDTune. Don't put all eggs in the same basket.  If something goes wrong with one drive, you can go on working on other projets whilst the data recovery is being done by a data recovery company. If you have a tower PC, use one (or more) hot swap bays to make inserting/removing hard drives easy. For instance: http://www.icydock.com/goods.php?id=141 Huge benefit : you'll have SATA speeds when doing your backups. Much faster than USB 3. On Windows, the HotSwap! utility will be the perfect companion of the hot swap bay: http://mt-naka.com/hotswap/index_enu.htm For regular backups, use a file synchronizer, like FreeFileSync for instance, which will make your life easier: https://www.freefilesync.org/. Preferably don't use such tool on your long term backups to limit the risk of human mistakes. Don't forget that drives that are not spinning for a long time can catch some kind of rhumatism (platters oxidation, a.s.o.) Make multiple copies. Preferably use backup hard drives from different brands.  So, if one brand or serie is subjet to a particular failure (eg. firmware bug) you will have more peace in mind that other drives that are not affected by it. Store your backups in one or preferably more locations that is away from the your office, in order to limit the risks of loosing all your data (burglary, fire, water damage). Store the drives in a cool and dry room and use an air dryer (dessicant) for that room. Additionnally, you can use anti-moisture/anti-ESD bags with a small dessicant bag in them (silica gel or equivalent). Some bags have more foils than others and make a better moisture barrier.   Why I would not advise a NAS:  NAS often use RAID systems, and RAID 5 is frequent amongst systems using three drives or more. When things go wrong, it can be pretty difficult (and long) to recover data from RAID 5. And I can ensure you that things go sometimes wrong with RAID 5 arrays. For instance, problems can become visible after more that one drive have failed. Any serious data recovery company will have identify which drives(s) is/are defficient and this can take time as a full scan of each drive may be necessary in some case. Most of the time, defective drives will have to be cloned to healthy ones before a data recovery can occurs. NAS systems are mini-computers, with a tiny operating system. When problems like bad sectors affect the operating system, the OS may fail to start. Reassemblying stripes from RAID 5 systems is not obvious, as several parameters will have to be "guessed" (width of stripes, order of disks, offset, a.s.o.) with the help of softwares and often using an hexadecimal editor. All this requires hand and brain work and time. Waiting days or weeks can be painful for any company.  To all these drawbacks, one should mention that to spare on license costs, most NAS use systems based on the Linux kernel and many use the ext3 file system. The nature of the ext3 file system makes a data recovery more difficult, also in case of accidental file deletion, especially as one cannot reconstruct the folder tree and have the files keep their name like with NTFS.  If you however want a NAS take it RAID 1 (= full redundancy).
I finally found a product that does what I want, the OBi200.  It's $50, and it's not a phone, you still need to buy a home phone separately and plug it into it.  But you don't need to get a paid VOIP or SIP service at all.  All you need is Google Voice, which is free.  This solution allows you to make and receive unlimited domestic calls within the US for free.  (EDIT: You can also use it if youâ€™re outside the US and want to make free calls to the US.)  Note that the set up is pretty straightforward, but one problem I ran into is that I couldn't receive calls at first. It turns out way to solve that problem is to go into Google Voice settings, and under "Forward calls to", select "Google Chat".
The Alienware 17 R3 and R4 run on Intel Core i7-6700HQ or i7-7820HK.  These CPUs run the socket FCBGA1440. Thus it cannot be upgraded, especially not with a desktop-grade CPU.   The Pin-count (1440) miss-matches those of the desktop CPUs (1151, 2011). The CPU is physically soldered onto the board, it cannot be easily removed and even if you would succeed, you'd be back to the first point and these CPUs are just about the most beefy CPUs there are for this socket / power class.
The biggest advantage for a laptop is portability, other than that it has no major upsides especially in the 3D world, and at your budget.  The most important difference is desktops are upgrade able and 99% of laptops are not.  Need a faster GPU make sure your power supply can handle it, your case can fit it, and then buy any GPU upgrade.  Just buy a desktop(Full Tower) than can fit a 12" long video card(and standard power supply 750w ) and you can plug anything into it.  A laptop has a fixed heat and power budget, and even if you could swap out the GPU you the extra heat and electrical current could burn out circuits.  I have seen a few laptops with swap-able graphics, but at prices over $4000 USD.  3D work requires a higher end GPU, and the bigger the project the more GPU you need.  Being able to upgrade as you go is a definite advantage.  https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883152294 Get a 17" screen to go with it.  However, you have a different currency, and etc so I have no idea what your price would be.
It sounds like the best drive for your circumstances is a 3TB Western Digital Green.  Normally, I'd never recommend a WD Green because of severe performance issues (the firmware prioritizes power savings over speed of access).  However, since you're using the drive for backups rather than as your main drive, the delays probably won't be an issue.  Reliability-wise, the WD Green uses the same hardware as the rest of Western Digital's drives.  It's only the firmware that differs.  The drive is $88 from Newegg, which should translate into a UK price within your Â£50 budget.
You mentioned ZenBooks. There is a SKU with an 8th gen i5 and an anti-glare screen.  ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH55  Also the Dell XPS 13 9360 has such a configuration option. See here http://www.microcenter.com/product/487760/xps_13_9360_133_laptop_computer_-_silver. As well as the Lenovo 720 https://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/yoga/700-series/Yoga-720-13/p/88YG7000827  Something not from the big brands is the Sager NP3132, pretty expansive but a lot of configuration options.
I would recommend buying an express card with the esata port. This will allow for much higher data transfer speed over your FireWire or usb options.  Newer esata runs at speeds of around 6gb/s so you will probably get the speeds you need with that. You can find express cards with the esata option for around $20-$30. If your looking for speeds in excess of 6gb you will need to upgrade to use usb 3.1.
Here is an option for you as there are really lots of options when it comes down to wireless cards. The TP-Link AC1300 WiFi PCI-Express Wireless Network Card (Archer T6E) is available through amazon for around $50.    The card has been tested with several versions of Linux and others have reported success using Linux Ubuntu.   There are several models available I just listed the 1300 but they have a 900 which is smaller and still pci-e so that might fit your case better. Not sure what your network router is setup for so I would only use what your router speed is set and not pay more for what you can't even use.
I recommend the Thinkpad X230, avalible on Amazon refurbished for â‚¬&thinsp;273.71. It has an i5 3320M, 8 GB of RAM and 320 GB of hard disk space.  While the N3060 is a relatively recent processor with a respectable boost clock speed, it is based off the Braswell architecture, part of Intel's low power Atom designs. That means despite the apparently high clock speed, the performance of the CPU is quite low, perhaps achieving half to a quarter of the performance of even the older quad cores, such as the i5 3320M. While it is a snappy processor for things like light web browsing, it will definitely feel the strain and start to lag once you start editing photos.  The 8 GB of RAM is another significant advantage, even on Linux, and especially if you plan to use the more resource intensive Windows (to which it comes with a licence for) at all. With 4 GB of RAM, basic multitasking can be difficult, and as a beginner programmer myself, I can't tell you how helpful it is to have a few tabs of Stackoverflow or MDN open in the background. While 4 GB might be sufficient if you shepherd your RAM carefully, many times, your OS will start to venture into swap, again increasing lagginess.  Overall, the ThinkPads generally have better build quality than the IdeaPads, as they are the premium lineup. The X series especially, along with the T and W series, are the highest quality, professional grade laptops.
Many monitors have VESA type mounting brackets which allows the use of a standard VESA holder. There are a wide variety of these from wall mount to rack mount to stands which can be attached to a table.  The first thing you need to determine is whether your monitors have a VESA mounting bracket or not. Not all monitors do. It sounds like you are planning to buy an additional monitor so one of the requirements should be that the monitor has a VESA bracket on its back.  The actual mounting gear will depend on whether the monitor has a VESA standard mounting bracket and the weight and size of the display. You will also need to consider how to route the cabling for power and the display signal.  For instance see the results from this Google search: https://www.google.com/search?q=vesa+wall+mount&rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS755US755&oq=vesa+wall+mount&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3149j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
You didnâ€™t specify if you planned to buy a standard ATX motherboard or a smaller one (micro-ATX, mini-ITX)?  The renowned French tech site Hardware.fr provided a spreadsheet with all AM4 motherboards characteristics. It includes the audio chipset reference. URL is https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10dvMrPxjWqo5E3VO9djvjC5DU4vXXVtlXRoZsJBesc0/htmlview The higher the number after "Realtek AlC" is, the better the chipset is supposed to be (see Realtek website for tech specs).  However I donâ€™t know if higher-end Realtek ALC chipsets will make a difference in your audio setup. When I bought myself a Ryzen platform I knew I needed a SPDIF optical output, and I wondered if such an option means the manufacturer taked extra care on the audio part. Last but not least, marketing says that insulating the audio area from the other  motherboard component provides better audio quality.
I had determined that the Samsung HM1000 was causing BSOD crashes about once per week, but after resetting the PC (for other reasons), it hasn't caused a crash once.  So, at the moment, I declare the Samsung HM1000 as the only headset I've found that works well with Windows.
It's not a board from a traditional server-focused manufacturer, but the Asus X99-WS/IPMI appears to meet your requirements:   Single LGA 2011v3 socket supporting Xeon E5-16xx CPUs (you may need a BIOS update before you can boot from a Xeon v4, though). 8 RAM slots supporting up to 128 GB of unbuffered DDR4 2133 ECC RAM (and since Asus is a gaming-focused company, you can probably use DDR4 2400 ECC, even if it's not officially supported). Five PCIe mechanically x16 slots with a mix of x8 and x16 electrical connections. IPMI 2.0 support.   You'll need that cheap video card, though, as it doesn't have onboard graphics.
HIS 5450 Silence 512MB DDR3 PCI DVI/HDMI/VGA,  Make sure you get the PCI version because the also make a PCI-e version. But good luck finding one.
Here is a reasonable setup:    What is a price efficient parallel number crunching server?   If you buy the parts from Amazon, you can assemble for $8600. When we bought from Supermicro reseller (3 years ago), it was $15K.  For building bigger machines, I recommend sites like:   http://www.titancomputers.com/Titan-Simulation-and-Visualization-Computers-s/706.htm   Here you can check what hardware components match each other, customize then buy, or assemble from Amazon (then you have to do the dirty work of assembling and installing OS).
You're not going to do that much better just due to updated models of hardware.  For instance, current RAM will probably be 2400 rather than 2133, and current Xeon/Epyc chips will offer more banks (6-8 per socket, which only helps if your code is memory-bandwidth limited.)  The latest Xeons support AVX-512, which could double performance if your linear algebra is big enough, vectorizable, and you're linking with something like MKL.  I see you mention 64 threads - have you actually measured whether HT is benefiting you?  It does only if a single thread can't keep the pipeline busy (and if you're spending all your time deep in a well-tuned LAPACK kernel, that's not the case...)  OTOH, if your code is really all about slamming big matrices around, have you turned on hugepage support?  From the huge memory footprint, it doesn't necessarily sound like GPUs will be a good fit (to be efficient, they need a lot of work to do on relatively small memory).
I'd recommend an Ivy Bridge or Sandy Bridge E3 Xeon, such as the E3 1245. These CPUs are more or less lower clocked i7 chips, and have excellent performance. They will, on average, have a performance between a stock i5 and i7. As shown in these benchmarks, this means that at 1080p, you will easily lock 60 FPS for the latter two games. It is very likely you will be able to  achieve a minimum of 60 FPS for the near future (ignoring GPU), except on very CPU heavy games like Assasin's Creed.  As to which Xeon to pick specifically, obviously, the bigger the number, the better. Note that the 1220 and 1225 series do not feature hyperthreading, and you may as well buy the equivalent i5. If you can find an equivalent i7 at under your budget, that would also be an option. Ivy Bridge (v2 or 3xxx) CPUs are more or less equivalent to a Sandy Bridge CPU clocked ~ 100 - 200 MHz faster.  These CPUs require a LGA 1155 motherboard. Check the manufacturer's webpage for compatibility if purchasing a Ivy Bridge CPU.  Honourable mentions  Newer platform, similar performance: The Ryzen 3 1200 is just under your budget for $99.99 at Amazon.com. At stock, it's about the same performance as a higher end IB Xeon but you do get access to some modern bells and whistles on the newer platform. It has an average overclock of 3.9 GHz, which may give a decent boost to performance. On the other hand, the newer platform has higher costs associated with the RAM and others. The Ryzen CPUs use a AM4 socket.  The new Coffee Lake i3s are just out of your price range, but may also be worth considering. The old AMD FX series on the other hand, while a decent amount cheaper, $75 for a "6 core" and $90 for 8 &ndash; and have attractive looking clock speeds &ndash; are definitely to be avoided, as they have significantly lower performance due to low IPC.
Although a bit buggy, Asus Transformer Mini T102HA is a considerable option.  I've been using this for 3-4 months, and my primary concern is the lack of apps, and the palm rejection has some issues very rarely.  However, if you're OK with using OneNote, this device can give you pretty good experience.
It most likely doesn't have an M.2 interface so SATA is the only option I guess.   You are correct here.     Is there any (performance) difference between SATA and mSATA or is it just a different form factor?    mSATA is a standard used to map SATA signals onto a PCI-E mini card connector, in order to run hard drives from a PCI-E connection.  Source  I would not advise trying to force your machine to boost with this method, it adds needless complication according to the threads you linked.     Is there any (performance) difference between SATA and mSATA or is it just a different form factor?   Just a different form factor. It can still only use SATA data transfer protocol, so your throughput limitations are the same between form factors. The big difference from my understanding is where you plug it in.     I don't need SSD faster than motherboard's bus can transfer   This won't be an issue for you, your bottleneck for data transfer bandwidth doesn't occur here. Since you can't take advantage of the higher-speed PCI-E slot to connect your system boot drive (no M.2 support), you're going to be throttled by the SATA connection limitations anyhow. Don't worry, you'll still get plenty of speed improvement in real-world use.     Considering all the facts I think the best is to buy some SATA III SSD like Samsung 850 Pro (little above 500 MB/s read and write). Am I right?   Samsung has been at the top of the SSD market for a few years. The 850 Pro is about as good as it gets for a 2.5 inch SATA 3.0 drive. I use one in my build and it works great.  If you're shopping around, offerings from Crucial and Kingston can offer competitive real world performance for most workloads at a moderately lower price point. That being said, if you're looking for the best drive on the block that fits your specifications then it's hard to not recommend the Samsung 850 Pro.
There's many options, but a few that I would recommend over the others.  If you don't mind some DIY and have a nice wired mouse laying around, then this is the best option. This github is not too hard to install (my opinion, it might depend) and provides quite a lot of backwards compatibility. As long as you have 32-bit or 64-bit Office and Windows 2000/Excel 2000 or later, this option will work reliably.  Another option is to get a mouse with a trackball. They are, in my experience, pretty comfortable once you get used to them. Also, there's a pretty wide spectrum. My friend uses a MX Ergo (link here) and has never complained. The battery lasts quite a while and the bluetooth "Unifying" receiver works really well.   Finally, if you don't mind any mouse as long as it has horizontal scrolling, just try a couple of the following. They all have horizontal scrolling, but I can't vouch for the reliability: 1, 2, 3, and 4 all should work but I don't know for sure. It's probably best to do a bit of research if you don't like any of the options.
I bought an ultra-book Asus UX410UQ-GV068T for coding and graphism.  Spec:   CPU: Intel Core i7 7500U 2.7Ghz GPU: Geforce GTX 400MX 2GB Vram SCREEN: 14" Led screen Full Hd DATA: SSD 128go + HDD 500go RAM: 8Go DDR4 2133mhz (+ i added 8go - 123â‚¬) MORE: 1x Usb3, 2x Usb2, Hdmi port   Beautiful design (silver), comfortable screen (it's a 13" case with a 14" screen with thin border) and beautiful color, backlit keyboard, battery 8 hours, large touchpad, ergonomic and pro.   Photoshop, Illustrator, Brackets and tons of tabs on chrome with music at the same time and the computer works like a charm. Linux compatible (useful with 2 Disks). CUDA 9. I even succeed to play Battlefield 1 on it (with good framerate on mid/low settings).  Personnaly, i searched for a long and didn't found the half for 1069â‚¬ (sales price).    If you want a notebook, something more powerful and not so expensive, you should look for Gigabyte laptops or Msi laptops, there are both specialized in laptops for gaming.
Maybe your current hardware is still enough? Would be nice if you could list it, programs like speccy and HWinfo can list your stuff if you do not know. Target (or native display) resolution , budget and and current games you would like to play are of help for you and us to help you.  The remark concerning the 1600x is spot on.  To answer your question I will take a look at Intels current similar priced counterpart to the 1600x(6C,12T): The core i5 8400(6C, 6T). The CPU has no SMT so no additional 6 threads like the 1600x which means that demanding programs which need a lot of threads will run slightly slower on the 8400 but Intels gaming performance is slightly ahead. The CPUs are roughly equal but that depends on your settings and programs.  4K gaming the performance is similar, lower resolutions result in 10% - 20% advantage in fps for the Intel and 10% better frame times. Demanding stuff with lots of threads will run 10% faster on the AMD, maybe more, maybe less. The Intel CPU has also a slightly lower power consumption in most if not all possible scenarios, maybe 5W - 10W difference idle to medium loads and up to 20W in peak loads. Comparison without any overclocking on either side. You can flip a coin, let your software decide or - most importantly - look if your CPU is available since here in Germany right now the 8xxx Intels are hard to get or overpriced. Data for the performance is from a German PC site: https://www.computerbase.de/2017-10/intel-coffee-lake-8700k-8400-8350k-8100-test/5/  Additional info: The Ryzen is slightly cooler thx to soldered and not glued heatsink, the 1600 non x should have a decent reworked cooler which allows decent overclocking to save some bucks, Ryzen can be used with cheaper mainboards for like 75$ since only 3xx chipset socket 1151 boards work with Intels 8xxx CPUs right now which cost at least 100$, cheaper boards are rumoured to come 'soon'.
I think you should try the Razer Blade Pro 4K gaming laptop it is perfect for development. It uses the 7th generation core i7 CPU. It has 2.9GHz speed, with a 3.9GHz Turbo and 4.3GHz over-clock potential. It has Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU with 8GB of VRAM.
After doing some more hunting with weird search terms, I have found a solution in the Amazon Marketplace:  https://www.amazon.com/NGFF-PCIe-Adapter-Samsung-SM951/dp/B01MS64UBB  US$ 34.95 .. a bit expensive for a board with virtually nothing to it, but oh well.  This is the correct non-SATA adapter card, if all it has is the M.2 slot with no chips on the board.
A Google search for Redshift Vray takes me here: https://www.cgdirector.com/best-hardware-for-gpu-rendering-in-octane-redshift-vray/  Quote:  To use Octane and Redshift you will need a GPU that has CUDA-Cores, meaning you will need a NVIDIA GPU. VRAY-RT additionally supports openCL meaning you could use an AMD card here.  The best bang-for-the-buck NVIDIA cards are 1070 GTX (1920 Cuda Cores, 8GB VRAM), 1080 GTX (2560 Cuda Cores, 8GB VRAM) and the 1080 Ti (3584 Cuda Cores, 11GB VRAM).  ,  As a "mobile workstation", the ideal choice is going to be something expensive with dual GPUs, typically referred to as SLI.  If you are serious about high GPU performance, you will go with a heavy luggable beast of a gaming laptop with two full-size desktop 1080 GTX or TI GPUs crammed into it, rather than the low power mobile (xxxM) versions.  This will likely cost you more than US$2500 for the laptop, and it won't be a small sleek device, but huge, thick, and heavy, with large air vents all across the back.  There are many examples to choose from, just do a search of your favorite web commerce site for laptop GTX 1080 SLI.
I have no specific brand to recommend, but I have a comment on laptop component failure..  One of the main causes of laptop death is the eventual failure of the video cable that passes from the lower case body into the upper lid.  In most laptops this is a tiny cable approximately 1-2mm in diameter with about 20 individual hair-sized conductors crammed inside it, that passes through the middle of one of the hinges.  Every time you open or close the lid, you axially twist these conductors, and after twisting and untwisting about 300-500 times they are going break. The screen will now intermittently flicker on and off as the broken wires occasionally touch or separate.  If you want long life for a laptop, you will seek out this replacement video hinge cable when the laptop is new and buy about four of them for future use, to be installed every 3 years or so, when the cable wears out and the tiny wires break.  ,  Getting ahold of this cable as a spare part may be rather difficult, as it may not be available unless you directly contact an authorized warranty repair center that can obtain these repair parts direct from the manufacturer.  I have tried in the past to do this with some of the higher end gaming laptops as these have potential future lifespans measured in decades, and the failure to be able to buy video hinge cable spares ended my interest in that gaming laptop brand.  When the laptop is 4+ years old and out of production you will definitely not find this part new anywhere because it is custom for every laptop and there is no generic-fit replacement. But perhaps you might find it used, with some 200 flexes already in it, and a short remaining life ahead.  ,  There is an exception to this which I saw in the IBM Thinkpad z60M laptop, where instead of the tiny hairlike hidden-hinge cable, IBM instead used a flat flexible yellow-orange ribbon cable about 3 cm wide, from the body to the lid.  This ribbon cable is exceptionally durable, and the laptops reached 10+ years of age with none of the display ribbon cables ever failing to my knowledge.  I do not know if this flat orange ribbon video cable design has been carried forward to any of the Lenovo brand Thinkpads.
The GPUs, contrary the CPUs, are already massively parallel devices. On the CPUs, running a program simultanously on multiple ones, requires to make it parallel, which can be a significant re-factoring (and sometimes it is even impossible). On the GPUs, this problem doesn't exist: they already have a lot of internal processing units working parallel.  However, the chips still have manufacturing constraints. This is improving quickly (see Moore's Law), but as we can see, there are always a newest game which requires yet another VGA card invention. :-)  A single GPU can handle multiple displays, it is not a problem for that since a long time. Similarly, as a CPU can run multiple programs at once.  I can't see the reason, why would it needed to have multiple GPUs for the different displays.  However, if there is the manufacturing limit, then it can be feasible. You have to compare, which is better for you:   Having a single, probably costlier GPU, handling both of the displays Handling the multiple displays with different GPUs   (1) may be too costly, or if your requirements are strong, this chip may be even not existing.
Probably none.  You're most likely using MST - in a very unusual fashion, similar to how 5k monitors, and the old IBM T220 did. Your graphics  card likely is aware that its "one monitor with very high refresh rates, and I need to render it as seperate tiles", and I somehow suspect its rendering as 4x1080px120hz 'tiles'  I'm unaware of MST even working on multiple video cards.  In practice, 4k60 gaming on a single video card is tough - so you'd want to take advantage of SLI/Crossfire or the DX12 multigpu options anyway, which still don't need you to plug in the monitor into different cards.   So for regular use, I'm doubtful multiple cards are better than one card capable of presumably handling 2 or more 4k60 monitors. For gaming, you will likely need a eyewateringly powerful setup.
If you are building a PC, choosing a PSU is quite simple.   Most people do not give importance to find the right PSU. But, I personally consider PSU to be a very vital part of a computer. I myself build my first PC recently and I will share with you how I chose the right PSU.    Wattage: The parts that you included has their own power(wattage) requirement. There are other parts of a computer that might require the power from the PSU. So, you got to make of list of all the items in your build - Processor, CPU cooler, Memory, GPU, Case fans, HDD/SDD and any other part that does not have a separate power source. To make the wattage calculation easier, I would suggest that you use this free tool.  I would also recommend that you consider about the possibility of adding newer parts and/or upgrading certain items.   My build required around 300 watts of power. However, I chose a 500 watts PSU. This is because, I might include few parts in future and my power requirement might go up to 400 watts.  Modular: This is another major filter. Check this link to know the basic difference between non-modular, semi-modular and fully modular PSUs.    Non-modular PSUs are cheap but all the cables pre installed(which you cannot remove). Choosing this means you need to work harder on cable management so as to keep good ventilation to your case. If you have a case with a lot of free space, you can go for it. Research about your case to know better.   Then comes semi-modular and fully modular PSUs with limited cables and no cables pre-attached to them. Fully modular is the highest priced.   I had the NZXT S340 elite case. This has lot of space for cable management. So, I chose a non-modular PSU.  Efficiency: PSUs are rated like any other devices.  80 Plus certified PSUs are energy efficient than the ones that are non certified.     This table will help you with the basic difference between the 80 Plus PSUs.   Some brand try to mislead the consumers by not mentioning the correct 80 Plus details. I would not recommend going for a 80 Plus PSU with no medal attached to it.   I chose a 80 Plus Bronze as it was under my budget and because it suited my limited hours of PC usage.     Form Factor: This depends on your case. If you case supports ATX form factor, choose a ATX PSU and similarly for other form factors. Research about your case to find the right form factor.   I used PC Part Picker  to check for the compatibility of the various parts of my build.    One last thing, I highly recommend choosing a PSU that is meant to be sold in your country/region. This is to avoid any issues with the regulations posed for electric/electronic items.  Though I am not an expert, I think I have covered the basics here. Feel free to correct me if I am wrong and/or lacking information.
TL;DR: A used board that supports VT-d if you can find one and are willing to buy used. If not, whatever board is cheapest here and meets your I/O requirements (currently an ASRock H81M-HDS R2.0 looks like the best option.)  I'm assuming you've checked and your board is out of warranty and that RMAing it isn't an option. If not, I'd recommend you go that route (though from anecdotal experience, Gigabyte is particularly poor with RMAs.)  First, let's take a look at the various chipsets for the LGA 1150 socket.    You'll notice that as we go down the list, the boards essentially get better.   Straight away, we can ignore some things: since you've got a Haswell CPU with no plans to upgrade, we don't care about having a _97 series board for compatibility purposes. Again, since you have no M.2 devices with no plans to upgrade, we can ignore the _97 series on that front.  Since your CPU doesn't support overclocking, and you have no plans to upgrade, getting a Z series board is unnecessary for overclocking. As such, no motherboard will offer a performance boost, assuming it supports your RAM speed, whichâ€“based on the tier of the rest of the systemâ€“I'm assuming isn't particularly high, and is likely supported by all motherboards.  After that, the main difference is mostly I/O. Your requirements are quite low, and any board at all will fit these requirements (at least 2 SATA 3 ports and one RAM slot.) You mentioned "max 6 USB ports", but didn't clarify if you needed USB 3 on those ports, nor how many were provided by the case. I'll assume for now that 2 USB 3 ports, 4 USB 2 ports, and one USB 2 header is enough, which puts almost any motherboard on the list. I'm also going to assume you want an HDMI port on the motherboard, and that you'd prefer not to get a (relatively inexpensive) passive DVI to HDMI adapter. You also mentioned wireless keyboard/mouse, but since your current board doesn't have built-in Bluetooth, I'll assume you already have some solution.  However, your CPU does support one interesting technology: VT-d. Basically, it allows you to directly pass through I/O devices (like GPUs) to virtual machines with no* performance degradation. Though it's not for everyone, as a developer, this can be quite useful. Though Wikipedia lists only Q87 boards as supporting VT-d, this is incorrect. For example, the ASRock H87M Pro4 supports VT-d, as does the B85 Pro4. However, so far, I've been unable to find an H81 board that supports VT-d.  LGA 1150 boards are new enough that there's enough stock lying around that getting a new board won't cost you too much extra while providing you with a warranty and other nice benefits... if you're willing to use a Micro ATX H81 board. This prevents you from using VT-d, and will limit both your I/O and expansion options. Buying other boards new is significantly more costly, with the cheapest not-H81 board currently being a ECS B85H3-M at $63.32 (though it appears to lack VT-d, defeating the main point of getting such a board), followed by the Biostar TB85 (again, also apparently lacking VT-d), and the Asus B85M-G R2.0 at $96.59, well above what the used market is at (roughly $40), while having poor to mediocre I/O selection.  Of course, buying used comes with its downsides. If you want the best value, it will also take some searchingâ€“Craigslist and eBay auctions can be a significant hassle (I couldn't find any eBay Buy It Now offers that fit your requirements and were decent value.) If you're not comfortable with that, I'd suggest saving the money and just getting a cheap H81 board, unless you have an immediate use case for VT-d. Those used boards will still be around.  As always, make sure your case will fit the board too!
Monitors are pretty standardized for plug-and-play use.  Just make sure that the resolution is compatible with your computer (i.e. not too low and not too high).  I would recommend buying one used, to save some money, but make sure that the seller includes a money-back guarantee and preferably has some kind of certification for refurbishment (i.e. don't buy it at a yardsale unless you trust the seller).  Well-established sellers such as Amazon.com, BestBuy.com, Walmart.com, and Staples.com are usually trustworthy to purchase refurbished monitors from.  If possible, I would recommend a clicks-to-bricks store so you can easily return it in person at a local store if there are any problems (shipping a monitor back might be difficult I think).  I actually just bought a nice 22-inch 1680*1050 monitor yesterday at my local computer shop for an amazing US$24.50.  They had smaller monitors selling for as low as US$7.00!  They are a Microsoft-certified refurbisher and all the monitors come with a 90-day guarantee.  https://www.techreup.com/
Here's what it sounds to me like it boils down to.  You could buy a graphics card and power supply. One benefit of that is that, if you decide to replace your computer down the line, you can move the graphics card over and not have to pay for one again for a while. Installing a graphics card is very straightforward. Installing the power supply is pretty much straightforward, but it's a little more of a pain. I'd say that $30 is very reasonable to have someone else do this for you.  You could also buy a new computer. Here, you'd be getting the benefits of the latest hardware. Also, depending on the games you're wanting to play, integrated graphics have gotten good and you might be able to avoid buying a graphics card for a while longer.  Here's what I'd suggest. Since you haven't done any of this before, I'd take the specs of your current machine and your list of parts down to the computer store and ask their advice. I'd give it 100% chance they're only too happy to talk it over with you and give you tips as well. If, based on their feedback, the project seems like too much cost or effort, go with the new machine. (And consider buying it from them!)  Final point: I haven't looked much into your parts list but my gut feeling is that a 500W power supply is too small. I know graphics cards have gotten better but, when you're picking a power supply, you want to look at the power requirements for all your components (so basically, 250W from your current machine and 300W for the graphics card, leaving you at 550W) and then pick a power supply for which your power requirement is at 80% of the maximum rating of the supply. So you probably want a power supply that is rated for 650-700W.
Look at the Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition.  Also found Onda V80 has it running.
Here is a good one, except that it has no Blu-Ray:  Acer Aspire E5-575-539R   It has a core i5 7200 (only 2 cores but 4 threads) 8GB RAM Memory card reader (SD) 1TB HDD And (not sure it will suit you) DVD writer optical writer Windows 10 (But there is no antivirus)   Have a look at this link:  https://www.scorptec.com.au/product/Notebooks/Notebooks/67448-NX.GE6SA.017-C77  You can see full specs. It is for $729 (AUD) about 560 USD
For maximum performance: 2x AMD 16-core Opteron 6300-series "Abu Dhabi" CPUs in an eATX board. Work down from this point according to your price point.  AMD started shipping CPUs with the TMP starting with Jaguar. AMD added support for hardware AES with Bulldozer. Because we need ECC support, we want to look at AMD's server CPUs. This gives us the following architectures on the following platforms:   Opteron 3200-series "Zurich" (32 nm) and Opteron 3300-series "Delhi" (32 nm) on Socket AM3+   4x2.4 GHz to 8x3.6 GHz  Opteron 4200-series "Valencia" (32 nm) and Opteron 4300-series "Seoul" (32 nm) on Socket C32   4x2.2 GHz to 8x3.4 GHz  Opteron 6200-series "Interlagos" (32 nm) and Opteron 6300-series "Abu Dhabi" (32 nm) on Socket G34   4x3.3 GHz to 16x2.8 GHz    A 32-core monster (if you really want to stay in ATX and not a weird form factor) at this second would cost you about $200 for the motherboard and $200 for the CPUs. However, because this is used server gear from several years ago (see: performance to power consumption ratio is not good), there's a good chance you can find something for a very low price, if you're willing to deal with the normal headaches of server-grade gear. Take this HP Proliant DL385 G7 with 2x Opteron 6174 2.2ghz 12 cores, 24GB RAM, and 2x146GB SAS drives for $300, for example. If you can find something on Craigslist, prices are likely to be even better.  As for performance? Why bother with 2x the performance when you could have over 4x?
It does not come with a cooler or thermal paste. Since the point of a K skew CPU is overclocking, you'll want a beefy cooler so you can push your CPU to the max.  Tom's Hardware ran benchmarks, and it's clear that the 8600K eats a massive amount of power, especially when overclocked.    I'd recommend a cooler with at least a 105W TDP. The Cryorig H7 is rated for 140W and costs only $30, but any cooler that can handle the heat should do.
You can obviously buy 2 USB bluetooth 4 le dongles.   Gets power and CPU from the computer Gets power from batteries, but you need some kind of CPU.   Designing your own and getting it produced will take a lot of effort and money to get a company to agree to produce said circuit.  From the needlessly overpowered but easy solution department.  The Raspberry PI 2 (add bluetooth dongle) or 3 (built-in bluetooth)   Hook up a BIG battery  Hook the keys in the typical 11x11 or 12x12 fashion to the GPIO pins Write some code to do the translations and connect using the standard built-in bluetooth tools. In python should be very simple. Under clock it to the max possible and disable as much as possible to increase a pitiful battery life to a usable one.
RAID 0 striping  useless no protection RAID 1 mirroring   qty 2  of 1TB gets you 1TB storage RAID 5 parity data   Requires 3 drives and give you the capacity of 2. RAID 6 parity data(x2)   Requires 4 drives and give you the capacity of 2   RAID 5 can handle 1 bad drive and 6 can handle 2.  Your budget means if you do RAID 5 you will spend your entire budget on hard drives.  Now what?  Well some versions of Windows has a software RAID 5 or 6, and linux offers similar including the ZFS and btrfs file systems.  Reading will not be significantly impacted by software RAID 5 or 6.  However, writing will take a big hit in terms of CPU utilization will spike every time you write to it.  If your CPU isn't fast enough your write speed will be limited.  You will also have less CPU to run your normal programs.  Hardware RAID solves this, but is completely out of your budget range.
I'd recommend the Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1. Dell sells this for $699, but if you also buy a BD writer, it becomes more like $850.  It features the Intel Core i5-8250U, a Kaby Lake R Quad Core. With a base frequency of 1.60 GHz (cTDP-up of 1.80 GHz at 25 W, 3.4 GHz boost), it likely has only marginally lower sustained performance (and almost equal peak) than the older max performance chips, such as the 6700HQ. Even though it's an i5, it has hyperthreading enabled.  This is the cheapest 2-in-1 I could find offering Windows 10 Pro preinstalled. There are other, cheaper laptops with similar hardware, but you may have to shell out $100-200 for a Windows 10 Pro licence.  As to your other requirements, unfortunately, there is no internal ODD, but the screen is 15.6", with a fairly standard 1080p IPS panel. The default configuration comes with 8 GB of RAM, 1 TB of HDD and a 802.11ac WiFi adapter with 2x2 MIMO.  There is no review of the current model, but Notebookcheck's review of the previous model, with the same sized battery, shows over 7 hours of battery life when idle, and 6:57 when simultating web browsing at a screen brightness of 150 nits. However, under heavy load, the battery life is under two hours. Please note that the tested model has slightly different hardware and may not be entirely representative, but it is likely that the current model will be close to that level.  It has a headphone jack and a 1 year subscription to McAfee, though it isn't preinstalled. Unfortunately, it does not appear to support Thunderbolt.
Consider this build:   Intel  8th gen i5 8600k G.Skill Ripjaws RAM. These ones can be from 4 to 16GB in each stick, but of course more costly. A motherboard that supports overclocking (z370 PRO4 for example) and has enough RAM slots,  GTX 1050  Most importantly, your CPU cooler must have high TDP( like the H7)  Also, your PSU I would say should be about 600w and rated 80+ Bronze or higher. But this will be a costy build.   These are the main parts. You can then get your own choice of case, monitor, peripherals, and LED's etc.  If you get those parts I mentioned into a custom build, then I think you should be good with any program for at least a few years. However, because you said you don't want to play games, you might consider a less powerful GPU of your choice. In any case, I wouldn't completely go without it, just get a cheaper one.
Update: Three different T-Mobile employees lied to me ("Any tablet that says 4G or LTE works"). After I got the tablet, I tried to use it with my sim card. It wouldn't work, so I called their support. They suddenly mention something about an IMEI number. I read the number off the device. They now tell me it won't work.  Now I have a cheap, low-powered Windows 10 tablet wasting away in my desk at work.  I suspect you can't get just any device you want with an always on connection, and I further suspect I'll have to get a "hotspot" if I want to use my data plan on a linux device.    I asked this question here because I felt it was very difficult to find exactly what I was looking for.   I was right.  Dead Ends  I used Google. I searched Amazon, ebay, newegg, T-mobile (my wireless provider), and even Google's shopping. Then I found a site called Frequency Check that would let me search by frequency.   Having been given 1700/2100 bands by a guy at T-Mobile, that's what I primarily searched for - but later I was told by multiple T-Mobile sources that anything with LTE or 4G would work.   Anyways, the models I was finding on Frequency Check were not showing up in my searches. It turned out that, when I could find them, they were only available on the foreign versions of sites. Out of desperation, I started to consider trying to make a purchase from a Chinese site using Google Translate.  The Holy Grail  After much searching and wondering what I was missing (since I knew the market for this could not have completely died in the USA), I finally decided to watch some CES videos on Youtube, and then I Googled "CES tablet" for a rundown, and finally found what seems to be an ideal 2 in 1 tablet, the Alcatel Plus 10.   This still seemed only available from non-US sources, at least directly from Alcatel's site. But then I found a new in box factory unlocked one on ebay.  Here's my original requirements lined up with my conclusion:   "T Mobile's data network (1700 and 2100 band?)" - The keyboard has LTE, and by some descriptions can provide connections for up to 15 other people. "easily rooted" - well, it comes with Windows 10 home, and it is unlocked, so while I won't get the experience of rooting an android tablet... I only have so much time... and I'll have administrator access on the device. "can run Linux or Android's linux" - Windows 10 home should provide me with a Linux subsystem, but I'm also entirely prepared to install straight Linux on it. "Bluetooth" - this was important because I wanted to get a clamshell keyboard, but I suppose I can do without it. However, I just checked the specs and it's supposed to be included. "a clamshell bluetooth keyboard accessory would be good, mouse even better" - well, I suppose I can get a bluetooth mouse now  "use it like a regular tablet to navigate when I get off the subway" - I do worry about this a bit, it's a little larger than my almost 8 inch tablet that I used to use to navigate, and google maps was an app only a few taps away, but the keyboard is supposed to include GPS - so I guess we'll see what happens. "use it like a laptop at meetups" based on the form-factor, I think I can stop lugging my larger Lenovo Yoga around in a backpack now, a major improvement for my lifestyle. "pipe video to a big screen from it when presenting or demoing code"  - It has HDMI mini, so I suppose I need a cable and/or an adapter. "utilize it as a mini screen to expand my laptop's desktop size when working at home" - Still not sure how I'll do this, but I still want to.   The hard part about this specific model is that I couldn't easily find a seller in the US.   But I scored - I managed to snag what was advertised as the last one on ebay, new in the box, unlocked, for ~$310 including a 2 year warranty (which I hope not to use, and didn't mind spending less than $30 for).  As I was prepared to spend as much just on a tablet and more for a clamshell laptop-y case (probably another $100) I think I have found a solution that doesn't cost an arm and a leg (another of my requests).    Sidenotes:   A possible competitor was the Asus Zenpad 10, also ~$300, with Android and an optional dockable keyboard (noted in the early promotional material) but I could not find the optional keyboard accessory for sale anywhere- which I would expect to be pricey anyways.  I am usually reticent to buy things as complex as computers or phones on ebay, but given the difficulty of my search and my inability to find a seller through other venues, I really had no choice.
MicroSD cards and flash drives have to fit within certain dimensions to fit into the slot.  Data densities are not high enough, especially with MicroSD as the length, width, and thickness are all dictated by standards.  USB sticks are not supposed to be wider or thicker than the standard USB port as not to block other ports.  Sure you could have one 3 feet long(to fit enough chips on), but that would be too prone to breakage and would never be produced. Rules of supply and demand.  Most 10tb+ hard drives are in the $320 price range and cost more than most want to pay.  Risk, they are too new to have proven reliability.  If they do break you lose all 10TB all at once, too many eggs in one basket. Most people who need large amount of storage buy cheap hard drives say 2tb, but buy 7 or 10 of them.  Then merge their storage in a RAID preferable 6 for maximum redundancy.  Then add hard drives as needed.  If you want decent write performance you will need a hardware RAID controller which is another $300-$800 unless you can find one on ebay or etc.   You could also suffer the tedious BLU-RAY.  https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827129075  At 50gb per disk means about 22 per TB with overhead.  However even 22 * 6TB= 132 blu-ray to manage.  Keep clean, normal temperatures, labeled and safe from harm is a lot of work.  Plus you would have to verify the backup every 6 months or so to make sure they aren't deteriorating over time.  I saw Quad Layered blu-ray listed at 128gb, but give the density they are probably even less reliable.
Ryzen series chips actually have the edge right now against Intel's offerings when dealing with multi-threaded workloads. Yes, they are great for gaming, but they're great for production as well.  Providing that budget and availability is not an issue, I firmly recommend the newer Ryzen series over the older FX series. Ryzen has significantly more speed and processing power compared to their equivalent product tiers in the FX series, and you'll be future proofing your machine to last longer before another upgrade / replacement cycle.
TL;DR: Ryzen, unless you plan on never, ever touching this computer after building it.  Let's take a quick look at the advantages/disadvantages:  Ryzen              |                 FX â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“|â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“ Performance        |      Performance/$ Platform           |      Platform cost Upgrade path       |   Performance  While I'm having some trouble understanding exactly what your workload is (terms like "virtualization" and "programming" encompass a wide range of things) and how much processing power that requires, you've indicated that your FX-6300 was adequate for these tasks.  Based on the tasks you've listed, it seems that most of the applications you're running are either multithreaded or simply don't require that much processing power. As such, we can take a look at the multi-threaded benchmarks for the FX 6300 in comparison to Ryzen to get an idea of processing power:  CPU                | Passmark         | Passmark/$ â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“|â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“|â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“ FX-6300            | 6370             | 92.33 FX-8350            | 8946             | 81.33 Ryzen 3 1200       | 6784             | 61.81 Ryzen 3 1300X      | 7376             | 57.19 Ryzen 5 1400       | 8447             | 54.50   Even the lowest of the low for Ryzen should be more than enough for your workload by this metric. It is worth noting that the entry level Ryzens (1200 and 1300X) do not have SMT; if you plan on running a workload that requires more than 4 cores (e.g. a host OS and >3 VMs), you should probably consider getting a better CPU. Ryzen offers these quite easily though.  Performance/$  Because of the availability of FX series CPUsâ€“even new stillâ€“FX still takes the cake for performance/$.  Platform  The AM3+ platform is terribly old, and lacks many features, some of which would even be considered "standard" today: SATA 3, USB-C/3.1, and (gasp) RGB. At the same time, AM3+ only supports 22-38 PCI-e 2.0 lanes (depending on chipset), whereas AM4 24-32 PCI-e 3.0 lanes (depending on chipset.) AM3+ also lacks M.2.  Platform cost  Because of the availability of (especially used) hardware, AM3+ is still a slightly cheaper platform than AM4. With that said, the difference is relatively small. The real value comes in memory: DDR3 prices are fine now, while DDR4 is stupid high (roughly double the cost) due to DRAM shortages.  Purchase new  While FX CPUs are still available new in large quantities, the availability of AM3+ motherboards has dropped heavily. If you want an AM3+ motherboard, you'll either have to pay too much or buy used.  Upgrade path  The FX platform really has no upgrade path to speak ofâ€“once you get the FX-8350, it's not really worth the money to go anything higher Meanwhile, on the Ryzen platform you can just keep going up to a Ryzen 7 1800Xâ€“over 2x the power of a Ryzen 3 1200.  Intel?  No. For multithreaded workloads, Ryzen currently has the $/performance on the medium-low end.
The SilverStone DS380B has 8 hot-swappable bays plus 4 fixed ones. Fair enough?
About your software questions, as commented, they belong on different sites.  To your question. If you are willing to pay you can certainly find a lot of laptop options that have 32 GB RAM.  One example is this HP Envy 15t, that has a 7th gen i7, 32 GB of RAM, a 512 SSD drive + a 1 TB HDD, and a 4K display.
There are motherboards that have three digital video outs. For example, the Asus Z97-A has one DisplayPort, HDMI, DVI, and VGA connector, and supports three displays simultaneously.  Alternatively, you could get a graphics card that has three digital outs. Something as cheap as an HD 5750 should fulfill the requirement without requiring any extra power from your PSU. I'd recommend just browsing eBay looking for something in the Radeon HD 5000-7000 series or GeForce 400-700 series.  One final option: you could use an MST hub on an enabled DisplayPort port/GPU/OS to split a single DisplayPort signal into multiple DisplayPort outs and connect each to a given monitor, but because of the high cost of this method, I won't detail it.
You can buy a cheap external videcard with 1 digital Out and then using it together with your integrated motherboard's video. But previously you need to check that your motherboard's BIOS supports this function - you can find extra information there . It works well in Windows 10. I used this way in other case: my external card has only digital outputs, but I need to plug third monitor with VGA input only.
TL;DR: Get an R510 instead of a case. If you already own a motherboard or need to buy new, get an RPC-4116 (if you need to buy new or prefer a cleaner solution) or a DAS and an LSI 9200-8e.  Finding an enclosure with 10+ hot-swap bays is incredibly easyâ€“just take a look at Newegg's server chassis page.    Right away though, you'll notice the first issue: price. As a general rule of thumb, server chassis are far more expensive than their "consumer counterparts", even accounting for the fact that many include PSUs.  There's a second, less obvious issue: how are the drives connected to the motherboard? Almost all of these cases use a SAS backplane, not a bunch a  of individual SATA connectionsâ€“something a standard motherboard won't be able to connect without a special controller.  This seems to leave four options:  1. Buy a cheap chassis and the appropriate card  Norco has a solid reputation, so the RPC-4116 seems to make sense. I'm less familiar with HBA cards, but the IBM M1015/LSI 9211-8i is popular and cheap.  2. Buy a chassis that uses a SATA backplane  Sadly I couldn't find one, I'll edit this if I find one.  3. Buy a complete server (used?)  Given the high cost of buying a chassis and bringing your own hardware, unless you seriously value flexibility or have your own hardware already, buying a complete server could be seriously worth it.  The Dell PowerEdge R540 supports up to 12 x 3.5" hotswap bays barebones at  $1,848.99.   As does the ProLiant DL380 G10 barebones at $2,259.99.   However, both of these are rather expensive options given that used server hardware is available much, much cheaper while allowing for cheaper memory and CPUs.  The R510 can support the same with barebones starting around $50.   Or the DL180 G6 starting around $75 (though they have a reputation for being extremely noisy without a fan mod, and as such, I'd recommend the R510 over it.)   If you do decide to go the used route, I'd recommend using LabGopher to search for a good deal.  4. Buy a DAS and connect it to another computer  Another option would be to buy a DAS and an external HBA like the LSI 9200-8e and connect it to any old computer with a free PCI-e slotâ€“server, tower, whatever you can find for the cheapest or have on hand.  The Lenovo ThinkServer SA120 has 12 x 3.5" hotswap bays (couldn't find anything too cheap at the moment, all $300+.)    Or the Dell Xyratex Compellent HB-1235 for about $70    5. Throw some hot swap bays in the 5.25" bays of a normal tower  Title is pretty self explanatory here. The value is that you won't need an HBA card; the devil is finding a case with that many 5.25" bays in this day and age and in cost effective adapters.  The Antec 900, AZZA GT1, Azza Genesis 9000 and Cooler Master Storm Trooper all have 9 5.25" bays for around $100 with varying looks.       Older cases like the Lian Li PC-A17 and such also have a high number, but availability on anything with lots 5.25" bays is mediocre. There's a chance you can find something on Craigslist or the like, but no guarantees.  The adapters aren't cheap either; this StarTech one is $24.06.    OP has also pointed out that SuperMicro makes the CSE-M35T-1B a 3 x 5.25" to 10 x 3.5" bay for $100.    This gives some more flex in case choices, starting from about $50 and working up. Just pick one you like.  These are still expensive solutions though, and if you're not getting something equally hot swappable or just jury-rigging something yourself, you might as well just get a normal case and stick the drives in normal 3.5" mounts.
You've got two conflicting criteria: noise cancelling and shallow in the ear. Anything noise cancelling is also going to be as noise isolating as possible to avoid letting in excess sound to minimize the job the active cancellation needs to do.  The best I can recommend would be something from Bose's in-ear lineup. They've all got inline mics and wired 3.5mm options, and of course, active noise cancelling.  The SoundSport and SoundTrue both offer most of what you're asking for and aren't super expensive (around the $50-100 point), but only offer okay noise cancelling. The SoundTrue sounds slightly better while costing more.    The QuietComfort 20s offer much better noise cancelling, but are well out of your budget ($200-250 pricepoint)â€“however, if you're willing to buy used or from a third party, they might be a good option.    I haven't personally used the SoundSport or SoundTrue and am basing my suggestions on comparisons to headphones I do own. I own the QC20s and (though I do enjoy them) prefer over-ears, so they don't get an immense amount of use.
TL;DR: It doesn't matter, pick a carrier with the best service in your area and get the appropriate SIM.  To understand why it doesn't matter, let's understand what a SIM is.     A subscriber identity module or subscriber identification module (SIM) is an integrated circuit that is intended to securely store the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number and its related key, which are used to identify and authenticate subscribers on mobile telephony devices (such as mobile phones and computers).   The SIM is only being queried occasionally to check your identity on the network. Think of it as your ID when you go to a club: it only gets checked to verify your identity; it has no role in what you do in the club besides that.  All the actual transmission is up to the hardware in your phone and in the cell tower. Since you have no control over the cell towers, all you can do is choose a phone with good hardware and a network with good coverage in your area.
TL;DR: They're basically identical. I think it may be a case of switching the part number for a different retailer.  Acer even uses the exact same images to represent them on the product pages, down to the URL.         |    A315-51-31GK |     A315-51-380T        |â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“|â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“   MSRP |         $399.99 |             $349 Height |           0.85" |            0.82"   The A315-51-31GK appears to be sold at Newegg, the Intel Store. Microcenter, SuperBiiz, Jet, and Amazon, while the A315-51-380T appears to be sold at Walmart and Amazon.  My best guess is this is a case of Acer using different part numbers to prevent price matching between certain stores.  Amazon doesn't directly price match, so carrying both doesn't hurt them. It seems strange though that Walmart and Jet (who is owned by Walmart) would carry different products though.
TL;DR: Don't. Get an SD card.  Let's start by taking a tour of your MacBook's I/O:     For sake of simplicity and feasibility, we'll explore three options here: USB, Thunderbolt, and SD.  USB  Contrary to your original question, you do have USB 3.0! We won't go into it much, but the newer port you're referring to is USB 3.1 Type C.   USB 3.0 has a maximum speed of 5 Gb/sâ€“below SATA 3's 6 GB/s, but still above most (even fairly fast) SSDs. All good then, right?  Unfortunately, through a combination of packet problems, controller issues (either on the computer or enclosure end), and general magic, USB 3.0 just... isn't that fast. I'm not particularly well equipped to say why, and I wouldn't be surprised if more in-depth analysis revealed flawed testing methodology, but that's the fact of the matter... for now. Still, 3.360 Gb/s isn't anything to scoff at, nor is it too far from advertised.  Thunderbolt 2  Thunderbolt is kinda the big daddy of external expansion. It advertises 20 Gb/s over a 4x PCI-e 2.0 connection. And for the most part, it delivers... 11 Gb/s. Akito specifically cites the chipset (rather than the protocol) as the limiting factor. Still, that's enough to handle the fastest SATA SSDs, and even decent PCI-e drives.  SD[XC]  The SD spec promises speed up to 2500 Mb/s for UHS-II. You won't get that on a MacBook Pro, since the reader is connected over a USB busâ€“in your case, USB 3.   One thing to note is that the maximum file size you can put on an SD card varies. Normal SD cards support 2GB (avoid!), SDHC cards support 32GB, and SDXC cards support 2TB.  Choosing your connection  With this in mind, we get the following:   USB enclosure: Lower speed, greater flexibility with drive choice, medium price Thunderbolt enclosure: Better speed, greater flexibility with drive choice, PCI-e support, high price SD: Lower speed, lower flexibility with drive choice, low cost, much better portability   Note that USB and Thunderbolt are fundamentally incompatible specifications; you cannot convert Thunderbolt to USB.  Given that you're using this for secondary storage on a computer with an already very fast SSD and (based on the fact that you said $100-150 was too expensive) price is important, SD cards seem like the way to go. You can even get ones that lie flush with the rest of your laptop, or microSD adapters that allow you to bring your own SD card.    Since you haven't provided a specific price or storage requirement, I can't get more specific than that.  If you have no regard for money or physical space considerations, the Sony 128GB SF-G Series UHS-II is among the best I know of, and comes with a 5 year warranty and data recovery to boot, though I would advise against this. I would recommend something along the lines of the SanDisk 128GB Extreme UHS-I and one of those microSD flush-fitting adapters from earlier.  The exception to this is if you want a large amount of storage (256GB+ mostly.) SD cards at this price point are still much more expensive than their desktop counterparts while offering worse performance, though this breaking point will likely change in the future as SSD prices continue to drop.
The Zettaly Avy seems to be a good option, though I'm not sure if this is still in your "cheap" range.  It has a full Android tablet, pretty up-to-date with Android 6.0 (not the latest...but not that bad either) and comes with the Google Play Store.  Here On Amazon for $129.99
TL;DR: The LG 24MP59G-P/LG 24MP59HT-P  â‚¬2501 is a pretty massive budget for a monitor of that size and resolution. At this price point, I'd consider decent color (read: IPS) non-negotiable. Since you mentioned gaming and programming (not content creation), I'm guessing perfect color isn't too important though. For that reason, I focused on providing a better gaming experience.  With both of these monitors, you get a 75Hz refresh rate with Freesync. IMO, these features make gaming (even relatively casual gaming) much, much better.  Beyond that, compared to the Dell monitors you suggested:   â‰ˆâ‚¬30 cheaper (about â‚¬125) Slightly thicker bezels Slightly worse out-of-the-box calibration Some backlight bleed Fewer creature comforts (Monitor-dependent) No built-in speakers or USB hub   Given how much room you have left in your budget, it should be within your budget to get a nice USB hub and set of bookshelf speakers.  Between the G and HT models, the difference appears to be in vendors (BestBuy carries only the HT, the G is carried more universally) and inputs (the HT has 2x HDMI and 1x VGA, the G has 1x DisplayPort, 1x HDMI, and 1x VGA.) I'd recommend the G if you can find it (DisplayPort tends to have fewer issues with Freesync.)   I don't know know where you live or what actual prices are as a result, so I'll be using USD and converting.
Per monitor, as that's the maximum a single Displayport 1.4 port can provide.  For example, this video show a Titan X (Maxwell) pushing 3x4K displays with the card listing a Maximum Digital Resolution of 5120x3200.
Would suggest you check task manager/process (sort by cpu) and see what is causing the 100% cpu utilization. Adding more memory helps if the computer is constantly hitting hard drive cache which is an order of a magnitude slower, which you can check under task manager/performance. But its not gonna help if its just a case of some services going bad or to many other programs loaded that need lots of cpu.
The manufacturer will usually be right, and it can be limited by the memory slot itself or the motherboard.  And they clearly say:     DDR3L 1600 MHz SDRAM, 2 GB, up to 16 G, (8 GB x 2), 2x DIMM socket,   DIMM Up to 8 G   So the only way to really make sure is to buy and test...
Have a look at this link. Your CPU needs a good upgrade, as you said. Since you want something for a few years ahead, I would recommend an something like i7-6700 or newer. Because you said you had a budget, don't look at the X-series. These things are just overpriced I think. But since you are at it, consider upgrade RAM as well.  Here are my recommendations:   ASRock z370 PRO4 for $145 USD Intel i5-8600k for $321 USD   And just consider upgrading RAM to like 32GB if you want
TL;DR: You'll need a different laptop. More info on your requirements would be good so I can make a better reccomendation.  Natively  Right out of the gate, Microsoft says no.  Surface            | External displays | Max refresh rate | Max screen resolution â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“|â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“|â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“|â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“ Surface Book 2 15â€ | One               | 60 Hz            | 4096 x 2304 Surface Book 2 15â€ | Two               | 30 Hz            | 4096 x 2304 Surface Book 2 15â€ | Two               | 60 Hz            | 2560 x 1600   But I'm not one to believe Microsoft. After all, it is a DisplayPort 1.4 signal being carried by that USB-C connector in theory, supporting up to an 8K@60Hz signal, as confirmed by the GTX 1060 specs. 3x4K@60Hz should be no biggie, right?  Problem: How does one connect up three displays using one connector? Answer: With an MST hub! Problem: Every MST hub I know of is DisplayPort 1.2 rated, and can't support 3x4k@even 30Hzâ€“even ones advertised for the (admittedly last gen) Surface products. (I've personally tested this one myself with a Surface Pro 4 and 2x1440p@60Hz.) Even the official Surface Dock only has two Mini DisplayPort connectors.  So while it may be possible, Microsoft certainly won't support it, and the hardware doesn't exist as far as I know.  eGPU  USB-C is one of those confusing things: it refers both to a physical connector and a communications protocol. Though Thunderbolt 3 uses USB-C type connectors, they are not one and the same. The Surface Book 2 does not support Thunderbolt 3 (or any other Thunderbolt revision), and therefore cannot support eGPUs.  What now?  Without knowing your budget, use case, and the features you want, it's kinda hard to recommend a laptop. However, based off the fact that you like the Surface Book, I'll recommend the Eve V with an Akitio Node as your eGPU box. It's a direct competitor to the Surface Pro, and includes a Thunderbolt 3 port, so eGPU will work fine.  Obviously there's a lot of trade offs here: eGPUs are expensive (the Akitio Node is the cheapest reasonable box I know of and still costs $250) and take a significant performance hit, you won't get the relative safety in terms of warranty and support of an established brand like Microsoft with the Eve V (though it was reviewed well), and the Eve V isn't an outstanding performer for every workload. Butâ€“based on the information you've given me (read: give me more info)â€“it's the best recommendation I can make.
Assuming this is a typical logic board, PCIe is a lower-level connection.  In other words, PCIe is actually a 'direct connect' into the PCI buss.. On the other hand, USB is usually routed thru the PCI buss THEN thru a USB controller chip, to then run thru the USB circuit.  This means that data would be handled faster thru PCIe, rather than thru the USB busses..  The speed difference of SSD would be somewhat lost by going thru USB. Additionally, a USB based assembly might well cause  you further issues with issues such as auto-mount, etc....
Most companies that produce RAID controllers have similar options.  What your doing isn't even hard, people do 256 hard drives via SAS/SATA expanders and chasis like the one listed below.  Clearly you need an adaptec raid controller card. The 71685 supports 24 devices natively.  https://storage.microsemi.com/en-us/support/raid/sas_raid/sas-71685/   4 internal and 2 external connectors.  Each support 4 drives natively.  https://ark.intel.com/products/60273/Intel-RAID-Expander-RES2CV240#@productimages  Then you add SATA/SAS expanders and you can add up to 255/6 devices.  https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811192419&ignorebbr=1&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC--pla--Server+-+Chassis-_-N82E16811192419&gclid=CjwKCAiA7JfSBRBrEiwA1DWSGyLCmrUMtGV2pRlZ-JC6baIFzL5alLwQiVeEXKzQUsiiONg6cUxbYBoCLmwQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds

TL;DR: A cheap drawing tablet, probably from Wacom's Intuos or Bamboo linups. (the same company you linked.)  Drawing tablets are made exactly for this, of which Wacom is generally considered the industry go-to. While they've usually got nice integration with apps like Illustrator or Photoshop to utilize fancy features like pressure levels, they've also got functionality as a mouse! Usually, there's a proximity sensory to determine if the mouse should be moved and a tip in a special pen to determine when you're pressing and then perform the appropriate function. Since it's all software programable, you can just have it left click when the tip is pressed!  From their current lineup, the Intuos Draw is the cheapest, and should get the job done just fine for $79.95.    However, Wacom has been around since 1983, so there's plenty of new and old stock to choose from. I picked up a Wacom Bamboo CTH-460 for $21 NIB from Goodwill, and you'll see similar prices with lots and lots of availability.    Wacom also offers tablets with screens and paper-to-digital functionality, but they're quite expensive, and IMO, probably not worth it.  I'm not aware of any ball-based drawing tablet, though the idea is interesting.
TL;DR: Your motherboard + an LSI 9211-8i, or just a motherboard with more SATA ports.  Motherboard upgrade  If you're willing to manage with a slightly lower amount of ports, just get a motherboard with a bunch of SATA ports! The most I know of is 22 on the ASRock Z87 Extreme11/ac.  You'll notice two things though:   You can't find this board. Seriously, good luck. The specifications say "22 x SATA3 (16 x SAS3 12.0 Gb/s + 6 x SATA3 6.0 Gb/s) from LSI SAS 3008 Controller+ 3X24R Expander"   Intel only supports up to 6 SATA-III ports on the various LGA 1150 and LGA 1151 chipsets, 10 on X99 and 8 (???) on X299 (though the MSI X299 XPOWER GAMING AC supports 10.) AMD supports 6 on X370 and X399 apparently caps out at 8. Basically, that ASRock motherboard just has another third party SATA controller built in. That's no fun!   This leads us to the section option:  Add another SATA controller  @cybernard has the right idea, but I'm going to disagree with his hardware choice.  Though it's not 100% clear, it seems implied by your post that you don't need hardware RAID support, at least at a controller level. Basically, we just want to present the system with just a bunch of disks (JBOD.) This is going to allow us to save a massive amount of money compared using dedicated hardware RAID card on a card like the Adaptec RAID 71685 (retails for $1120!) which would need to have every drive connected to it (if we used the hardware RAID), since we can continue to use the onboard SATA ports.  To accomplish this, we're going to use a much, much cheaper HBA: the LSI 9211-8i (also known as the IBM M1015, or the compatible Dell Perc H200/H310.)    It has 2 x two SFF-8087 mini-SAS connectors, each supporting four 6Gb/s connections (the max for SATA-III) and up to 256 physical devices, and can be easily connected to standard SATA data using a breakout cable.    It's popular, cheap (roughly $40), andâ€“with a little workâ€“supports JBOD. Here's a quick guide on how to set it up.   There's a wealth other cards as well, like the monstrous 40-Channel SATA 6Gbps HighPoint Rocket 750, but they're far, far more expensive, and probably overkill for your needs. Remember, you can use multiple cards, and as long as you're not bottlenecking, port multiplication is fine. Internal SATA III 1 to 5 cards can be had as low as $60; you don't need a fancy backplane (though if you're into fancy cases with fancy hot swap, boy have I got a post for you!)
Your problem is 3.5" hard drives require 12v.  Most other 2.5" hard drives run only on 5v.  In theory you could up converter 5V to 12V, but you need even more amps.  There simply aren't enough amp available with USB 1,2, or 3 to do this.  The USB 3.1 standard will support enough current.  However, there aren't that many motherboards that support usb 3.1.  If you can get USB 3.1, and find an external hard drive enclosure it should work.  A hard drive usually takes 700ma @ 12v  *2.4 (5v to 12) * 1.2 (20% loss in the conversion process)= approx 2100ma + 600ma @ 5v = 2700ma. Some hard drives require significantly more so read the label on the hdd for actual power draw.

TL;DR: Because CPUBoss doesn't compare on pure performance basis, I wouldn't bother upgrading, the X5470 is better, high prices are a result of ease of use, it won't hurt anything but if it works depends on the motherboard.  CPUBoss  CPUBoss doesn't evaluate from a pure performance, but rather a more wholistic perspective. For example, the Core 2 Duo E8400 scores a 5.9 while the i7 5960X scores a 5.8, despite the E8400 being worse by miles in every way except price.  Anecdotally, I've found that CPU/GPUBoss provide very poor metric for comparing hardware, outside of their aggregation of benchmarks and specifications (and even then, those are often lackluster compared to the original sources, i.e. GeekBench, Passmark, and ARK.)  Which processor is better?  I'd recommend looking just at the Passmark numbers. The X5470 wins with 4662 compared to the Q8400's 3187.  Is it worth the upgrade?  I'd say no. Compared to other LGA 775/LGA 771 processors and even newer platforms, the X5470 is incredibly expensive at around $40. You'd be better off jumping ship to a slightly newer platform, or investing in solid cooling (which can transfer in the future) and overclocking heavily. I won't go too in depth, but with more info on budget and requirements (read: another question) I'd be happy to.  Price of old processors  The Q8400 isn't expensive, at around $17. The QX9650 is expensive at around $60 because it's a top tier chip, and those tend to hold their value because of their ongoing usefulness as a way to squeeze a little more performance out of old systems. Notice also the X in the name: this designates it as a Core 2 Extreme processor, whichâ€“besides just being top of the lineâ€“means with it comes with an unlocked multiplier.  I won't go into too much detail, but basically, it's easier to overclock these processors than ones with locked multipliers. Compared to processors from after the switch to QPI (anything after LGA 771/LGA 775/PGA 604), where effectively only unlocked processors (K, X) can be overclocked (base clock overclocking is difficult and largely ineffective at squeezing more performance these days), FSB overclocking was common and quite effective. This lead to less demand for chips with unlocked multipliers, and thus, even higher rarity of these chips.  Xeons processors tend to hit the used market in large quantities with low prices as server which aren't economical to run anymore because of high power consumption compared to newer processors are parted out after 5-10 years. Though the delta between old Core 2 Quads and their equivalent Xeons is falling as Core 2 Quads become increasingly obsolete even in consumer PCs and LGA 771 Xeon availability falls as the server supply dwindles, this still holds somewhat true, and very much so for newer Xeons.  LGA 771 "modding'  Because the mainstream LGA 775 and server LGA 771 platforms are so similar, buying cheap Xeons salvaged from old servers and "modding" them to work in consumer motherboards allows better (higher base clocks and better binning), cheaper chips to be run in cheaper motherboards that support overclocking and other consumer features.  This does require modifications both to the chip and the motherboard in the form of a pad-flipping sticker and removing the CPU guides respectively. Though I won't go into too much depth as this isn't the focus of the answer, you can read more about it here. Note that it is motherboard dependent: Nvidia based chipsets (650i, 680i, 780i, 790i) and some Intel chipsets (P35, P45, G31, G41) should work fine, while other Intel chipsets (X38, X48) only work with X33 series Xeons. Beyond this, some motherboards outright won't work anyways; the best you can do is Google if anyone else has had success with this (since the CPUs won't be on the QVL anyways), update your motherboard as much as possible, and give it a shot.  This articles lists the E5472, X5460, X5450, E5420 (E0), L5420, E5405 as working with the mod and your motherboard.
TL;DR: The Ryzen 1700.  Since you stated server and used gear is out of the question, have no interest in the extra difficulty incurred by programming for GPUs/add in cards like Knight's Landing, and AVX-512 is currently limited to the expensive Skylake-X platform, it's basically a straight comparison of multithreaded performance at that price point.  Looking at a list of processors near this price point, the Ryzen 1700X and 1700 come out on top in core count. The only other 8 core is the Xeon E5-2609 V4 which runs at a measly 1.7GHz on the older X99 platform. Intel's similar hexacores at this price point are the i7-6850K and i5-8600k.

Ryzen 1700, Ryzen 1700X, i7-6850K, i5-8600k.  As shown by these benchmarks, there's a bit of a smattering of who's on top. Geekbench leans towards Intel's single threaded performance being king, while Userbenchmark leans towards Ryzen's cores. Without a benchmark using your workload, it's impossible to tell exactly how things will bench, but I'm inclined to lean towards more cores with a slower individual clock for your workload.  Since none of these platforms use DDR3, there's no real advantage towards shifting towards one platform based on memory. Though there may be a slight platform cost incurred by the need for faster memory with Zen processors (especially with RAM prices so high right now), this is relatively small and outweighed heavily by the cheaper motherboard costâ€“A320 is a perfectly valid option since you're not overclockingâ€“though you may find that a slightly more expensive B350 board provides some nice creature comforts for just a few bucks.
I would go with a laser printer.  You can get black/white or color laser printers.  The color laser printers are true laser printers.  They contain 4 toner cartridges.  Many laser printers are available as part of a multi-function device, where you can print, scan and fax.  Now.... some laser printers are vastly cheaper to operate than others.  For example, I have an old HP M2727nf.  This is a black/white multi function printer.  It takes HP toner cartridges.  HP uses a 4 digit code for cartridges.  Some printers can accommodate high capacity toner cartridges and HP (and 3rd parties) make these cartridges and they are suffixed with the letter X.  For example, 1234 and 1234X.  1234X is the high capacity cartridge.  My M2727nf printer can print about 7,000 impressions on one high capacity cartridge.  These cost about $20 (3rd party), so each impression costs .285 cents.  I also have an HP color laser printer.  The cartridges for this are much more expensive and there are no high capacity cartridges available.  Impressions on this printer are around 10 cents a page, so the older printer is around 50 times cheaper to operate.  So you could buy a new laser printer that takes high capacity toner cartridges and you should be able to print for well under a penny a page.
Like @mbmast says in the comments, it might be more logical to have a full AV Receiver. That is the device that is meant to do this.  But as for a TV, I think that the 2017 Visio P55-E1 ticks most, if not all, your requirements:  https://www.vizio.com/tvs/pseries/p55e1.html
As all these kind of questions...there is no 1+1 answer...and honestly any 10", $150 and up, tablet should be good enough.  But for really good resolution and adequate battery size, I'd suggest one of the 2 (depending on how much you're willing to shell out):   The ASUS ZenPad 3S 10 9.7" for $284 The (flagship) Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 9.7" for somewhat below $500
The used market is awash w/nice OC mboards and CPUs. Intel's i7-980X cpu in their DX58XSO will save you $$$ and enable you to use your GTX1060. The chipset on the DX58SO has OC performance adjustments for bus, cpu, mem, etc., in BIOS. All this is available on the used market for pennies on the dollar. Some places even sell warranties for a little cash. You already know some research/reading the specs to assure this will fit your need is a MUST DO!. :-) Your DDR3 1600Mhz will wrk in the board and perhaps can be OCd. Look to possibly find an improved monitor for high refresh and Mhz to shoot at 38xx X 26xx DPI. AS you have mentined, BUDGET determines the buy :-). Happy unprades and good succes.

TL;DR: The All New Fire HD 10.  Since price seems to be a major concern for you, I'm going to sacrifice in it's name. However, I think this should still pass quite fine for what you're doing, if not excellent.  With the Fire, some cons are:   Low res screen (only 1920x1200 for a 10.1" device = 224.17 PPI, about 85% of an iPad Pro 10.5" and about 48% of an iPhone X) Fairly low storage capacity No cellular capability Very slightly slow (roughly 75% of the Apple A10X Fusion in the most recent iPad Pro, only 2GB of memory) Runs Fire OS, and getting "normal" Android things (like the Google Play store) is very possible, but takes a bit of extra work.   Besides that though, it's actually a surprisingly good device. It has an IPS display, proper dual band AC wireless solution, Bluetooth, a microSD slot (a real rarity these days) to mitigate the storage issue, a surprisingly good battery, is very rugged, and costs a mere $150 for the 32GB model, basically creaming anything at that price point and size. Compared especially to the old Fire HD 10, it's amazing.  Going over your requirements briefly then:   Reading PDF files: Yes. It's a Kindle. If there's one thing it can do, it's read books. Showing pictures to people: Yes, though your app of choice may not be available without a little extra effort. Browsing the Internet: Yes, and has a pretty good wireless solution to boot Use a desktop PC remotely: Yes; I recommend TeamViewer, which is available on the Amazon store as well (free!) 10" screen: Yes Resolution: Not awful, but not great Cheap price: Yes, incredibly. Durability: Yes, it's actually market heavily as a durable tablet. Battery: It's going to degrade as much as any other lithium-ion (they're all basically the same), but it should do a solid 8-10 hours on a charge. It also won't throttle when the battery begins to degrade too much (looking at you, Apple.) Reputable retailer: It's literally an Amazon product. Physical keyboard: Yes, either with the (rather expensive) $60 official flush keyboard or any generic Bluetooth keyboard. Anti-reflective screen: Very few devices use matte screens these days, your best bet is a matte screen protector. They're available on the extremely cheap (from Amazon as well.
My Moto z is great, especially if you buy the battery mod attachment. It's big, and a bit heavy, but it usually lasts at least the day and into the next morning before I have to charge, depending on how much use it has (if it isn't used a lot, I'm sure it'll last quite a bit longer). I like this phone otherwise for the awesome camera, and decent interface.
You can find several Androids with great battery life. The longest seems to be the ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom ($319 on Amazon), Which Tom's Guide called in June, "Longest Battery Life Ever". And it is a pretty capable phone in every sense.  Something a bit more expansive and not as good battery life, but still above average, is the Blackberry -Android running- Key One  And at last, if this is such an important thing for you, just take some time and read some guides to familiarize yourself with all the ways to make sure to get out the most of the battery that you have. A guide like How to make your Android smartphone's battery last longer from the good folks at Android Pit can help a lot! And you can even experiment with turning On Battery Saver Mode (usually turns On when the phone is low battery) the whole time.
TL;DR: Active cables, choose a length.  Normal DisplayPort (passive) cables cap out at 3 meters. These cables are basically just bundles of copper with connectors at each end.  However, you can get more expensive active cables that use electronics built into the cable to extend the range. These cap out at 33 meters, though the longest I could find for sale is 15 meters. Note that these really are expensive though, with that cable costing about $80.  Because these cables have built in electronics, make sure you read the specifications for each cable to ensure compatibility. FreeSync should be good pretty much no matter what, but check resolution, audio, directionality, and HDCP support. The 15m cable I linked supports a unidirectional 2560x1600@60Hz signal with audio and HDCP.  If for some reason you need to go more than 15m, you can run DisplayPort over CAT5. If you've got money to burn, or need to maintain a high bandwith connection an extremely long distance, there are optical DisplayPort cables and more generic DisplayPort to optical converters, starting at $270 for 3 meters and going to $1750 for 100 meters or $1000 flat for the converters. If you start getting concerned about caring other data along for the ride, you could use an optical Thunderbolt cable, which along with other data, can carry a DisplayPort connection up to 60m. It does cost $1000 though.
TL;DR: Try it first. If it's not enough, trash it, buy a cheap LGA 775 tower and upgrade it.  Your old tower  CS:GO is a pretty lightweight game, and if you really turn everything down, it can run on just about anything. This guide should allow you to squeeze a little out, andâ€“if you're willing to go a bit farther (though there's been some debate as to if this is VAC safe) this guide should be able to help you get even a potato to run CS:GO.  Normally I would post the information you need (at least roughly) here, but there's simply too much content.  However, there's only so much you can do, and if you're still unsatified with your performance, I can really only recommend getting a different PC.  I'm really not a fan of trashing hardwareâ€“anyone who knows me or has read my posts knows I'm a massive fan of upgrading and used hardware. The problem is there's almost nothing that can be done with your PC.  Problem 1: Your CPU  To put it simply: it's too weak. Sure, it may be a quad core, and sure, it may boost up to 2.64 GHz, but with a 6.5W TDP, it is not a performer. CS:GO is heavily CPU dependentâ€“especially single threaded performanceâ€“and this just can't keep up. It scores a mere 600 for a single thread in Passmark, getting thoroughly beaten by the 11-year-old Q6660, which scores a 924 without overclocking.  Problem 2: CPU upgrade  You can't. Though the spec page doesn't exactly make it clear, looking at some other J3710 equipped motherboards shows they are clearly soldered down.  Problem 3: GPU upgrade  HP prebuilt consumer towers are notorious for being annoying to install new GPUs intoâ€“however, even ignoring that, I can't recommend a GPU upgrade. There's almost zero information officially from HP as to if this is possible (I couldn't even find a picture of the motherboard), but we can makes some guesses. First, you're hard capped at 90W for your entire system, since as far as I can tell, the PSU is not upgradeable. This, combined with the fact that I wouldn't be surprised if your slot is capped at the lower 25W limit instead of the normal 75W limit as is fairly common among low end prebuilt, means I wouldn't trust anything above a GT 1030 to work. Though weak, the 1030 would still be enough for CS:GO. However, it costs $80â€“for which price, you can do much better.  A "new" rig  Base platform  The key here is used components. We're going to start with a base platform. LGA 775 is old enough that they can be found really, really cheap, but is still good enough to provide an entry level experience. My personal choice is the Optiplex 755 with the Optiplex 780 in second, but any tower with support for a Core 2 Quad should work just fine. You should be able to find one for sale for $5-25; here's an eBay listing for $17.99. Your best bet to maximize value will be to search Craigslist and your local surplus markets (especially since you'll be able to save all that shipping cost); I find universities often have good stock of these older towers.   CPU upgrade  You'll need to check your platform first, but across the board, Core 2 Quads are very cheap. The Optiplex 755 can take a Q6600 (about $8.50), while the Optiplex 780 can take a Q8300 (about $7.00.) You can also try overclocking a hair to squeeze a little more performance using SetFSB.  Memory  Find the cheapest 4GB set of DDR2 available at the minimum speed required by your system. Make sure not to buy ECC or FBDIMM RAM, as these are not compatible. Craigslist may again be useful, or it may not. Here's a 2x2GB set for $8.10.  PSU upgrade  Buying cheap power supplies is never a great experience, but it'll have to do. Because there's so much variability, you'll need search around a bit. Check Craisglist and /r/buildapcsales. Here's a CX450W for $17.99.  GPU  Again, there's going to be a bit of shopping around hereâ€“what you can get will also depend on what PSU you got. The 9800GT for around $13 should do the trick, but I'd recommend the HD 5850 for around $25 if you can spare, or the HD 6950 for around $40 if you'd like to step it up a bit.  With a little time and effort, you've put together a decent little gaming PC for $50-100! I guarantee you this will play better than trying to upgrade your old PC for the same cost.
TL;DR: It will run at that speed, and it will be an asset in some workloads.  Memory overclocking and XMP  Intel specifies that their CPUs (here, the 7700K) are guaranteed to work with DDR4-2133/2400, DDR3L-1333/1600 @ 1.35V. Anything beyond that isn't officially part of their specifications, or guaranteed to work. However, in practice, it will.  What's going on here is overclockingâ€“basically, pushing stuff beyond it's manufacturer rated speeds. This practice isn't unsafe, and, in the case of memory, is basically supported by the manufacturer. Here, the RAM manufacturer certifies that the RAM will work at 2666 MHz. Though the motherboard manufacturer only guarantees that RAM at 2133/2400 MHz will work, it supports overclocking up to 3733 MHz and beyond (and effectively guarantees it will work.) Similarly, Intel allows their CPUs to work with overclocked RAM (and effectively guarantees it will work.)  Because memory overclocking takes work, Intel created something called XMP, or Extreme Memory Profile. Basically, this is a list of settings stored on the memory modules that tell the motherboard what speeds it says it can overclock to and what timings it needs to do so. Most motherboards will then automatically discover and load those settings, though some may require manual configuration. The end result is the same though: the memory runs at its "overclocked" speed.  RAM speed as an asset  Though I won't dive into it too much, how muchâ€“if at allâ€“RAM speed matters depends on your workload. This video does a much better job examining it then I could ever do, but the basic conclusion is that it matters a little in some games (more on Ryzen then other platforms) and varies widely for other workloads. If you're building for gaming, don't sweat it too much; if you're building for some other task, Google around and see what other people have experienced.
TL;DR: Maybe sort of, but not for the reason you're thinking.  Memory overclocking and XMP  Intel specifies that their CPUs (here, the 6820HK) are guaranteed to work with DDR4-2133, LPDDR3-1866, and DDR3L-1600.

Though this isn't really as important for your system (since it's a prebuilt), the technology is the same as any desktop, and is still applicable if you decide to upgrade your memory down the line.

5 TB you can get in 2.5". Like this one: http://amzn.to/2ArkWGg. And then you can use any of the mini-PC line.  As for your question, there are some ASUS VivoMini PCs that support a 3.5" HDD.  For instance see in this review on the VM62N-G050R:     but this mini PC has a unique dual-bay design that allows for a 3.5"   drive or two 2.5" drives
TL;DR: Every AM4 ITX board (so far) supports ECC but not RDIMMs  Registered DIMMs won't work on Ryzen, plain and simple. Ryzen isn't validated for ECC support on consumer chipsets and, as a result, AMD doesn't officially support it. ECC support is however enabled, and certain motherboard manufactures do validate ECC memory.  Here's a list of AM4 ITX boards that have been validated with ECC memory:   ASRock AB350 Gaming-ITX/ac   Adata AD4E2133W8G15-BHYA 2133 8GB UDIMM Crucial CT8G4WFD824A.18FB1 2400 8GB UDIMM Samsung M391A1G43EB1-CPBQ 2133 8GB UDIMM  ASRock X370 Gaming-ITX/ac   Adata AD4E2133W8G15-BHYA 2133 8GB UDIMM Crucial CT8G4WFD824A.18FB1 2400 8GB UDIMM Samsung M391A1G43EB1-CPBQ 2133 8GB UDIMM  Asus ROG STRIX B350-I GAMING   Transcent TS1GLH72V1H 2133 8GB UDIMM  Asus ROG STRIX X370-I GAMING   Transcent TS1GLH72V1H 2133 8GB UDIMM  Biostar B350GTN   Apacer 78.B1GM4.4020B 2133 4GB UDIMM Apacer 78.C1GM4.AF10B 2133 8GB UDIMM Hynix HMA41GU7AFR8N-TF 2133 8GB UDIMM  Biostar X370GTN   Apacer 78.B1GM4.4020B 2133 4GB UDIMM Apacer 78.C1GM4.AF10B 2133 8GB UDIMM Hynix HMA41GU7AFR8N-TF 2133 8GB UDIMM  Gigabyte GA-AB350N-Gaming WIFI (rev. 1.0)   Kingston KVR21E15S8/4 2133 4GB UDIMM Kingston KVR21E15D8/8HA 2133 8GB UDIMM Crucial CT4G4WFS8213.9FA1 2133 4GB UDIMM V-Color TE48G21S815 8GB UDIMM V-Color TE416G21D815 16GB UDIMM    Note that so far this is every AM4 ITX motherboard out there, and I'd expect this trend to continue, so any board here is likely to work.
A nas is not much different from a media server. It uses all the same parts. I haven't built many myself, so take this advice with a grain of salt. Other users will be more informed.  What you want is an mitx form factor nas case that can support multiple 3.5inch drives, ecc ram, and a low end xeon (or comparable) processor. (that said, if data integrity isn't a huge issue just go with an athlon or i-line intel and regular ram)  The SilverStone DS380 or any similiar case will fit your needs well. The amount of bays you have is your biggest limiting factor as 8 3.5 inch bays is...well kinda big.  p.s. You might want to also look into gigabit ethernet cards, but I am not the guy to ask about that.  p.p.s. The line between servers and consumer hardware is more about how beefy and reliable the hardware is. Double check to make sure you absolutely need something like a xeon before forking a large chunk of money at the thing.
TL;DR: Minor bugfixes and improvements.  The rest of my answer is predicated on the assumption that you basically want the cost to remain around the same point, as well as performance. See the body for more details.  PCPartPicker part list / Price breakdown by merchant  StackExchange, please add table support to your markdown.  Breakdown by component  CPU  Though personally I would advocate for a switch either to the 8600K or a Ryzen 7 1700 (or lower) to save cash, these create fundamentally different systems. The 8600K drops HTâ€“most workloads will stay the same, including gaming, but a few won't do quite as well; the Ryzen 7 1700 has significantly lower single core performance and won't do quite as well in games and other mostly single threaded workloads, but has two additional cores for multithreaded workloads, has SMT, and costs significantly less. As such, I've maintained the 8700K to keep the caliber the same, as well as the strengths.  Cooler  Same. IMO it's a great cooler, especially for the price, with clean looks to boot.  Thermal compound  Though there is compound included in the box, it's cheap silicone stuff. It's unlikely to really hurt performance in any meaningful way, but given the caliber of build you're building, a little Arctic Silver can't hurt. Plus, more thermal compound is always fun!  Motherboard  Probably the largest switch here. The main reason I made this switch was to integrate the wireless solution into the motherboard. This cleans up aesthetics and leaves I/O open, and gets you either (depending on the board) a much cheaper build or a much nicer board.  I picked the Asus ROG STRIX Z370-E Gaming board over two cheaper boards: the Gigabyte Z370 Aorus Gaming Wi-Fi and the ASRock Z370 Killer SLI/ac. The primary purpose here is looks: IMO, the RGB lighting, I/O cover, M.2 cover, and multiple RGB headers make this a flexible, good looking board. You also get better power delivery and some minor features in the BIOS, but these are largely secondary. If you think the fairly steep $80 price increase isn't worth it, I'd recommend the ASRock Z370 Killer SLI/ac; I've had some very poor experiences with Gigabyte support in the past and (though their products are fine in themselves) I prefer to stay away from them when possible.  Memory  The change here is fairly minor, but I gave a little more flex in RAM speed in return for a slightly cheaper price. The return on investment for higher speed memory isn't worth the money for the most part above 2666 MHz on Z370.   Storage  I picked the much faster (roughly 40%) and only slightly more expensive Samsung 850 EVO M.2 over the WD Blue M.2. It's green, which is a bit of a bummer, but if you go with a motherboard with an M.2 cover, you won't be able to see it anyways. Neither of these drives are what I'd describe as particularly fast though, and even fast SATA SSDs will beat them. If you're willing to sacrifice a little bit of cleanliness, I might recommend the slightly cheaper and faster Samsung 850 EVO-Series 500GB 2.5", along with maybe an HDD for mass storage.  Video card  As much as I'm a fan of the Founder Edition look, it just doesn't make much sense outside of a small form factor case or water cooling. FE cards run hot, and the EVGA Superclocked model is barely any more expensive and should perform better while running cooler and quieter.  Depending on what resolution and framerate you're targeting in what games, a GTX 1080 may be rather overkill. If you can give me more info on those, that'd be great.  Case  You're spending a lot of money, I'd treat myself to the improved S340 Elite. It's got a larger glass side panel than the original. That's the main thing.  Most of my time with my rig has been in an S340 (not Elite.) Nice case.  PSU  Not that your PSU was a bad choice, just that a similar power supply with a slightly higher wattage could be had for a little cheaper. To be fair, the RM650x is a slightly better power supply than the Toughpower Grand aside from that. Really, anything that fits the parametric filter should be fine; pick a power supply as you deem appropriate from there.  OS  No changes really. There are other ways to get cheap keys, but I won't go into those since they're a bit of a grey area.  Answers to questions   Yes Yes No since you'll get some in the box, but I'd recommend it because of the cooler choice. Monitor, keyboard, mouse! Maybe headphones or speakers. Sort of. See the main body. Again, see main body. Use a magnetic screwdriver if you have one. Go slow, be careful inserting the CPU, remember your I/O shield. Yes, CPU coolers can be a bit of a pain. Remember your motherboard standoffs. Cable management really makes things look much better. Keep all the boxes and the CPU socket cover. Have fun!
Have you heard of dc-dc powersupplies? This is definitely up your alley. You can also grab a portable usb monitor, everything else is up to what you want.  Failing that you can also grab an inverter to run a regular old plug to your pc. Just be careful not to drain your battery completely. Lower power use is better!
If you're doing anything super intensive editing wise I'd go for a quadro, but if you're just splicing clips, making wedding vids and the like a 1070/1080 will do you fine. I think you'll benefit more from single core performance in this build. Go for intel.  One thing to consider are accessories like the palette gear if you do a lot of editing on a regular basis.
You'll want a dedicated displayport repeater as cables often break.  Keep in mind the further you go the higher your latency will be, and the more repeater you'll need. Only go this route if you absolutely need it.
TL;DR: An Inwin IW-MS04, Fractal Design Node 304, or Silverstone DS380.  For the purpose of this, I'll be pretty much sticking to 3.5" HDDsâ€“both since that's in the question, and since 3.5" HDDs still contain several advantages. Though high density 2.5" drives are becoming more and more commonâ€“@Yisroel Tech pointed out a 5TB driveâ€“they're still not what I'd consider "ready." As of yet, most of these drives are intended as secondary for laptops: high density, 5400RPM, desktop drives (read: not rated for 24/7 usage nor-more importantlyâ€“high vibration environments.) They're also generally much more expensive than their 3.5" counterparts, especially given the ability to shuck WD Reds from external enclosures. Though 2.5" drives have also become common in the data center, these are high speed SAS drives, not SATA, and don't really make sense for a desktop build, especially when price is at a premium. In general, they're still also more expensive than their 3.5" counterparts.  Methodology  Basically, I went through PCPartPicker's list of Mini ITX cases, then for each case that looked promising, looked up the manufacturer specs on volume. For sake of transparency and record-keeping, here's the table I produced (you'll need something to render Markdown tables with, since StackExchange still doesn't support them.)

Inwin IW-MS04  At 13.3 liters with support for 4x3.5" HDDs hidden behind a pretty face, this case is pretty impressive in itself. What's more, these drives are hot swappable. However, this does come at a cost: though it comes with a 265W Bronze PSU, you probably won't be able to upgrade from this if you decide to, since the case only supports Flex ATX power supplies. The $160 price tag doesn't help either. Oh well. Still worth a look if you meet the power requirements!  Fractal Design Node 304  At 19.6 liters with support for 6x3.5" HDDs with support for full ATX PSUs up to 160mm in length, this case sure packs a lot into a little package, and for $100, isn't too expensive either. Fractal Design also has an awesome reputation and good looks.  Silverstone DS380  Unfortunately @Nicholas Martin got to suggest this before I could, so I'll just have to second the quality of this case. At 21.6 liters with support for 8x3.5" HDDs in hot swap bays, this is the best in drives/volume. It's not too expensive at $150, but you will need a more expensive SFX or SFX-L PSU. Silverstone also has a solid reputation and good looks.  Discontinued cases  Sadly, there are several cases which I would have loved to recommend, but are discontinued and out of stock: the Lian-Li PC-Q26, Fractal Design Array R2, Lian-Li PC-Q08, and Rosewill Legacy V6-B. If you can find one of these used, they're amazing options, but my guess is they were discontinued due to low volume sales, as they're fairly specialized products.  Not-quite recommended  The Inwin BP671 is a cool little case at a mere 8.2L that supports 2x3.5" drives. However, the bundled 200W TFX PSU is just too weak and too sketchy for my recommendation, and availability of TFX PSUs is quite low.  The Silverstone RVZ01B and Silverstone FTZ01 are both neat little cases at only 14L, but 1x3.5" drive is just too little for NAS purposes.  Really small cases  If you were paying extra close attention, you'll notice at the bottom of my table I listed three cases that don't even support 3.5" drives! Okay, yes, I said I wasn't going to do this, but I had to mention them if not recommend them. They're all extremely tiny, extremely well built, extremely expensive cases. Even though they're not really appropriate for this application, they're interesting to look at.
Get a capture card! The AVerMedia AVerCapture HD that you linked is along the lines of what you want, but it's not my top recommendation.  Take a look at the Elgato HD60 S, a low latency USB 3.0 HDMI capture card (should work just fine with your laptop's USB 3.0 ports.) It's not exactly cheap by any means at $180, but it's the best I know of.  You should then be able to monitor the capture card's video using either Elgato's provided software or something like VLC or OBS.
TL;DR: the Dell P2415Q  Given the target of a 24" 4K monitor, we're basically left with two options: the LG 24UD58-B and the Dell P2415Q.  Both use the same IPS panel manufactured by LG; the differences are in out-of-the-box calibration (Dell has a better reputation and provides statistics in the box for each monitor), connectivity (the 24UD58-B has 1x DisplayPort and 2x HDMI while the P2415Q has 3x DisplayPort, 1x HDMI, and 1x Mini DisplayPort), and Freesync (only the 24UD58-B has Freesync.)  Because you don't game on an AMD card at the moment, and live in Australia where availability of the 24UD58-B is quite poor (I couldn't find any listings at the moment), this leaves the P2415Q, which just squeaks in under the budget at $585 AUD.  Here's a full review of the monitor. Pros are excellent calibration, good contrast (for an LCD), good pixel response times, and of course, 4K. Weaknesses were confined to a too-narrow color space and a heavily matte finish.
You might want to consider a windows tablet, or an aftermarket version of the android os if reliability is a concern. Stock android is susceptable to android bloat, faulty updates and the like.  A panasonic toughpad might be something to look at, though it's definitely at the higher end of the spectrum.
That's a leaked capacitor, you could repair it yourself if you are comfortable with that, but hiring a repairman might be more expensie than a new card. Atleast if you're in the usa where labor is more expensive than parts.  I'll post some resources for a diy repair tomorrow, it"s a cheap project to try with a card that isn't going to get any less dead otherwise.  http://www.overclockers.com/how-anyone-can-replace-leaking-capacitors/ Here's a quick guide. If you damage the board some solder over the traces should be enough to fix 'er.  As jmy1000 mentioned, if she's under warranty I'd recommend going that route if possible.
TL;DR: Wait a little while.  First, let's be clear: there are two tightly connected but separate vulnerabilities here. Meltdown is specific to Intel CPUs since 1995 and has already been patched on all three major OSs, while Spectre is present on almost all x86 chips (AMD and Intel) and ARM chips. Though I won't go too in depth, as of yet there is no universal solution, hardware or software, that universally patches Spectre. I strongly recommend reading this briefing andâ€“if you have at least some background in CS/are willing to spend a lot of time learning about the low level architectureâ€“the Project Zero blog and whitepapers released by the researching groups.  Regarding Meltdown: I've seen those numbers andâ€“while I don't doubt there will be a performance hitâ€“I'm dubious. Be very wary of any answers you recieve here, including my own (I have a limited background in CS, but I haven't come close to fully digesting all the information out there.) Because of the nature of Meltdown's attack vector and subsequent patch, the performance hit is hardest in syscall heavy workloads, but is implementation and workload dependent. I'm going to refrain from quoting any hard numbers simply because of the quantity of numbers out there (Google "meltdown performance" and you'll see workloads ranging from SQL performance within a Linux guest OS on a type-1 hypervisor to Windows Unigine Superposition benchmarks), but I'd expect these numbers to go down over the course of the coming weeks/months. Where this ends is just too difficult to say right now.
I use an old HP MFP1212 LaserJet.  It scans to my 3 MacAirs, my Win10 desktop (or via any of them them to a Synology NAS). Pretty much bullet proof, though you can expect the auto sheet-feeder input to give up the ghost after feeding many thousand sheets.  (I also have an Epson hi-res scanner which, frankly, I don't use: my Synology NAS is only 3 TB in RAID-1 and the Epson can eat that with alarmingly few max-res scans).  Chris
If you haven't rejected the option of using a Raspberry Pi with pi-cam as a system, you'd be getting all of your required features, plus remote access, as the pi could be configured to display the images when polled by a web browser. I'm using Octoprint on my 3D printer, but use an ordinary web cam attached to the Pi. I am able to view images via web browser from the web cam, and I know that a pi-cam would provide the same capability.  A quick check on the pi-cam shows that good focus has been accomplished as low as 30 mm with the V2 NoIR camera module. There are many specifications for both versions of cameras here: Raspberry Pi Camera Specifications  There are tons of resources (kilograms?) for configuring a Pi with an operating system of choice, and almost as many for configuring the camera and accessory software. It's clearly not possible to list them all buy I've picked a couple in the links to show some appropriate representative resources.
Intel does not have a released processor that is unaffected by meltdown. AMD claims that it is unaffected by meltdown.   However, benchmarks have been released by numerous sites and the real world implications of the software patch aren't really that concerning to the average user. For example, looking at the benchmarks from techspot they found that the performance decrease in games range from 0% to 4%, while some things like blender and excel were unaffected by it.   The big performance hit is if you do continuous writes at 512K and lower with an ssd which gives you up to a 40% performance hit, while reads slowed down by up to 17%.  If you are using your computer normally without expecting to heavily read and write files like hosting a database, then you won't notice a significant performance decrease. Even if you wait a little bit it will take time, perhaps over a year, before companies solve this problem on a hardware level and then tool machines to produce them. If you want to avoid the meltdown patch you can get an AMD processor and not patch your windows computer, however you should wait a bit to see if AMD's claims are true.
The simple solution was to go out and buy a cheap webcam (cheaper than PiCam without the Pi): the image is severely unfocussed but perfectly good enough to know the status of each LED (but not wide-angle enough to capture the non-critical "pump on" LED). The image is also mirror-image (took me a while to work out why), but I guess that will sort itself out if I video-chat to my mac from another machine.  As a newbie to Pi there is no way I could implement PiCam within the time my wife will accept all the file boxes strewn around the place, but it is a fascinating project that I will pursue. I've known about Pi since its early days but never bumbled into a use for it until now. Thanks fred_dot_u for the suggestion.
Visit http://netatmo.com I love their "weather" station (I have 5 independent "weather" stations with a total of 13 additional add-on indoor modules - never even the smallest hiccup with any of them).   I also have their "Presence" external camera at one site. It is mains powered & WiFi (only 2.4GHz) and when it works, it works wonderfully (HD, night IR, car/person/animal "event" detection (with auto-floodlight by event category if you wish, with alerts to your mobile by event category if you wish), no monthly fees, iOS, macOS, Android apps (probably Win too but I don't use it). Whack in a big SD card and you're fine...  BUT  ...no way is it $50  ...it is not hiccup free. I have had to invoke intervention from their support folk twice (f/w upgrade issues) but they managed to get everything working remotely (site is 3 hour round trip away, so I can't get involved with hiccups)  They also do internal cams that are closer to your $50 - I have never used them so cannot comment. Chris  Don't worry about the "weather" quote marks: I use their stuff for monitoring internal and external temperatures, not trying to predict weather (and the camera for monitoring snowfall in the mountains)
If you're worried about Meltdown (the easier of the two vulnerabilities to exploit), buy anything AMD.  Meltdown is an Intel-only issue.  If you want to avoid both, you've got very few options.  About the only consumer-level CPUs that aren't vulnerable to Spectre are the "Bonnell"-series Intel Atom CPUs and the lower-end ARM CPUs.  If you want to buy something pre-assembled, you're pretty much stuck with a first-generation Chromebook off Ebay: the Google CR-48, Samsung Series 5, or Acer AC700.  Personally, I recommend waiting.
Your question is about "kind of device", and for that the answer is any SIP phone.  SIP is a protocol/standard and every service or device that comply with these standards are usually compatible.  There are two types of SIP phones you can use.   a SIP desk phone with an LCD display and all kind of physical keys for the options.  a SIP ATA adapter, which lets you configure it with a SIP service and connect to it an old style phone.   For the first type I'd personally say the Yealink SIP-T46S is a great option (make sure to buy a power adapter if you do not have PoE ethernet.) And for the 2nd type something like the Obihai OBi200 (works also with Google Voice) or the Cisco SPA112.
After discussion in the comments and some researching, it looks like the best solution is going to be simply expanding my data package to account for wi-fi tethering, and combining that with a simple tablet or other device. I'm actually looking into building my own to make sure I get the power and features I want.  So the solution, in a nutshell:   Upgraded data package from my phone provider, for tethering Home-brewed lightweight device based on a single-board computer (SBD) that can simply be built with everything I need as far as ports, peripherals, screen, etc. VPN to keep traffic secured
According to this Wikipedia article, the external GPU will be connected by carrying the PCIe bus signals over a Thunderbolt connection, at the speed of upto PCIe x4 rather than x16. Now, for many general-purpose computing applications, the PCIe bandwidth is already a bottleneck at x16 (16 GB/sec theoretical, 12 GB/sec actual), so reducing that by a factor of 4 would be terrible. If, however, you have a lot of computation to do on every piece of data, this should be possible. (I'm not being definitive since I haven't tried this myself).  It's likely, however, that the whole exercise is not worth it, and you should just get a small-form-factor PC which fits a full size GPU (here are a few of them, in a roundup from April 2017).
Don't waste your time with an eGPU, it'll just be slower and more annoying than putting a GPU on a separate machine. If you want that one to be small, that's doable. See my similar answer here for a bit more of an explanation.
Asus Tinker Board     Thin overall architecture - I'm thinking about 1/2" thick at most, and less is better      Around 1.2GHz processor or better - I want it to be able to run a light GUI with good responsiveness, not having to constantly wait for input to get recognized      2GB of RAM would be great, obviously more is better      Micro SD slot for OS (onboard memory for the OS would be fine too, as long as I can expand it with a card)      Ability to attach a simple touchscreen - I can flex on this, if it can run a screen but can't do touch then I'll deal with it      At least one free micro USB port - I'm flexible on power options, as long as it can be charging/powered while having a free port      Built-in wifi (preferably also Bluetooth)      HDMI-out would be a bonus but isn't required      Low-budget is preferred since I'll be building a lot of it myself, but I'm willing to spend a couple hundred if something really fits the bill   Tinker Board has    1.8Ghz Quad Core CPU 2GB DDR3 RAM DSI MIPI connection for a display Micro USB for power SD 3.0 microSD card slot Built in WiFi (and Bluetooth) HDMI Priced around $60 on Amazon   I can't find the size specs, but a closer look at the links might tell you that.  As mentioned in the comments, the USB ports and and such could be de-soldered without issue to give you that slim profile you are looking for.  Other options to look at would be the Orange Pi models, depending on your specific use.
There is obviously no definite answer. But in my opinion, if you can afford it you should certainly take the better one.  The difference between the processors is not a small one but a huge difference in performance (mainly in multi-core workloads) between this 7th gen dual-core i5 and the 8th gen quad-core i7.   In CPU Benchmarks it just blows it away with a score of 8109 to the i5s 4665. (I know benchmarks aren't showing the whole picture, but it shows you something.)  Also, the GPU is somewhat better in the more expensive one.
TL;DR: Buy another RMT3170EB68E9W.  Understanding memory  First things first: let's read what Lenovo specifies as compatible standard memory:     DDR3-1600/1333MHz SODIMM Ã— 2 (max 16 GB)   Time to break it down! Let's start with the hard and fast requirements, then get to the more difficult stuff:  DDR3  DDR stands for "double data rate", a type of  synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM),  with the three indicating that it's the third of four major, incompatible1, revisions of the specification. There's a lot of implications that come as a result of this, but you really only need to keep one in mind: buy DDR3, anything else will not work.  Sidenote: the "double data rate" is where the 800 MHz DRAM frequency becomes 1600 MHz, since 800x2=1600. This is not the same as memory channels.  SO-DIMM  SO-DIMM, or "small outline dual in-line memory module", simply refers to the smaller size of the memory compared to their "normal" desktop DIMM counterparts. DDR3 SO-DIMMS have 204 pins. You will need a SO-DIMM module to work in your laptop. Though DIMMs and SO-DIMMs are electrically compatible (there are even adapters from SO-DIMM to DIMM), trying to squeeze a full sized DIMM into your laptop lies somewhere between absurd and impossible.  Voltages  DDR3 offers three2 different voltages that modules can operate at:        DDR3 or PC3 is the Standard Voltage memory module that operates at    1.50V   DDR3L or PC3L is the Low Voltage memory module that operates at 1.35V    DDR3U or PC3U is the Ultra Low Voltage memory module that operates at    1.25V      Your motherboard specifies the standard voltage DDR3; I'd recommend buying normal DDR3. Most DDR3L/DDR3U can operate at the higher 1.50V (check the spec sheet first though), but you'll be paying a premium for a feature you won't be using.  Speed  Memory speed is like the water speed in a pipe: the faster, the more throughput, the better. There's a decent amount of nuance to this, but basically, get whatever's cheapest. RAM speed (for most workloads) doesn't make enough of an impact to justify the additional price that comes with faster memory. Faster RAM can usually run slower, so don't worry about that.  Channels  The idea here is pretty simple: channels act as an exact multiplier for bandwidth! Imagine having one pipe versus two pipes. This tends to make a larger performance impact than speed (especially since the change in bandwidth is so much higher.) I'd recommend running your memory in dual channel; that is, having two compatible sticks. (This last bit is important; we'll come back to it.)  Timings  Timings refer to a grouping of specifications that relate to the the latency within a module of memory. This gets fairly technical fairly fast, but the general principle is lower is better, but it basically doesn't matter.  Recommendation  Phew, that's a lot to digest!  Since you've already got a 4GB module, it makes sense IMO to get another 4GB module. No problem then: find the cheapest DDR3 SO-DIMM, and away! Right?  No. Remember memory channels? You've only got two slots in your computer, so you have to run in dual channel (plus extra bandwidth!) The problem arises in that memory in the same channel may not play nice without the same speed and timings, and often even same type. While there's no hard-and-fast rule on this, you may experience some stability issues if you mix-and-match.3  In any case, your stick is common enough that it's not too much more expensive to just grab the same stick. For $25, I think it's worth it.  A final word though: your laptop does support 16GB of RAM. If you decide to upgrade to that in the future, get a 2x8GB kit.  Footnotes   There are a few very select exceptions to this rule. There is some limited interoperability between DDR3/DDR4 and Skylake/Kaby Lake, and some DDR2/DDR3 interoperability on select LGA 775 platforms, but these are unusual exceptions. There's also LPDDR3 (different from DDR3L!), which draws even less power. However, these chips must be directly soldered to the motherboard (like in the MacBook Air.) If I'm reading your question correctly, you're mixing and matching right now; however, I'm going to recommend you refrain from that anyways.
Asus PRIME X399-A  This does support RAID 0,1, and 10 However RAID 1 is kind pointless especially if you use SSD.  Right from the manual    And it supports 2 ssd of the m.2 variety.    You can put any size card in an x16 slot.  However, note 2 of the x16 slots operate in x8 mode, but that is still more than x4 card needs.  Lets forget the RAID at least for speed. The M.2 SSD can clobber any expensive raid. https://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?A=details&O=&Q=&ap=y&c3api=1876%2C%7Bcreative%7D%2C%7Bkeyword%7D&gclid=Cj0KCQiAv_HSBRCkARIsAGaSsrBf8KGzl6AJd8odxhLmOkT4PiP4B0gpyKEU5EvVg36xr7F-HVn733caAuGDEALw_wcB&is=REG&m=Y&sku=1288028  Sequential Read Speed   Up to 3,500 MB/s Sequential Write Speed  Up to 2,100 MB/s   It will take 10 extremely fast hard drives to even match the write speed.  This is about equivalent to 4-7 regular SSD.
TL;DR: Option 3 (way down at the bottom) with a Node 202    Because upgradability and the experience with your son seem to be important to you, I'm going to rule laptops, NUCs, and other prebuilt solutions out of hand. To be clear, this isn't to say that a laptop + evideo card or something along those lines would be a particular poor solution in terms of the end productâ€“I might even argue betterâ€“but it seems to conflict with your mission.  With that in mind, it's time to build a SFF PC!  Point-by-point   Your $400-600 budget is plenty to build even a complete machine, so I'll focus on a few options: 1. Kitting out the build with great, new components and a focus on an immediate future upgrade. 2. A solid new platform with money left in the budget to be spent in the future on big upgrades. 3. A "game-now" system using used components to maximize performance on a budget. Linux support is virtually universal these days. I won't be focusing on building a computer that's open from top to bottom (if you want to avoid the IME/TPM check out this post, and read up on Coreboot/Libreboot), as it's both difficult and not really the focus of this question. Every system here will boot from day 1. Performance will obviously be the best with the 3rd option. We'll come back to this. They'll all be small. We'll come back to this a bit more laterâ€“there's plenty of reasons to go either AMD or Intel, and I'll only focus on performanceâ€“but Meltdown and Spectre specifically won't be discussed. While numbers are still coming out and nothing is final, Meltdown's hit appears to be fairly minor in gamingâ€“syscalls is where it hits the worst. Spectre is pretty much architecture aignostic (present on both AMD and Intel chips as well as ARM) with no clear fix, so nothing can really be done there. We'll come back to this more later. Low power is dependent on what you throw in there, and yes, does slightly clash with light gaming. Quiet is more dependent on form factor. We'll touch on this again more. Most computer components these days do quite well on quality. The only places we'll really be concerned with this are the case and used components. Peripherals will be covered separately.   Case  The thing about a case is that it's ultimately a matter of taste, and I can't decide that for you. With that, I'm going to provide a range of good cases and let you choose what you like.  That said, I'm going to recommend the Node 202 on personal preference.  Very small cases  These cases are generally described as "artisan": made by specialized companies in low volumes, with extremely good build quality, at extremely high prices.  Dr. Zaber Sentry  $235 (TBD), 6.9L, 305mm video card, 5x2.5", SFX-L PSU    It's the epitome of a very small case: extremely expensive, extremely tiny, extremely good build quality (primaily powder coated steel), pretty good compatibility with a few things to keep in mind, and runs a bit hot, but generally extremely good. One big issue though: you can't buy one. They're apparently targeting Q1 2018, but for now, I can't recommend what you can't buy.  NFC Skyreach 4 MINI  $199, 5.0L, 215mm video card, 2x2.5", special  It's the smallest case in this category, but with that come some serious compromises. video card compatibility is very limited, drive mounting is limited, and most of all, PSU compatibility is virtually nil, with only two PSUs listed: a $95 400W DC-DC and a $58 200W DC-DC. If you really value space, this is the way to go; but otherwise, I'd stay away.    DAN A4-SFX  $255 (TBD), 7.2L, 295mm video card, 3x2.5", SFX-L    You like shoeboxes? I like shoeboxes! Made under contract by Lian-Li of mostly aluminum, it's (IMO) the prettiest case on this list. But again, it's not for sale yet (just preorders), and I can't recommend what you can't buy.  Pretty small cases  These cases are a step up in size from the very small cases, and benefits to match. These are largely cheaper, easier to work with, have better support, and are actually available to purchase!  NCASE M1  $195, 12.6L, 317mm video card, 3x3.5" + 3x2.5", ATX (SFX-L highly recommended)   The sort of "daddy" of small cases, the NCASE M1 is the last artisan case on this list, and one of the older ones here. It has incredible support for hardware (even a slimline optical drive!), while being spacious enough to keep things from getting too toasty.  Fractal Design Node 202  $80 or $130 with a 450W PSU, 10.2L, 310mm video card, 2x2.5", SFX-L  It's an extremely popular choice, and a good one! Nothing stands out really except for the very reasonable price.  Silverstone FTZ01 RVZ01, RVZ02, and RVZ03  $85 to $130, 14L, 330mm video card, 1x3.5" + 2-4x2.5", SFX-L  All very similar with nothing too stand out; the RVZ03 trades the slimline optical slot and 3.5" mount for an extra 4x2.5" mount and RGB lighting.       Silverstone ML08  $70, 12L, 330mm video card, 2x2.5", SFX-L    It's literally based on the RVZ02, but smaller, cheaper, less drive mounting, and with an optional handle!  Honorable mention  The Silverstone SG05 and Silverstone SG06 are neat, but the 250mm video card support kills my recommendation. The Fractal Design Array R2, Lian-Li Q09, Raidmax Element, SilverStone SG07 and SG08, and Xigmatek Eris EN6305 are no longer in production, though they would make perfectly good boxes if you can find them.  Not as small cases  They're bigger with support for more things! They're also much quieter. Carrying handles are a must here, since you said that regular transport was an integral part to this build. These cases seem to have largely fallen out of favor as smaller cases take over the mITX sector, but I've put them here anyways.  BitFenix Prodigy  $60, 26.4L, 317mm video card, 5x3.5", ATX   HardwareCanucks put it best: It's a beautiful chassis at a great price with a few minor compromises for that goal.  Honorable mentions  The Corsair 380T is a great case, but unfortunately, it no longer appears to be in production, and second hand prices for it are absurd. The Silverstone CS01B is also rather neat, but the 190mm max video card length kills any recommendation. The Cougar QBX and Fractal Design Define Nano S are beautiful and compact, but too large to not have a carrying handle and still be intended as portable IMO.  Components  I'll be leaving out case recommendations from these options; choose whatever you think is best. If you end up needing an SFX PSU, use this list and get whatever wattage you need; if you need an ATX PSU, use this list. CPU cooler is likewise dependent on case selection, but I'll be using the stock cooler as reference, or the Cryorig C7 when not applicable. I'm allocating about $130 to these parts from the rest of these builds.  Final thoughts: I would personally go with option #3. Used components are a great way to get value on a budget.  AMD vs. Intel  To keep things simple, right now, on a $/performance basis, on the middle-high end, AMD wins in heavily multithreaded workloads, and Intel wins in single threaded workloads. Intel also wins in power consumption (though most of that will ultimately come from the GPU.) Given that gaming appears to be your intended use case, I'd recommend Intel. That said, I'm going to provide AMD builds as an option anyways.  Looks  Because this is likely going to be stuffed in a small case, I didn't bother concerning myself with looks at all. That said, if you do decide this is something important, you can of course tune the parametric filters to have the colors of your choice, and get a heatspreader if the M.2 drive is ugly.  Option 1  Great, new components and a focus on an immediate future upgrade.  Intel List     The CPU is a fairly obvious choice here: the i3-8350K offers fast 4c/4t unlocked for a great price. While Z370 is a tad expensive right now, it offers room to upgrade up to 6c/12t in the future. Because there's no stock cooler, the Cryorig C7 stands in. As I said before, this will depend on case selection. Since we've got an unlocked processor, we'll want a Z series board. Wi-Fi is nice while on the go, and not much more expensive, so with a little parametric filtering, we arrive that the ASRock Z370M-ITX/ac. RAM here is a bit funny. Normally I recommend "get whatever's cheapest!", as RAM speed (for most workloads) doesn't make enough of an impact to justify the additional price that comes with faster memory. However, because we'll be relying on integrated graphics for a little while, I decided the fairly low bump to 2666 was worth it. The 850 EVO is fairly fast, and quite good value. I chose an M.2 drive as minimizing the number of cables you have to deal with in a small form factor PC is really quite nice. You're paying a bit of a premium (roughly $20), but I think it's worth it. If you don't care, feel free to step down to a SATA drive.   AMD List     RAM and storage remain the same as the Intel build. Ryzen's performance scales about as you'd expect as you head up the line. Though Ryzen 3s are also quad cores (even with higher clocks!), because of the CCX layout, the 1400 slots into the stack about where you'd expect. It's not beating an i3-8350K, but heyâ€“it's Ryzen. Options for AM4 ITX boardsâ€“even compared to the limited options on Z370â€“are pretty sparse. Limiting it to ITX with Wi-Fi squeezed it down to a total of three boards. I picked the cheapest from thereâ€“however, I'm not a big fan of Gigabyte. Their products are perfectly good, but their support is awfulâ€“it took me about a year to get an RMA from them. If you're willing to do the extra $20, I'd get the ASRock AB350 Gaming-ITX/ac. Ryzen unfortunately lacks integrated graphics. This means we're stuck buying a GPU we don't really want, which with our budget, basically leaves the GT 1030. Don't get me wrong, it's a card with a place (read: low wattage)â€“but spending $75 on one isn't a great use of money IMO. I'd rather get a used card, like the HD 7870 for around $68, or even a GTX 460 for around $25..   Option 2.  A new platform with money left in the budget to be spent in the future on big upgrades  Intel List  Intel unfortunately just doesn't have a CPU in the Coffee Lake lineup at this price point, so no build from them there. I'm not going to recommend last-gen hardware in a build for which upgradability is the main selling point either.  AMD List     The CPU has been stepped down to a 4c/4t Bulldozer APU. It's not going to provide amazing performance, but it'll do, and we can keep our board around for an upgrade. The board needs to support integrated graphics as well now, but we ended up with the same board anyways. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯  Memory remains the same I've stepped the storage down to a 1TB hybrid drive. It's not perfect, but it'll do for a while, and make for a great secondary drive in the future after upgrading to a pure SSD for the boot drive.   Option 3.  A "game-now" system using used components to maximize performance on a budget.  Intel List  Okay, there's no neat PCPartPicker list for this, but that's what happens with used components.   CPU | Intel X3440 Quad Core 2.53GHz LGA 1156 | $16   It's an overclockable 4c/8t for $16. What more can you want? Well, SATA 3 supportâ€“but this isn't going to bottleneck except in sequential reads, and even then, it won't be too bad.  Motherboard | Gigabyte GA-H55N-USB3 | $80   It's not the easiest to find, but it appears to be the only ITX board with eSATA, Wi-Fi, and (most importantly) USB 3.0.    Alternatively, if you've having difficulty finding that motherboard...   CPU | Intel i5-2500k Quad Core 3.30GHz LGA 1155 | $60   Unlocked 4c/4t for a good price  Motherboard | One of these | $110   Again, rather hard to find, but worth it if you can.    And if you're still having trouble...   CPU | Intel i5-4670k Quad Core LGA 1150 | $130   Another unlocked 4c/4t, just more expensive. At this point it's not much cheaper than an i3-8350k, but you'll save a bit on platform cost.  Motherboard | One of these | $80   There's significantly better availability for mITX 1150 boards, so I'd have no worries about finding one of these  CPU Cooler | Cryorig C7 | $30   Same reasoning as before.  Memory | 2x8GB DDR3 | $90   It's still much lower than DDR4 prices, but the RAM shortages have tricked down to last gen as well. Again, speed isn't a big factor hereâ€“especially since we won't be using integrated graphics. Depending, you may find it worth stepping down to 8GB of DDR3 in order to get a component you wantâ€“likely a GPU.  Storage | Samsung 850 EVO-Series 250GB SSD | $90   We'll stick with the 850 EVO from earlier for the same reasons, though we'll need to use a 2.5" SATA drive rather than M.2 (unless you manage to get one of the five Z97 boards on the list that have an M.2 slot.)  GPU | Reference GTX 970 4GB | $190   Because we'll be installing the card in a small form factor case, we'll want a blower-style GPU to keep from dumping hot air back into the case. Unfortunately, the GTX 970 is pretty much the cap for budgetâ€“stepping this up to from a GTX 960 4GB is about $60. One of the issues here is that power consumption really does start to play a roleâ€“not just because we want to keep out system cool and quiet, but because high-wattage SFX PSUs are expensive. This rules out older cards like the GTX 780 and AMD cards from the era. Mid and high end cards are sold out across the board, thanks to mining and the subsequent card shortages; your only other option is really to watch for stock like a hawk and hope that a GTX 1060 is in stock. Depending on what deals you find, you may be forced down either to a GTX 960 or 8GB of RAM.    TOTAL: $496-$565  The savings aren't as much with mITX systems as full towers, but it's still a good chunk of change for significantly better performance.  AMD List  AMD's older offerings just simply aren't competitive, and stock is much lower to boot.  Peripherals  I'm too tired to go into this in too much depthâ€“and I think it might warrant its own questionâ€“but the Roccat Sova MK for M/KB, and a PS4/Xbox One controller if you want a controller.    I think that's about it! I hope this helped, and I'll be happy to answer any questions you have.

The Samsung NX 300 can upload pictures to Facebook after you configure Wi-Fi, and presumably your Facebook username/password.   Picture from https://globalnews.ca/news/785601/how-to-pick-the-right-wifi-digital-camera/  This article talks about similar features in Canon and Nikon cameras, as well as in other Samsung models such as the affordable ST150F.
The Raspberry Pi Zero W  It's $10, comes with Bluetooth LE and Wi-Fi onboard, and can be very easily set for use with an I2C sensor. Under full load it draws a only 1.2W, but has enough horses to keep pace. Best of all, it has a massive community backing it, including a StackExchange community!  The biggest drawback comes in the niche I/O choices compared to a larger boardâ€“unless you're a camera or tech geek, chances are you don't have a mini HDMI port, and you'll need to provide your own micro SD card. That said, it has a bounty compared to other similar boards like the Beetle LE or BLE Nano, and you'll probably find it easier to work with as a result.
TL;DR: Whatever "knockoff" keyboard is cheap this week.  Based on the fact that your previous board was a full sized keyboard, I'm going to assume you want something similarly sized. Tenkeyless keyboards tend to be slightly cheaper, so if you're fine with one of those, I'd recommend taking a look.  Switches  You noted you liked the Cherry MX Blue switches on your board. Thanks to the large and growing mechanical keyboard "fandom", a number of other companies have started manufacturing similarly colored, similarly feeling switches. Gateron (rather loud), Kailh (slightly loud and stiff), Outemu (rather loud), and Greetech (slightly loud) come to mind. You're not getting the quite same QC as Cherry, but you're getting a much better price. I personally spent a while with this Outemu equipped board and quite liked itâ€“even in comparison to my Cherry MX Brown equipped board.  Boards  Some fairly reputable manufacturers like DasKeyboard and Razer have switched to using these switchesâ€“however, their boards remain as expensive as genuine Cherry switches.  For the most part, you'll be looking at boards from "second tier" manufactuers like EagleTec, E-Element, RedDragon, and AUKEY. You'll notice that I didn't actually give a specific recommendation. That's becauseâ€“for much as I love roundups like theseâ€“they're just not really a good comparison here. Most of these keyboards aren't actually made by the companies selling them, but are rather made by OEMs like Easterntimes and resold with minor/no changes. This means there's a wealth of virtually-identical keyboards with various prices. The best strategy is pretty much to look and see whatever's cheapest on sites like /r/hardwareswap, then go from there. Right now, this Eagletec board or this AUKEY keyboard, both for $36.99, look like good choices.  But Cherry!  Okay, Cherry is the standard for a reason. If you decide you want a Cherry-equipeed board, I'd recommend Cooler Master MasterKeys L PBT: at $61.07 (right now, MSRP $89.99, and often on similar sale), it's pretty hard to beat. I personally own the similar MasterKeys Pro L White LEDs, and quite enjoy it: it's well build with great double shot keycaps, programmable, and with pretty great support for custom cases and keycaps thanks to the standard PCB layout and included keycap puller.
Lineage OS has been ported to the AGM A8 rugged phone which goes for around 160 USD.  http://www.agmmobile.com/en/news/now-AGM-A8-gets-Lineage-OS
I'll open by saying I am not an authority on VR tech nor do I follow the scene as a hobby. I own an HTC Vive and have used a Rift once or twice.     TL;DR: I love my Vive, I'd spend the money above the Rift to get it, but that's not the right choice for everyone. Promising tech is on the horizon. Promising options on both the lower and higher budget ends outside of the Rift and Vive.   Oculus Rift:  Pro:   Cheapest by a mile (unless you also consider the newer WMR devices) Same resolution as Vive (1080 x 1200 per eye) Lighter, more ergonomic controllers Many say it is more comfortable than the Vive, I'd say it is about the same. Head shape will be the main factor here so try both if you can. Perfectly acceptable tracking Out-of-the-box integrated headphones More space for googly eyes on the front without disturbing tracking   Con:   Not set up for room-scale tracking out of the box (1-2 addtl tracker(s) needed @ $60 each depending on shape of your game area) Smaller theoretical supported roomscale area size Lower FOV than Vive (100 vs 110) Closed game ecosystem; there are very easy workarounds but it is an extra step Imperceptibly lower PPI than Vive Smaller accessory market (but they are there!) (Obviously subjective) Owned by Facebook No front camera Uses a ton of USB ports (one for headset, one for each tracking cam) Shorter cable than Vive (4m vs 5m (+1 from link box))   HTC Vive:  Pro:   Same Resolution as Rift (1080 x 1200 per eye) Imperceptibly higher PPI Higher FOV than Rift (110 vs 100) Front camera Fewer ports on PC needed (just HDMI/DP and one USB) Open game ecosystem (can play Rift games with one addtl step [ReVive]) Longer cable than Rift (5m (+1 from link box) vs 4m) Best tracking in the industry using Lighthouses which only need to be supplied power, not connected to PC in any way Richer accessory market (forehead fans, upgraded face pads like leather and velour, Deluxe Audio Strap, Vive Trackers to add more objects in VR, etc) Larger supported room-scale area (v1 Lighthouses can do 20' x 20' without significant loss in tracking. v2 purported to be capable of 30' x 30')   Con:   Twice the price of Rift (gap narrows as Rift is set up for room-scale) Heavier headset and controllers (I personally like the bulkier controllers, they add a sense of presence for whatever you are holding in game) $100 Deluxe Audio Strap to get comparable integrated headphones as those that come with Rift (could be seen as a positive if you have nice headphones you wanted to use anyway, there is a 3.5mm jack right on the headset you can hook into) (Subjective) Less comfortable than Rift although both have a wide range of face pads to suit your needs. Must be careful where googly eyes are placed to avoid disturbing tracking   Additional Vive Info:  HTC recently announced their Vive Pro which introduces a number of feature additions and upgrades:   OOTB integrated headphones More ergonomic head mounting solution 78% higher resolution (about 32% increased PPI) Gen 2 wands Gen 2 lighthouses Dual front cameras (dont worry, plenty of room for googly eyes)   HMD-only (upgrade your current Vive kit, rumors of a trade-in program) scheduled for Q1 2018 (next 2 months or so) and the full kit scheduled for a Q3 release. Prices not yet confirmed.  PIMAX:  I'll be honest on this one, I haven't looked terribly hard into it. I try not to get too invested in a product until I see a consumer-ready version and with Pimax they are 100% not ready for consumers. I've heard the bump in resolution (which is certainly not 8k, it is 4k for each eye which is half as many pixels as 8k) is something to behold.  I've seen a few Pimax videos and right now it sounds like the consensus is that the 200 FOV is incredible, the resolution is incredible, but the tracking is still far behind its contemporaries, and price is yet to be confirmed. Hopefully someone who follows this story closer can correct me here.  I personally won't bother considering the Pimax until it has been in consumer rotation for a little while, but do some research as the tech is pretty impressive. And you can look like a bug person.  Windows Mixed Reality (WMR):  Another category I don't have much experience with but from what I have read this market segment is very promising. Compared to the Rift and Vive, most of these headsets are very affordable and boast a higher resolution and PPI. I'm not sure how broad the game support is but I know people have played some popular Vive games without much issue at all.  One of the biggest pros for the WMR headsets is their "plug-in-and-go" style of inside-out tracking. This means that there are no external tracking devices that must be arranged in/around your play area. The limitations of this are that if your controllers are out of view of the tracking cameras on the headset they can still be tracked but only using the accelerometer, i.e. they must keep moving to be tracked. I've heard this causes problems in games that use "utility belt" style inventory systems where you otherwise would be able to interact with certain game features more naturally.
LG still sells a 49" model TV, the LG 49UH850V, which is UHD for 949 euro, though it's tempting to get the 55" model for only 45 euro more. There is also the Samsung UE50KU6020WXXN 50" UHD for 579 euro, which does not beat the price of a VR-compatible smartphone with that resolution, but still offers 1080p in 25". I could then buy a new computer desk, or use my wireless keyboard at my dining tables.
It's a toss up between a Radeon RX-460 and a Geforce GTX-750 for me:    Here are a few specific UPCs:  Radeon RX-460: 778656073524  Geforce GTX-750: 843368027933  The RX-460 has DVI and DisplayPort, and there are single-slot models available.  The GTX-750 has both DVI and DisplayPort, and there are single-slot models available.  References   Build Your Own Single-Slot GeForce GTX 750 Ti - Tom's Hardware Comparison table: GTX-750 vs RX-460
TL;DR: The Dell U2718Q    DIY  As big as a fan as I am of DIYing and painting one of your own (maybe with plastidip so it's removable?), on a monitor of this caliber, there's simply too much to risk: masking is simply too difficult and easy to screw up, and disassembly voids the warranty (legality of that aside.)  So, we're left dealing with what exists.  Basic features  At this kind of price point, IPS is a must, and 27" (verus 23.8", which is really the only other size) is (IMO) a pretty clear choice. Right off the bat, that narrows our selection of monitors down pretty far, to roughly 20 or so. From there, it's unfortunately about trade offs.  Since your laptop lacks support for FreeSync or Gsync (and gaming doesn't seem to be a priority anyways), I'm going to prioritize color reproduction in the panel over other features, like refresh rate, frame syncing, input lag, profiles, or inputs.  Physical appearance and stand  Okay, it's the most glaring thing about my choice and probably the hardest part about finding a monitor. Yes, the U2718Q is dark colored. I chose it anyways.  Unfortunately, the number of non-black monitors that fit the above requirements is... 2: the Acer S277HK and the Asus MX27UC. And beautiful though they are, neither feature a high adjustable stand nor support for VESA mounting. Pretty comes at a cost, and not just in the mounting department: while they're not particularly out of the norm, they just don't have as nice panels as the other monitors.  This leaves the U2718Q and two LG brothers (they're pretty much the same monitor): the LG 27MU88 and 27UD88.    And man, is it close.   Both have height adjustable stands with support for VESA mounts. They've both got extremely thin bezels (though the Dell has a noticeably smaller bottom bezel), though the LG has a more silvery stand. They both cover roughly 97% of sRGB, with the Dell supporting software HDR. The LG monitor features USB-C. The LG monitor features FreeSync. The LG monitor has better brightness. The Dell monitor is about $100 cheaper.   Quite frankly, either of these monitors would be valid choices. That said, I'm favoring the Dell because of the significantly lower price, as I don't think the brightness is too big an issue.
TL;DR: The LG 24UD58-B    First, let's figure out what resolution we need to have.  Since pretty everything on the market right now falls into either 1080p/1440p/2160p, we can ignore pretty much all other resolutions (at least for considering what we'll need in terms of resolution.)  Your 14" 1080p laptop gets you of 157.35 PPI. Targeting a standard 23.8" 16:9 monitor, 1440p gets 123.41 PPI and 2160p gets 185.12 PPI. That in mind, you're sort of in a weird middle ground relative to your laptop. I opted to go for a 2160p monitor, but if you're fine with it, a 1440p monitor would be perfectly valid.  That alone gets us down to two monitors: the LG 24UD58-B and the Dell P2415Q. The price difference is pretty negligible, so it's down to picking features.  (LG review, Dell review)   Both are IPS panels (the Dell actually uses the same LG panel) The Dell is slightly brighter The LG offers FreeSync   I'm aware you don't have an AMD GPU, but given the rather negligible difference otherwise, I'm strongly inclined to recommend the LG monitor.
You can't really.  Per the specs page:     Discrete AMD R7 A365 GPU: Permanently soldered to the motherboard and is not in card form factor   There's also no Thunderbolt, so an eGPU using that is out of the question.  The only option left would be to do use one of the PCI-e equipped M.2 slots on the motherboard and some sort of M.2 to PCI-e riser.     However, I would strongly discourage this, as it'll be extremely difficult to actually modify your PC to work as such.

I think you're leaning on the right side and feel that not because it has more physical cores but also it has the more Static ram which makes multi-tasking much smoother.And as you said it has less clock rate but in specs, it also mentioned that you can turbo boost that up to 3.7GHz I fully suggest you on picking 6130 for your server
I have purchased a Grandstream GXP2200 several years ago and am quite happy with it. This is a table-top phone which runs Android and connects to your LAN via Ethernet or Wifi. It supports all common Android features and you can even install apps. The only downside is that they are really slow updating the Android version. Mine has still 2.3, and their current line is on Android 4.2!  But they have a line of cheaper SIP table-top phones which seem to have a different OS. They still have a bunch of nice features (e.g. managing multiple SIP accounts) and they are sold for 25 Euros (GXP1610) to 60 Euros (GXP1630) on Amazon.  http://www.grandstream.com/products/ip-voice-telephony/basic-ip-phones
In case you don't mind paying near to $250 on a fitness watch, you need to check out the Garmin VÃ­voactive 3. This is the best ever I could suggest within your budget and also it has all the features you want like you said above. BUT, if you need to make a second choice, you should consider the Fitbit Ionic.   It is like a straight fight between Pepsi vs Cola, DC vs Marvel, PS4 vs Xbox One, Android vs iOS. So the rival for Garmin is Fitbit. You can take a look at the comparison or read review before making final choice.  Some additional info.  Weight :   Fitbit Ionic = 50 grams (or to be exact = 49.8952 grams)  Garmin Vivoactive 3 = 43 grams  So the winner here is Fitbit Ionic  Battery life  :   Fitbit = 4 days Garmin = 7 days  So the winner here is Garmin VÃ­voactive 3  Software Compatibility and Features :   Garmin - If you are really into fitness freak or maybe something like endurance athletes and detailed performance junkie. This is the best to utilize a lot of activities such as cycling, golf, skiing, sports tracking, etc.   Fitbit - It is preferable for people who desire a less complicated user interface, are keen on daily activity monitoring and get social functions.   Conclusion :   What you stated above "track calories consumed, burnt and also help manage time allotments to various activities like sleep, eating, etc.."  It is all can be done via both fitness tracker, but in term more added function or more details tracking, the winner is Garmin is here. But if you are not really into that, the best is Fitbit Ionic, with great display quality (that is the thing that make the battery duration for the Ionic less than Vivoactive) and less complicated user interface, it could be great for you which is at home the most of the time.  Finally, my guess, the Fitbit Ionic is more suitable for you. For more details specs, i guess you should check out their official website, it might be a very long answer if i need to elaborate all of the details aspects and features.
Although there cannot be a single answer, there are a lot of devices from different gaming manufacturers that meet your criteria, but I will point you to this MSI GT75VR TITAN PRO-215  I think it ticks all the boxes and more benefits:   Has the Nvidia 1080 (the best of the 3) Comes already with a good 64GB or RAM The quad-core i7 is not bad...although you have not mentioned CPU specifically Has a fast SSD for a bonus... but still enough storage in the secondary HDD It comes with Windows 10 (like every recent device...) but there is no reason why you would not be able to install Windows 7 on it. Windows Updates will not work out-of-the-box in Windows 7 (because it is a 7th gen Intel CPU) but you can use something like wufuc to get around it.
The Rosewill RNX-AC1900PCE    I'm guessing based off your post you want an internal adapter, and not a USB one. I'm a little surprised you want one at all given it already has an internal card, but heyâ€“if you want a bit of an upgrade, here's your card.  As @SiXandSeven8ths said, you'll need a card with a low profile bracket. Luckily, almost every card comes with oneâ€“this one included!  Since you're working in a proprietary case and weird PSU, I decided against any cards with an external power connector. I also went with wireless AC, since you seem to be looking for an upgrade. This left the TP-Link Archer T6E AC1300, TRENDnet TEW-807ECH, Asus PCE-AC56, and our Rosewill card all around the same price point. Both the TP-Link and Asus cards seem to have massive compatibility issues with Windows 10 Fall Creator's Update, and the TRENDnet card seems to have some QC issues, leaving the Rosewill card.
I've been looking around a bit, and first one note about the problem with bluetooth quality: The standard only supports either stereo music or mono plus microphone (I think I even found this explained somewhere on http://superuser.com). Anyway, so far I've found the following two candidates, coincidentally all from SteelSeries (no, I am not affiliated, apparently they just are good):   The SteelSeries Siberia 840 can be used both wired (full quality, not using bluetooth) and wireless, has two battery packs for quick exchange and recharge, and additional bluetooth connectivity. Obviously that comes at a price around 300$ The Arcits 3 Bluetooth is probably what you're actually looking for, wired but with bluetooth support, and from its description apparently even working synchronously (I'm not sure if bluetooth still works with wires disconnected, but why else would a battery be included?). At ~150â‚¬ it's also much cheaper than the Siberia 840. Just remember with bluetooth you cannot use the microphone and have stereo quality at the same time (though the description suggests you can listen to stereo quality over wire and use the mono+microphone bluetooth in parallel) The Arctis 7 can be used wired and wireless, but unfortunately it lacks bluetoth. But maybe bluetooth is not what you actually wanted, but rather wireless in general. The disadvantage is it only works via USB in wireless mode
First of all, bluetooth won't provide high quality sound and using the microphone by its standard. From my research I think the SteelSeries Sibera 840 might be a good match, it can be used with most consoles and PCs and includes bluetooth. The catch is it's no earbuds, but then again I doubt you could get proper surround sound from buds...

Definitely the GTX 1080!  I know benchmarks aren't always showing the whole picture but when the benchmarks show 4 times the performance on a card it is obvious which one is better, for any task whatsoever. In Videocard Benchmarks it is a difference between 3376 for the Quadro M2200 and 12185 for the 1080.  While Quadros have some benefits in workstation kind of devices since they are specifically targeted for these kinds of workloads, but not when you compare one of the top latest GTX cards to a mid (if now lower) range and older generation Quadro (you wouldn't even find a lot of "vs." articles online about these two, since the M2200 is compared which much lower-end GTXs.)
So I it baffles me why I haven't been able to find one yet that has great reviews but I found this one online that seems like it should work.  As a working although clunky solution you should be able to use the following USB C Hub and then plug you USB C to 3.5mm adapter into it.  It may depend on your device though ultimately.  The reviews says it works for the Pixel and HTC 10.  This ones was reviews were so bad I don't think it is worth buying.
Found, at last: QNAP TS-453BT3
In Ear  For their price the Apple Airpods ($159) really are at the top of their market segment. You'll get the in-ear design you prefer and 3-5 hours of listening time per charge and another 3-5 hours after placing them in the charging case for just 15 minutes.  Being an iPhone user you also benefit from features that an Android user would not, such as the simple pairing (W2 chip functionality) and, for lack of a better name, the "take one of them out of your ear to pause music" functionality. Because these do not use silicone ear inserts the fit on these will be subject to the shape of your ears. If the earpods that came with your phone fit you well then these will also, the form factor is exactly the same.   The primary competition for this product are going to be the Google Pixelbuds, same price ($159) and battery specs but these are not fully wireless (buds connected to one another by wire) and getting them into and out of the charging case is a little finnicky.  Another notable mention in this price range is the Jaybird Run, at $179.99 retail.  Something different  I've done some window-shopping and although I don't think I'll ever have the cash to splurge on them, the Sennheiser MX-550-X bluetooth headphones are an interesting offering. Although these tout about 8 hours of battery life (charged via micro usb) the fairly unique feature of these are that the battery is replaceable, so theoretically you can have all the nice noise cancelling features and the incredible sound-stage we have come to expect from Sennheiser over-ear headphones, and you can simply carry extra batteries to swap when needed. There's a lot more cool tech on these so if you really are looking for a premier headphone check it out.  All of the headphones above are fully featured for a smartphone and include some form of media control on the headphones physically, as well as a microphone.
Over Ear  I've got the LinkWitz Casque Bluetooth headphones, which are an over-ear pair of wireless headphones with passive noise cancelling and a microphone.    They run on a rechargeable battery (charges via microUSB - comes with a charging cable, though you probably already have one) that I've found lasts about 12-15 hours of regular but intermittent use. I imagine continuous use would see more like 8-10 hours.  The microphone is reasonable quality - it's nestled in among the controls on the left-hand side - good enough for clear voice calls.  The audio quality feels a little distant, slightly lacking in mid-range frequencies, but bass response is excellent and a system equalizer can easily clean up the mid-ranges without much adjustment.  The only issue you may have with them is the earphone size - the inner diameter is just 30mm, so you do need relatively small ears for them to fit comfortably over the top.  Generally, though, they're good headphones. I got mine on sale for around Â£25, but the RRP is around Â£80.
It would be a pulse sensor to read one's pulse rate while exercising by the transmission of ultraviolet light or maybe infrared light through the skin to the receptor on the opposite side. It clips to one's fingertip. As blood flows through the smaller vessels, the light is alternately blocked and allowed to pass, providing appropriate data for the device into which it is connected.
Apparently this CPU is a bad combination with my GPU; I have been told that they will not work together.    That CPU and GPU will work together just fine.  GPU's are designed to be compatible with most CPU architectures, including offerings from Intel and AMD. Ryzen is AMD's new platform, and just like any new release there were some kinks to work out in regard to memory management and driver / system compatibility. Ryzen CPU's have been out for a while, so as far as I know those issues are all resolved. I have several friends and co-workers running Ryzen systems, running a mix of GPU's from both Nvidia and AMD. No major or irregular problems reported.       No overclocking so do I need CPU cooler separate?   You do not need an aftermarket cooler for any Ryzen CPU if you're not overclocking.  Even if you are overclocking, the "Spire" cooler series (which come stock with Ryzen chips) are very good air coolers. I'd recommend you save your cash and use the stock cooler. You can always buy a big fancy one later if you end up wanting to do extreme overclocking down the line.       There will no intense programming or video processing; I will use the PC for some games here and there, but it will only be doing regular "home" tasks everyday.    So I know this part wasn't really a question, but I do have a recommendation or two.  First, the CPU you're getting is probably overkill for  your goals. It offers some future proofing and flexibility, but as @SiXandSeven8ths mentioned already in the comments you'd probably get equivalent use from a Ryzen 5 series unless you're going to be doing VR gaming.  Second, if you do go with the Ryzen 7 1700, get the Ryzen 7 1700x instead. They're the same price, but the 1700x is a better "binned" chip. This means it'll be faster and more stable on average.    www.pcpartpicker.com is a good ressource to use. I've got your build started for you at the following link:  https://pcpartpicker.com/list/gyy23b  Good luck with the build!    Regarding questions from OP's edits:  I like the board in your PCPartPicker list a lot. I've had good experiences with ASUS motherboards and from what I've heard they handled the release of DDR4 and the new socket types with minimal speed bumps.  The CRYORIG C7 cooler will work just fine. It's designed to fit the following sockets according to PCPartPicker:     AM2, AM2+, AM3, AM3+, AM4, FM1, FM2, FM2+, LGA1150, LGA1151, LGA1155, LGA1156   I don't believe it has any LED's, or at least I can't find any pictures or documentation suggesting that it does. Most coolers that do feature LED lighting have them installed directly on the fans, which are replaceable anyhow. I'd say that you've got a green light to go ahead and get the C7, as the worst case scenario is replacing an LED enabled fan with a non-LED fan.  Please let me know if you have additional questions, I'll be happy to follow up. Best of luck with the build!
If you're still looking for recommendations, I'd take a look at the MSI Radeon RX 560 - 1024 4GB AERO video card. If you're still using Manjaro (the best!) then this would be the simplest solution for you. You can use the open-source drivers built into the kernel and get fantastic performance, meaning all you do is put it in your PCIe slot and power it up. It also supports up to 3 displays (it has 1 HDMI, 1 DisplayPort, and 1 DVI-D) and will support up to 4K resolutions.  The nVidia equivalent is the EVGA GTX 1050 which is about $30 or so more. There are 2 main drawbacks with this card. 1) it requires a 6-pin PCIe power connector from your power supply. If you have a prebuilt machine, the OEM power supply might not have one. 2) If you're using nVidia graphics cards on Linux you should be using their proprietary, non-free drivers which you will have to update.  Given those 2 choices, I'd pick the Radeon due to its inherent simplicity. You'll plug it in, power up, and just go.
I ended up buying this Multi Monitor Video Graphics Adapter* which wasn't working either until I disabled secure boot, curious to know if that prevented the other items I tried but I have what I wanted finally.  * StarTech.com HD 1080p USB 3.0 to HDMI External Multi Monitor Video Graphics Adapter for Mac and PC
I think this Acer laptop is worth a look:  https://www.amazon.co.uk/F5-573G-Notebook-NX-GDAEK-003-Dedicated-Graphics/dp/B06XKBCSSJ  Basically ticks all your - very clearly - defined checkboxes. And although Acer is not considered the best manufacturer, being on this budget I don't see anything better for your needs.   15.6" Full HD Screen  List item Intel Core i3-6100 8GB RAM 128G SSD + 1TB HDD Dedicated GeForce GTX 950M 4GB Graphics
You can try Moto E4, It supports all of your requirements. It has removable battery, OTG support, SD Card slot and 2GB RAM/16GB ROM. You can check its complete specs and available sellers list from BuyMyPrice
Part of that which is missing in today's portable communications devices (cellular phones) is a feature of old-time telephones known as sidetone. This is exactly what you describe as feedback. One can hear one's own voice when speaking, with minimal to zero delay. Any appreciable delay becomes comedy material for radio disk jockeys and is riotous.   I did a quick search for "gaming headset with sidetone" and was rewarded with a number of results that would indicate such a product exists. A few clicks in and I discovered that the search results are misleading, as a number of the products did not explicitly state sidetone as a feature.  I also discovered that a few forums have discussions regarding this feature. It is more likely that you would be able to find a product confirmed by a forum user as having that feature, or you may be lucky enough to discover specifications indicating that sidetone or feedback is available.  One post to a forum indicated that windows has the capability to enable the user to select "hear yourself" but I cannot confirm that as I do not have that feature on my system.  The anti-bark collar, while suitable for creating entertaining video, would be providing feedback of limited duration.
It's practical to consider that you need special hardware, if only to have the physical capability to connect twelve screens to a source device. A quick search for "tiling computer image over multiple screens" provided too many links covering two monitor wallpaper, but a couple more useful resources.  One of them is an NVIDIA product line called Mosaic. I expect that the company would be able to provide substantially high performance video devices, considering their history in the gaming video world. I did not follow the pricing links!  Another link I discovered also appears to be a commercial resource, but seems to be a service rather than a solution. One of the links from that source sent me to Matrox which advertises "Dual, Quad and beyond," for capability.  AMD appears to offer support via graphics adapter cards up to six displays.  I popped off another search using "How many monitors will windows support," and got a few links to indicate "no limit," except for hardware limitations and performance consideration. The search also provided an article written in 2012 that might be of value https://www.pcworld.com/article/251521/when_two_monitors_arent_enough.html describing alternative devices, which again is a hardware consideration.  You'll be limited by the number of slots in your computer and the number of ports per card, but if you have sufficient room to plug in four cards with three ports, or the reverse, it is suggested in the articles noted above that you should use all the same device, to keep the drivers uniform.
I found something that may meet your requirements, for a rather good price (US Dollars) in a product called the DATAQ DI-1100 data acquisition starter kit.    Four analog inputs up to +/-10v with provided software allowing for computer data storage and processing. The connections are screw terminals, not mini-plugs, although it's a simple matter to add such a junction device of your own design and construction.  The specifications note that you should be able to accomplish 20-24kHz sampling for the limited number of inputs you require.  There are PDF documents on the site providing greater detail as well as the operation manual. The manual indicates a mini-USB is used for power and communication.  The included software manual has a section allowing for exporting files to be used in Excel, although it references the more-or-less universal CSV file format, precluding the data from being restricted to Excel.
At 9 (I know...it's not 10...) feet the AmazonBasics USB Type-C to USB Type-C 2.0 Cable should be a great option.  officially supports fast charging (and some pixel owners confirm in the Q&As, and has a 5-star rating from Google Engineer and famous USB Type-C reviewer Benson Leung.
Lenovo P2 has ~5000mAh, which can last me over a weekend at a pinch.  This gives it slightly less ability to charge other things than the 6000mAh suggestions, although with the P2 itself appearing to be very power efficient, needing less power itself, the difference might not be so big.
A typical solar panel electrical package will include a series of solar panels (rating and quantity based on expected load), a charge controller, a battery bank (rating and quantity based on expected load) and an inverter (yes, rating based on expected load).  If you are confident that you will need 1000 watts of power, you should be configuring your system for at least twenty percent more than that, as one does not achieve one hundred percent efficiency from solar panels. If one is in an area of less than ideal weather conditions, one should increase the size proportionally. For the sake of this answer, I'll stick with the 1200 watt value.  In the USA, The Home Depot sells a 1200 watt system with 4 panels of 77 inches by 14 inches (1.9m x .35m) which is quite a large array. These panels include micro-inverters, one m-inverter per panel and provide AC voltage directly to the included controller and sub-panel.  This is not the type of system you would want if your intention is to run the computer continuously, but is provided as an example of the size of panels and general configuration.  A company called Armory Survival(!) sells an 1100 watt system, also with 4 panels of similar size, but has an off-grid configuration that permits battery connection. Very expensive bundles that do not include batteries means additional expense to have continuous (night) electrical power.  A frequent discussion in the electric vehicle world is the concept of a motor vehicle powered by solar panels exclusively. It's a different type of portability, but the numbers are equally challenging.  I'm not confident that you'll find a system to meet your requirements, especially considering the balcony constraint. Additionally, if your balcony does not point toward geographic south, the efficiency deteriorates for lack of solar energy.
Just because this thread is one of the top google search results for USB-C 3.1 (and USB-C 3.1 gen 2) splitters/hubs and Thunderbolt hubs I want to provide some products that I had to search for for a long, long time.  As Mumblic pointed out the availability for splitters are somewhat limited. I looked around a bit anyways and found a couple of products (hubs!) that:   Feature Thunderbolt 3 Charging for at least one device Have additional USB ports (C and/or A, at least 3.0) Support at least one 60Hz 4k, mostly 60Hz 5k or 2x 4k Monitors and cost under 350 Bucks (urgh..)   Ordered by price (low => high):   CalDigit TS3 Elgato Thunderbolt 2 Dock OWCTB3 DK13PSG Belkin 3 m Thunderbolt Express Dock    These products are still pretty expensive and for this question searching a USB-C Splitter they may be completely off topic, but given the possibilities they offer I think they may be worth the price.  I have not tested any of this products myself but there are some reviews online.
The CPU of the Dell Inspirion 15 5000 is soldered to the mainboard; however, you can change the board to another (so, you basically change the whole board + cpu).  You can't change only the CPU.  Edit: Also, please note, you never ever can swap an Intel with an AMD processor, since their Socket won't fit.
Qnap will run Plex pretty perfectly -- takes care of the format concerns. The machine itself can transcode on the fly or as a backround task too. Plus DNLA support.  I also am pretty sure Kodi is available through qnapclub.eu Also Sickcbeard and some other fun stuff.   Surveillance station works like a charm but the new QVRpro is pretty sick. You can upload maps and the camera support is easy - as is assigning storage space. What can I say -- I'm a fan with a love/hate relationship with Qnap.   I hate their "tech support". They just yell at you. lol
The Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM is a really good option.  Now on Amazon UK for Â£127.99 https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00PDUE8TG   Charges via typical Micro USB. Has a 3.5mm aux input   But in general, it is a solid good speaker with awesome battery life and great sound.  As for your USB charging question: if it uses the same connection it will usually charge with any such connection if something it just won't charge that fast.
The answer is to call and ask the company that is selling that device. I called and a helpful guy picked up and could directly check whether that particular machine offers hardware virtualization in BIOS and it does, so I think I am going with that. Don't hesitate to call people, you'll likely end up with a good answer much faster.
According to the ThinkPad T470p Platform Specifications document, there are two M.2 slots:   an "M.2 SSD / PCIe NVMe, PCIe 3.0 x 2, 16Gb/s" slot with the comment "System has one HDD slot or one M.2 2280 slot exclusively for storage", and another "128GB M.2 SSD / SATA 6.0Gb/s, in WWAN slot as 2nd Storage, mutually exclusive with WWAN" slot.   So, there is a full M.2 2280 slot (which cannot be used at the same time as the 2.5" SSD/HDD slot, because they occupy the same physical space), which provides a 16Gb/s PCIe 3.0 x2 connection (way faster than a SATA3 with 6Gb/s), and a shorter WWAN M.2 slot, which can be used with smaller (2260) cards, and which provides only SATA connectivity (limited to the standard 6Gb/s speed).
I think the Lenovo is the obvious choice.  For UI/UX design, you don't really need a lot of GPU power. A 940MX is a capable chip that will be sufficient for the job. RAM is much more important. I work with PSD files over 1Gb and that puts a lot on your RAM. 8 is not enough, but 12 will be more comfortable. There is not much of a difference between DDR3 and DDR4.  i7-7500U is a dual-core CPU, but as long as you don't do video editing and 3D graphics, 2 Cores will be just fine (Quad core will be better though). But the thing that I find most conclusive is the SSD. That alone should help you decide. Don't get a PC without an SSD! It's as simple as that.   So to sum things up:   SSD is super important GPU is not a big deal as long as you don't do 3D and video editing A quad-core CPU is always better, but again unless you don't do 3D/video editing, Dual core is enough 8Gb of RAM is not enough, 12Gb is better (RAM is expensive, keep that in mind)   So for me, the choice is obvious. The Lenovo is the better choice.
I have a device connected to my computer which allows me to select between speakers and headphones at the press of a button. I recognize that your request is not quite that configuration, but the circuit involved in this specific device would function in the manner you require if connected "in reverse."  A quick search using the Google for "headphone speaker switch box" has provided the expected multitude of results, for example: Speaker Headphone switch  I would not recommend this linked item, however, as it contains a volume control. There's no way to determine if any polarity protection is built into such a circuit, although it is unlikely.   The box I use is only a switch, the electrons flow in either direction with no problem. It has both speaker and headphone jacks and microphone jacks.  You would want to cull out any that have active circuits (requiring external power) and possibly any with a volume control (although that might not be a factor) and aim for the switch box configuration that matches your plug and jack arrangement.  All computers using 1/8" mini-plugs will require that the switch have plug connections to the PC. In your description, you'd have to have one that had jacks instead of plugs, which is unlikely. To accomplish such connections, you would either cut the plugs off and replace it with jacks or purchase female to female adapters to jumper those connections.  The other locations in the switch would be jacks to accept the expected headphones and speakers, while your intent is to connect the phone circuit and the computer circuit. This would be accomplished with either male to female jumpers or male to male jumpers, both of which are commonly available online.    Another reason the above linked product is unsuitable is that there is no provision for a microphone. Ensure when you search that the product allows for switching both microphone and headset when performing the button press.
Answers up front:     does it support an additional SSD or have I to replace its current HDD with a new SSD?   Yes, you should* be able to install an M.2 SSD alongside your current HDD (see below). You can also replace the current 2.5 inch HDD with a 2.5 inch SSD.     And which form factor should I look for when shopping?   The M.2 SSD and 2.5 inch HDD / SSD / SSHD form factors are compatible with your laptop. I do not recommend SSHD "hybrid" drives, they're extra money for no real world gain.    Explanation and source  Here's a nicely detailed teardown I found:  https://www.laptopmain.com/msi-gp62mvr-6rf-leopard-pro-disassembly-and-ram-hdd-ssd-upgrade-options/  I'm operating under the assumption that you have a "MSI Leopard GP62MVR 6RF" PRO, as I can't find any info on other models.  From the picture in the link, your laptop supports a 2.5 inch standard form factor HDD / SSD as well as an M.2 SSD.   Seems to me that if you took the HDD option, the M.2 slot will be empty. You can pop off the bottom of the laptop and check for yourself. If this is the case, you can definitely order a compatible M.2 SSD and install it fairly easily.    Part Recommendation  I'll be happy to help you pick out a specific component if you can confirm that you have the "PRO" model of the laptop for me. Don't want to waste time researching for the wrong model laptop.
Not Bluetooth, but wifi, therefore it qualifies for "other wireless technology, the "aiball" camera comes in as a candidate. Available on Amazon, as well as a few other locations, it doesn't come in with high praises via the reviews.    Here's the better part of this answer. Once you visit the Amazon link, you see other small wireless cameras that may give you the solution in a better manner than the aiball cam.
Your question might be more of an engineering line of reasoning, but it's still hardware related.   Consider the mounting points for your mainboard. They are "scattered" around the board based on standards for case mount placement. They are almost certainly engineered to take stress from the components on the board and transfer that to the stand-offs attached to the case.  In that configuration, the forces are more-or-less evenly distributed over the mainboard, perhaps with additional mount holes near high-load areas such as the processor and heat sink assembly.  I have assembled a couple computer boards which did not have stand-offs in the case but had mounting holes. This was a flaw or failure in the case engineering but had little effect on the installation.  In your case, literally and figuratively, you would want to ensure that every mounting hole was properly secured and supported the board. If your intent is to secure the mainboard only at the edges, I would suggest that is contra-indicated. To secure all of the points, it would be necessary to build "branches" from behind the board to secure where possible, or in front of the board, providing support from either side.  The best support will be provided by branches that are perpendicular to the mainboard. Those that are not would allow some flex in the structure. If one cannot create a perpendicular-to-the-board branch, one should consider both a vertical and a horizontal branch joined at the mount point.  I would not suggest that it is "wiser" to avoid such a construction, as the other factors for this design have not been referenced.
The drives will be purchased separately from the NAS.   I suggest your better off building a PC.  Use a NAS with four bays, two for large HDD, and two for fast SSD  Case with 3  5.25 bays are easy to come by.  I have a SSD enclosure that fits into a 5.25 bay that holds 4 SSD.  Also using 2x 5.25 bays you can easily have room for 2 or even 3 regular hdd.  2 hdd per raid limits you to striping or mirroring and some motherboards have built in controllers which can handle these modes easily.  pcie card for 10gb, you can even have a dual or quad card. pcie card for thunderbolt.  Even if you go crazy your budget makes this project easy.  $800 for amd x1800, 16gb, and asus x370-pro (which even has a M.2 ssd port for 2gb/s) $200 for a case,psu, removeable hdd enclosure and ssd 4x in 5.25bay  $150 for a slight older intel dual 10gb card  $600 for an adaptec 7805(or similar) raid controller.(because I got money to burn)  https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboard-Accessory/ThunderboltEX-3/ $79  https://www.cdw.com/product/ASUS-ThunderboltEX-3-Thunderbolt-adapter/4259577?cm_cat=GoogleBase&cm_ite=4259577&cm_pla=NA-NA-ASU_IN&cm_ven=acquirgy&ef_id=WdOaEAAAAIMrZiAP:20180323201802:s&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-cfe9KGD2gIVD4rICh2-WguNEAkYASABEgLEaPD_BwE&s_kwcid=AL!4223!3!198553132221!!!g!315976140630!  $100 for any low end video card    Still have money left, party time.
So I ended up buying a 6s for now and buying a SnowLizard 6 case for the phone.  The battery is excellent with the case and I can plug my on headphones in when needed.
Summary  Â£100 is a pretty tight constraint, so I won't be able to pull into too many bells and whistles into this recommendation. What I managed to get as a baseline along these three tablets is 32 eMMC internal storage and 2 gb of RAM. I've recommended products you could purchase today that should be available to you in the UK. The only differences between these tablets is the CPUs:   Option 1: Slowest Option 2: Slightly Better Option 3: Significantly Better     Cheapest Option: Onda V80 SE Tablet Â£71.85 @ Newegg    This tablet features Android 5.1 and based on it's review it features a older Intel Atom Z3735F Quad Core (Release: Apr, 2014). It's benchmarks indicate this it will operate slower than any of the 3 options, meaning it will be the least "snappy" when used.  Slightly Better Option: Onda V80 Plus Â£90.60 @ Newegg    This tablet features Android 5.1 + Windows 10 (I would recommend using the Android OS unless you need the additional features of Windows). It is functionally the same as the previous option, but with 2 OS's and a slightly better processor,  Intel x5-Z8350 (Release: Jan, 2016) (it's Passmark score suggests it will perform about 26.5% better than the previous option). You might even want to consider uninstalling the Windows operating system for a little more space as it doesn't sound like the extra functionality is worth the performance hit.  Budget Stretcher: Teclast P10 Â£98.99 @ Newegg    The most powerful of the Tablet options and using the newer Android 7.1 OS, this tablet will stretch your budget, however it is marginally more powerful (according to benchmarks). It's cpu (RK 3368-H) Passmark score suggest it will perform about 2.6x better than the Onda Plus option. This option will be the "snappiest" and unlike the previous Onda Plus option, won't come with the wasted space of Windows 10. Consider this option if you want the most bang for buck performance wise.    Keyboard: Wanmingtek Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo Â£16.99 @ Newegg    None of the tablets I curated came with keyboards, most likely because of the low end price restriction. It's a cheap blue-tooth keyboard, weighs less than 300 grams and will get the job done. It also comes with a mouse if you don't feel like touching your screen. This will unfortunately put, option 2/3 slightly over budget.
I suspect its a little too small but at least in theory the unihertz jelly pro probably checks off most of your boxes. I have the non pro version, and have had to use it as a primary phone for short periods of time     budget armoured up oneplus 3 for scale.  That's the jelly compared to a fairly standard 5.5 inch phone/   Its a bit on the fat size but very light - I have it as a backup phone and fits in a jeans coin pocket with the optional rubber case.  Its all plastic, right down to the screen - this actually makes it more drop resistant than many fancy modern phones.  Runs a fairly stock android, with 7.0 out of the box   Replacable and removable battery.  2.4 inch screen - its a bit on the small side but works alright even with fairly big hands.  No stylus but any capasitive stylus should work, and you get one for a few dollars.  I'm not sure how long unihertz intends to support the jelly for but there's a planned 8.1 update, and it ships with 7.0  Camera is terrible but I run it as a secondary phone.  My dad uses his and... is slightly ambivalent towards it so it might be a little too small.
I've not run this specific model before but I've had good experiences with Xiaomi - and they have an android one model this year. Even if you don't go with a xiaomi - android one phones are likely to be what you're looking for. They're essentially "Google" phones like the nexus and pixel series, but designed to be cheaper and stripped down, with a mostly stock google experience and a fairly typical 3 year upgrade cycle.   The cons here? The 1a's an iphone clone design wise, with a stock android experience. It probably looks more expensive than it is. Its got an aluminum body, a fingerprint scanner and more or less most of the features you'd find in a older flagship phone. It even does USB C. No removable battery but that's a pretty uncommon feature  The pros? Xiomi's hardware is pretty good - I've got a xiomi 1s that's still running years on, and since its android one, you get a mostly stock android experience optimised for an older phone. And 5.5 inches is pretty much the 'sweet spot' for a modern phone, and its big enough for most things.
Summary  When it comes to considering processors directly, my preferred method of doing so is evaluating their online benchmarks. This allows you to rank processors relative to each other quite easily without actually having them on hand.  In general, it looks like the N4200 is going to be the better choice as Intel's MSRP appraisal of both processors is the same at exactly $161.00  Straight line performance  Some of the immediate differences between the N4200 (Released Jan 2016) and N3710 (Released July 2016) is that the N4200:   Real world performance is about 50% better than the N3710 according to it's PassMark score. Ultimately outperforms the N3710 in all common benchmarking software.   Power Consumption  In terms of power consumption, each processor is estimated to cost about 1.25$/year, so there is no effective difference in power consumption, However; the N4200 will output about 12.8% more performance per watt making it more efficient than the N3710 variant.  Memory Support  According to the official Intel spec sheets of the respective processors [N4200 here], [N3710 here]:  It appears that the N4200 is equipped to handle DDR3L/LPDDR3 up to 1866 MT/s, and LPDDR4 up to 2400 MT/s, while the N3710 only supports DDR3L-1600. This means that the newer N4200 processors will be able to handle newer RAM types with faster timings. This will effect the effective application load in speed.  Interestingly enough, however; the N3710 supports twice the Maximum memory bandwidth.  Special Considerations  CPUBoss reports that the N3710 is capable of being pushed further via Overclocking than the N4200 by nearly (45.5% by air, difference is nominal if you are using water cooling (7%)). This is only applicable if your motherboard supports overclocking, or whether there are any linux based programs that you can control your processor speed from.
Sony MRWE90/BC1 XQD seems to fit all my requirements (yet to buy it to find out for sure), although it is almost as big as 2.5" HDD enclosure and costs over $50 (former drawback is more important for me)  so my search continues with added criteria:  smaller than Sony MRWE90/BC1 XQD and without XQD slot, or with USB type C connector, or docking station / port replicator that has full-sized SD slot  EDIT: yes, it does, except second slot for sony's proprietary XQD memory cards is useless for me until XQD to SD adapter is created
Its extremely unlikely that a NAS or home server's going to be faster than local storage. You're better off getting fast local storage first if external disks are slowing you down. Your file server would be bottlenecked by your network. As such, the extra speed of 2.5 inch enterprise drives or SSDs are unlikely to be of much benefit, though your representative might not have addressed this well.   Typically 2.5 inch drives have smaller capacities but tend to be faster (smaller platters) or SSDs. 3.5 inch drives are often nearline drives and have similar internals to SATA drives with the SAS interface.   However over most common household links - say gig-e your bottleneck is the network, not the drives. Even on 10GBe its probably less of an issue.  Taking that into account, you probably don't need SAS. Regular sata drives would probably be just as good.  I'd suggest however that you see if your system supports thunderbolt (which essentially is the fastest external storage interface you can get currently) and/or upgrade your workstation and server to 10GBe. Its slightly costly (though there's good second hand, or new-low end options) but either option should get you better performance than what you see now.
The problem with your idea is that if a keyboard has two different ways to connect, it's going to favor one of them by design.  The demand for a keyboard that types the same thing on two computers at a time is next to zero, so you won't get automatic switching.  What you want is called a KVM switch, and this is an example.  It allows you to control more than one computer with the same keyboard, mouse, and monitor. This allows you to switch back and forth by using toggles on the switch, and you can share hardware between the two machines.
The telling part is in the last part of that little chart. Note that it displays an 8+4+4+4 dual-channel configuration, but in reality, you're only getting 16GB of the 20GB you install in that configuration.    That's normally a big sign that the 16GB RAM limitation is something tied to the motherboard chipset, and you're not going to get around it. In this case, I think it's just really lousy documentation on the part of HP. Be ready for contradiction. If you go to the actual HP support site, it says this motherboard's chipset can handle up to 32GB DDR3.  That's a 4x 8GB.  Another hint that the documentation you have is nuts is the fact that a configuration that reads 8+4+4+4 as dual channel is nonsensical.  Memory won't run in dual channel mode unless the RAM capacitance is matched.
Summary  It's going to be difficult to find laptops that have a 4/5 battery life without sacrificing on performance. I have decided to curate 3 laptops an I think you'll see that it may be worth it to go for a slightly cheaper option that has much more performance. As a student it would be strange if you were to be in a position to code without any power near by (library, cafes, etc) unless you explicitly tried to code somewhere without power.  You also stated that you wanted the laptops to cost less than 1,300$ USD, but since I am recommending laptops that you can purchase today to be shipped to Bulgaria, I had to use the exchange rate: 1.3k USD -> 2,063.75 Bulgarian Levs.  XPS 13: Long battery life at the cost of performance  Ð»Ð² 2,068.97 at newegg, MSRP Ð»Ð² 2,483.46   This XPS 13 configuration has a 7200U processor. If you're not familiar with the Intel letter system, U stands for power saver, which means that the processor is designed for long battery life instead of performance. It also features 8gb of DDR3 RAM and a 128 gb ssd. It has no dedicated graphics card which will also help for longer battery life. This laptop is in common use by university engineering students in the US (usually in it's more powerful, less battery efficient variants in order to support 3D modeling).  According to this review:     The XPS 13 9370 with 1080p non-touch screen lasted 12 hours and 37 minutes on the Laptop Battery Test, which involves continuous surfing over Wi-Fi.   ASUS Zenbook Pro: Long battery life, High performance, Bigger cost  Ð»Ð² 2,987.85 at newegg, MSRP Ð»Ð² 3,586.17   This laptop features a much more powerful i7-7700HQ Quad Core. It also features a PCIE NVMe 512 GB SSD. If you don't know PCIE ssd's are dramatically faster than traditional ssd's (up to speeds of 1+ gb/s read/writes) which will make heavy applications visual studio load much faster. It also comes with a thunderous NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4 GB which will make any 3D/game programming a breeze. It also features a generous 16gb of DDR4 ram which have feature slightly faster RAM timings that allow for faster application load in (iex. visual studio).  In addition this laptop features an 8-cell Li-ion battery, which will help with battery life. According to this review:     Asus' notebook endured for 7 hours and 38 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test, which involves browsing the web continuously over Wi-Fi.   MSI GL62M: Best performance, Lowest cost  Ð»Ð² 1,580.99 at newegg, MSRP Ð»Ð² 2,054.99   This laptop is the cheapest laptop among the 3, and has arguably the best components for the best value. It features a high powered Intel Core i7-7700HQ Quad Core, and additional discrete graphics card -GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4 GB GDDR5, 512 GB M.2 SATA SSD (a little bit slower than PCI-E), as well as 16 GB of DDR4 RAM.  As an additional note, this laptop will have the best keyboard among the 3 choices, as it is a gaming laptop, featuring MSI's signature anti-ghosting steel series keyboard. I personally own the GS-60 Ghost, and can say the keyboard is very good for a non mechanical keyboard.  In terms of battery life the MSI is going to fall back, but in exchange you'll be packing a punch in performance and price.  According to this review:     The laptop lasted only 3 hours and 33 minutes on our battery test, which consists of continuous web surfing over Wi-Fi at 150 nits of brightness.     I highly recommend option 3, but if you absolutely demand a 4/5 hour battery life, you might as well buy a portable battery for laptops like one of these, and it will still be cheaper than the 2 options.    Special Considerations regarding Mac based application development (Swift)  You've probably noticed that I didn't recommend any Macs. This is because they are not as "friendly" to application development as other operating systems, and tend to be overpriced if you buy them specifically for the hardware that exists in them. I personally program using the Xamarin technology to create universal, cross-platform mobile apps, but this requires me to have a mac available to even build and test the iOS version of my universal app. In order to get around this I use a Virtual Machine emulator, specifically VM Player with a special patch which allows me to run a mac virtual machine on windows. This site offers a guide on how to do this.

You might be able to fit a low-profile nVidia GTX 1050 or 1050Ti in there, and that card would allow some modern gaming, but that is definitely not a gaming PC.  The GT710 is an old business-class video card that is often used to allow multiple monitors on the same workstation, but is as bad as some on-die processor video adapters when it comes to processing.   I looked at the spec sheet on that machine; it's designed to be a multimedia micro tower.  Even the top end configuration for it only has a GT730 video card, and thats not much better than the 710.  It does have an available 90w power supply upgrade, but as you discovered, even the most basic gaming setup requires more than that.   You've also got a problem with that Pentium or hurk Celeron processor.  Those are flat-out too weak for games.  If it's an Intel processor and it doesn't say "i3", "i5", "i7", or "i9" at the beginning of its name, it's just their low-power junk they sell for cheap, and most games won't run on them at all.   Unfortunately, all I have is bad news.  That computer won't fit your kid's needs.  You discovered that "cheap computer" and "gaming computer" are mutually exclusive.  I tried to find this machine for sale in the USA, but it looks like it would run around $200 if it were available here.  A light gaming computer in that price range won't happen, unless you can pick it up used.
Consider using the Laptop Finder feature on LapTopMag.com. After answering about a half dozen multiple choices questions, it displays a list of up to 10 laptops to consider based on the selection criteria entered while answering the questions.  The requirements of a 17" display and 4 GB of graphics memory will add a significant amount to the laptop cost and limit the selection of applicable laptops.  Based on your stated requirements and some that I inferred ($1K or less target budget and average battery duration), these are the top 5 suggestions generated by the Finder.   Lenovo ThinkPad P71 - $1259 PowerSpec 1710 - $1400 Dell Inspirion 17 7000 2-in-1 (7th Gen Core) - $900 Acer Predator Helios 300 (17 inch) - $1357 OriginPC Eon 17-X (2018) - $3712   Full disclosure: this website does contain header and right vertical banner advertisements. (I've seen some for Dell & Acer.) That could influence the results generated by the Laptop Finder.  Regarding the processor selection, version 8 is significantly faster and more power efficient than version 7 for the i5 and i7 Intel processors. For many performance tests, an i5 version 8 processor will outperform an i7 version 7 processor. The Intel 8th Gen vs 7th Gen page on LapTopMag.com covers this.  Retailers are just beginning to switch from version 7 to 8. A recent Best Buy website search had about a 2 to 1 ratio of v7 to v8 laptops. So be aware of this difference.  From laptopmag.com on 4/6/2018: Which Laptop CPU is Right for You?
Here are your two main issues:     My CPU is the Intel Core i5-3350P @ 3.1GHz - A poor CPU by todays standard, I often find myself having 100% CPU usage while gaming.      My GPU is the Nvidia GeForce GT 640 1GB - Another poor component by todays standard.   The i5-3550p is a locked (i.e. can't overclock normally) processor, though your motherboard may allow you to force it to its full turbo speed (around 3.3 ghz).   This is adequate for gaming, but a new processor couldn't hurt. Except your wallet, as the newest processors use DDR4 and a different chipset socket, which means new motherboard.   If you want to avoid buying new RAM, you can get an i7-3770k; it's the same socket, uses the same RAM, and is unlocked for overclocking.  Get yourself a Noctua D-15 cooler and you can really crank the speed on it.  The video card is hands-down your biggest issue.  That's not just old, it's also slow for its own generation.  The GT *n*40 series was effectively the minimum discrete video card nVidia sold per generation.  You can compare it to its modern replacement here.  For about $100 more, you can probably get a GTX 1060, or a second-hand GTX 970.  With almost all games, the video card is the most taxed component, and your old card just doesn't have the texture memory (1GB) that newer games need to load all of their textures.
The Arc Hub can supposedly do this, but it's expensive, as such hubs are still relatively new.
I would be looking at the graphics card as priority #1, your CPU could always benefit from an upgrade but it is running 3.1ghz with 4 cores and a 6mb cache (not a slow processor), the bigger bottleneck here is definitely the GPU.. I would advise going with the latest gen 10X0 series of Nvidia cards, the 1080 would be a great addition. Make sure your motherboard takes PCI express so the card will be compatible. For the small saving I dont see it worth going for a 970/980, also the EVGA 1080 looks to be the best buy.  Next I would install a SSD, then 8gb more ram, DDR3 is fine.. Only then would I look at upgrading your CPU :)
Laptop cases can be night-and-day different, even in the same line.  One of the main ways that the laptop market has avoided being overrun by enthusiast home-builders is to use proprietary parts that are specially shaped to fit aesthetically pleasing cases which change every product generation.   A quick Google Image search on these parts will show you that they are very different.
Going off the fact that you claimed about 90% RAM usage during your typical use scenario, it is likely that your RAM is paging to SSD and degrading performance.  Most of your specs are fine, so it is unlikely those are going to be bottlenecks. As an additional note windows typically only uses less than 4 gb, and chrome typically doesn't use more than 1gb unless you have a lot of extensions. That would leave 3 gb for Unreal Engine, though I am surprised that Unreal is using that much RAM. Unfortunately I don't use Unreal engine a lot so I don't know what the typical memory usage is. You might want to look into your applications and see if any are using inordinate amounts of memory.  As for the recommendation, I was unable to find much information on your MOBO and the DELL support site wasn't very helpful. The spec sheet for your cpu was more useful:   I've recommended 16 gb of RAM as I think that this will be more than enough to ensure that your computer isn't paging to hard drive. To put this in perspective, I have 16 gb on a laptop and only come close to filling that up running multiple Virtual Machines in parallel alongside Visual Studio + Re-sharper.    This newegg query contains a huge list of RAM upgrades you could purchase for your computer sorted by price. I've made a specific recommendation below:  Specific recommendation: G.SKILL Ares Series 16GB  $125.99 at newegg   I've chosen RAM rated at 1600 as your core specifies this is the fastest that it can support. The raised speed will allow you to load in applications slightly faster than if was rated at 1333. It also has the lowest CAS latency that I could find at 9 (specifically: 9-9-9-24). If you wanted to save money while maximizing for performance trade off, you could go for RAM with higher CAS latency, but it will increase the delay for your RAM.     Specifically: Cas Latency(ns)/frequency(mhz) * 1000 = response time(ns)   Therefore, if you bought a 1600 speed RAM with a CAS Latency of 11, it would have a delay of 6.875 ns which would be a 22.222% increase in delay from equivalent RAM rated at CAS Latency 9.  It's been a while since I've looked into the RAM market, but I remember G.SKILL, and Corsair being heavily praised in the self-building PC community around the time the 4k series intel processors were out. The Nemix and Team Group RAM seemed to be a little cheaper but user reviews seemed volatile. I haven't had much experience with these brands so I don't know how reliable their RAM is. I decided to recommend the cheapest "enthusiast" brand that I could recognize, but feel free to buy a cheaper RAM even if it isn't G.SKILL or Corsair.
I finally went for a WD MyPassport Ultra 3Tb for a reasonable price (~160$) and I can say it works very nicely and fast enough for the OSX Time Machine.  I would definitely recommend that external hard disk for doing backups of your machine (OSX TimeMachine but surely will be good for Windows machines as well).
This looks very promising.  It's a crab/spider like device, using cardbaord for legs, and an Arduino to control it.  From the comments on the linked page:     the servos cost $24 for set of 10 (bought 2 set) & the shield was $7   on Amazon, joystick was $7+shipping on digi-key and the transceivers   were 4/$6.50 on ebay. The Arduino nano and UNO I have along with the   LED, wires, etc.
I decided to go with the LogitechÂ® Wireless Wave Combo MK550.   Amazon list price: $54.00     Image from Amazon    Here's how it compared to my requirements:  Shared Requirements:   Wireless  Excellent battery performance (Ideally 18+ months)  No Bluetooth, unless the devices include a Bluetooth USB transmitter  Full/Regular Size (No "mini" or "travel" sizes)  Right-Handed  QWERTY  Not the Anker model 98ANWPSS-K1M1A (but can be similar)    Keyboard Requirements:   Full key set, which include dedicated1 numpad and function keys  Minimal+ media keys (such as Play, Pause, Stop, RW, FF) and volume control  Windows Key  Quiet    Keyboard Like to Haves:   OS Sleep key is nice  Shortcut to calculator is also nice  Flat Keys  Wrist bar  I am a programmer, so a dedicated1 Pause (Break) button is nice  I take screen shots, so a dedicated1 Print Screen button is also nice    Mouse Requirements/Preferences:   5-button design  Mouse wheel includes the "left/right" clicks  Rubber thumb (preferred)  Laser preferred over optical, but not required  I use a mouse pad, so doesn't need any special tracking requirements
There are the Pentax PocketJet/ Pentax PocketJet 200/ Pentax PocketJet II/ Pentax PocketJet 3, the 200 (200 dpi) or II (300 dpi) at eBay for prices ranging 60 USD and up and they come with an interface that both accepts parrallel ("LPT") and serial ("COM") connection, having the corresponding adapter cable.  Pentax PocketJet 200 and II have CUPS support.
It may be a touch more efficient due to the water convection of the heat works but water cooling still relies on fans to cool a radiator that cools the water. The thermal capacity of a liquid cooling solution, however, is a bit higher than just that of a heatpipe and a fan.  You should see a marked improvement of both thermal capacity and overclocking potential of the machine with a water cooling solution but I would suggest that if this is new to you that you go for a self contained solution like this.  The radiator is quite large though, so you may prefer one of it's smaller versions depending on the size of your case.
Something like this is probably what you're looking for.  In the Q/A section, they mention specifically going to VGA from an RCA connection.   You may need gender changers, available on the same site, depending on what cables you already have.
We'd need more specific information about your rig for more precise advice, particularly given the age.  Options (in order of estimated cost):  1) Investigate if your current motherboard supports any fan control capability (eg. PWM) - you'll need to get into your BIOS, but it sounds like you have already tried this and found nothing that looks like this.  2) Try a software solution like Speedfan. If the hardware supports it, you can manually control the speed of your fans.  3) Buy a resistor ; you can get a short wire that you plug your existing fan into, and then the other end into your motherboard. A reduction in voltage means a reduction in fan speed and thus a reduction in noise. It will also mean a rise in temperature but 30C is very low for a CPU so you have plenty of headroom. Fan resistor calculator.  4) Buy a new CPU heat-sink & fan (HSF) that is quieter and/or can be manually controlled. Getting one to fit Socket A/462 might be the challenge, and this will be proportionally very expensive. Decent modern HSFs would cost as little as Â£20/$20/20â‚¬.... but can you find one to fit.  5) Soundproof your case. Expensive, and why would you go to all the trouble/expense for such an old rig.  Could you use your Noctua fan? Yes of course, but you could. The difficulty would be getting it mounted securely in a position to maximise the airflow. If your 60mm fan is directly over the middle of the heat-sink, you'll probably find your 120mm fan would be offset to the side so the larger hub does not block airflow. You could combine this with #3 to reduce the speed/noise further.   Caveat: you would need to monitor temps to confirm that your final configuration is cooling the CPU sufficiently.   As a general rule, the warmer the temp, the shorter the CPU lifespan. So your noise reduction might accelerate this CPU's demise! On the other hand, it's lasted this long, and who's to say that you haven't got lucky with a very good chip. The cut out temp for that chip is likely to be in the 90C area, so Id suggest you don't let it get above 60-70C for too long.  Hope this helps.
Orange Pi Plus 2  $49 (USD) on AliExpress  It has:   10/100/1000M Ethernet RJ45 Four USB 2.0 HOST, one USB 2.0 OTG Support for Android, Ubuntu, Debian, Raspbian Image Supports HDMI output with HDCP    There might be other models (there is a slew of 'em) that fit the bill with more or less feature that you might want. This particular one has good power and features but might be overkill.
You can check this product : Tracker gps tk-102-2 xexun Link  You can configure it in order to send geolocation to a web server.   If you want to go in details, the mainboard on it is a SIM900. You can find some cards with it like this one
1) if it's a DDR4 system, would it support DDR3 as well?   Generally speaking, NO. What's the manual say?      2) should I buy an 8GB DDR4 (4+8 =12GB) stick or just get 2 8GB DDR (16GB) sticks for the same price ?   What's the documentation say about it?  If 16 GB is supported, it is what I would do, provided it is DDR4.  Otherwise just go with adding the 8 GB stick.     3) how would going for a DDR3 impact performance and also battery life?   It probably won't work, so performance will be severely impacted.
The real problem is that the difference between an external hard drive and an external hard drive enclosure is whether or not there's a drive in it.  Most of the manufacturers sell the enclosures separately, and those enclosures have little-to-no shock absorption when dropped.  This is because an HDD is intended to be a stationary form of media. SSD have no moving parts, so rather than perfect the enclosures, the preference is to use SSD. It's also common to use BD-ROM, if it's read-only media, because they have a decent lifespan.   Also, remember that the average hard disk only lasts three to five years in perfect conditions..  This is part of why datacenters are all dropping the HDD in favor of the SSD.  A thing in common with all of these enclosures is that they won't fit some of your optional requests.      Support multi-disk integration.   I think you mean an enclosure that fits multiple drives at once.  At that point, it's expected you want a NAS, so you usually just find small computer cases for this.     Have the independent power supply.   All of them have this.     Have dust resistant design.   This requires an airtight seal, effectively.  That drastically increases heat, which is a drive killer. Most cases for HDDs actually have fans to dissipate heat or vent holes (pictured) to prevent trapping heat against the drive. This outlines your need for something which isn't sensitive to dust due to a lack of moving parts (i.e., an SSD). Even if it's sealed properly and cooled, the seals are rubberized or foam and wear with time.     The SATA interface of the case is attached at the end of a cable, instead of fixed on the case. (to enable the flexibility of hard disk length (even if disk size is 3.5 inch, but I need to add a SAS to SATA adapter when I gain SAS HDD)).   I see the problem, but integrating a cable is never a solution. SATA cables are cheap, simple cables that need replacing from time to time.  SATA extension cables are readily available for power supplies with a SATA connector, for about $3 US a piece.  You can get long SATA cables similarly. These plug into my SAS->SATA adapter just fine ($15 part on Amazon).     The frame of the case can be easily disassembled and reassembled with a standard screwdriver for cleaning and maintenance   You can't have this and a dust-tight seal, most of the time.    I'd take a step back and look at your problem.  It sounds like you need to store Terabytes at a time in a portable manner, but that data may be rewritten in full repeatedly.  While you have drives now, you're looking at spending around $100 on specific, high-quality external components per drive.  You're in an environment where small particles are a factor and interfere with your moving parts, and you're trying to plan around SAS drive compatibility (which means 15000 RPM Server HDD). With all of that, your expenses will build rapidly.  For a bit more, you can just start using enterprise-level SSD like Amazon Web Services and similar use. For around $250, you can get an SSD @ 1TB and $400 gets an SSD @ 2TB.  They generate less heat, are less heat-sensitive, have a lower TDP, have no moving parts, are completely enclosed to prevent contact from dust, and can take a drop without losing data.  While an SSD ages faster if you write to the whole drive repeatedly, they still last physically about twice as long as an HDD and don't suffer from fragmentation issues.   For your needs, that's a better way to spend your money.   If you absolutely must use your HDD in a portable manner, I recommend a dock and a carrying case as two separate components. Something like this would one-shot handle your portability needs, and you can just plug in and use the drives in a dock to purpose.  To fit your SAS needs, all you'll need to do is find a dock that exposes its internal SATA connection so you can connect your adapter.
I personally use the Thermaltake WP200.  That is, the W200 core chassis atop the P200 extension chassis.    It follows the "if it's interior, it's metal" approach, right down to the removable motherboard tray on one side.  It currently houses TWO computers and came with power and USB headers for both; my i7 2600k on one side and my i7 8700k on the other, both overclocked and both with the massive Noctua D15-class heat sink and fans mounted on them without affecting case clearance.  Both use an EATX motherboard.  The case comes with no fans (nor should you typically trust a fan that comes with a case), but instead has mounting racks for multiple configurations.  Right now, the whole machine is air-cooled.  I have about 30 case fans running either in the case mounted modules, face panel, or on the actual heat sinks.   The P200 section serves mostly as where I manage my power connections and cables, as it contains induction fans and two 800w power supplies to supplement the 1200w one in the W200 area (and if I didn't use the EATX on the side with the removable mobo tray, I could have fit another 1200W there as well).   The drive racks are plastic, but it's a durable plastic, and they're made of plastic to keep them light.  This is because they can mount more than one way.  While the racks can fit in metal modules for the face of the machine, I reserved that for optical drives, a hot-swap bay, and headers.  Instead, I use the plastic racks to "hang" the drives into clip-lock bays that are on one side of the metal divider on the inside of the case, which makes swapping them easy if I want.  They use plastic locks instead of screws to hold the drives, which makes for quieter HDDs and easier replacement.   Obviously, it comes with modular connections that assist with cable management, and can fit multiple radiators for elite watercoolers.  The case can accept 120mm and 140mm fans in the same fan bays and racks.  The racks for the fans or radiators all hold with steel thumb screws so they are steady and I don't have to just depend on the optional plastic locks that can hold them into place (this case allows you to be lazy, I guess, but you don't have to be).    Fan induction points can be covered with a magnetically-fixed metal screen that comes with the unit (one for each potential point).  This keeps dust out and extends fan life, and makes cleaning your fan filters as simple as just a quick wipe over the trash can.  You can use rubber feet, but this thing is HEAVY when it's fully assembled and loaded with tech.   We're talking 85-125 lbs depending on what you put in it.  This upgrades your computer to furniture.  I highly recommend using the castors it comes with instead of the feet, so you can just roll it around to move it.  Otherwise, get a dolly with some straps.  The only complaints I have are its loaded weight and the way the external panels fit. They connect via plastic knobs (thick and durable) that are grabbed by plastic tension brackets in the external panel (replaceable but sort of flimsy).  The panels never fall off, but the top lid is currently missing one of its tension brackets, which makes correctly aligning the top and locking it in place a little annoying.  Edit: Also, the panels can be detached for painting so you can safely customize yourself if you want without harming the tech.  The Thermaltake "TT" logo is on the face panels, but is otherwise kept minimal.
Printer companies specifically avoid doing this because their margin only comes from ink sales.  They usually lose money on the printer itself.  This is true of most accessory-based consumer electronics; Microsoft loses money on every X-Box line of product sold, and makes a killing on licensing developers to make its games and online marketplace surcharges. When I worked retail, a Lexmark rep once revealed to me that we were buying cartridges for $20 that we were selling for $45 and that Lexmark only spent $1 per cartridge to manufacture and ship them, but that they averaged a $10 loss per printer they sold, and that loss carried forward.   That's why the guy at the store just shoves ink in your cart without asking, and why the printer ships with half-filled ink and calls it a "starter" half the time.  This means you have more to deal with than just cleaning the cartridge.  You need to know your cartridges a little.     Don't do this with an HP inkjet.  They integrate the printhead onto the cartridge, which is sort of nice, but they also sometimes rig them to detect inks of a different density and refuse to print.  I don't have a link for that one, but I've seen it happen.  If the ink is thinner, it may fail to detect, but the custom head may just vomit ink all over the page because it's expecting a certain density.  Even just normal ink refills with them takes a little care, and ink quality matters.  Lexmark will work, but not all of their cartridges are refillable.  Single-color cartridge printers (i.e. C, M, Y, K are in their own containers) are ideal.  Brother, some Canon, Xerox, and Epson all do this. They warn that using your own ink voids your warranty, but the cartridge will accept the ink.  Also, many of the cartridges are clear, so you can visibly see the fill level, and you don't have to worry about screwing up filling a tri-color cartridge.    Knowing the above, I'd advise starting with Item 3 on the list; get a printer that uses single-tone, individual carts.  Got one?  Great.  Clear cartridge? Even better. Now to prep the cartridge.   You don't want to soak the cartridge in bleach or vinegar.  Bleach is a bad idea anyway as it leaves a residue which may affect the ink.  Vinegar will break the dried ink up and flush it out, but it's likely to damage the rubber seals on the cartridge or expand the rubber so that it doesn't fit right anymore.  Always start with hot water and just observe the cartridge contents to see if it flushes (clear cartridge benefit, of course).  If you get all of the ink out, great.  If you have splatted hunks of dried ink inside, then vinegar might be your only (safe) solution, but don't let it stand for long, or you can damage the cartridge as mentioned above.   Allow to dry before refilling with your ink.  Keep in mind that a viscous ink and a watery ink aren't the same thing; if your printer normally dumps thin ink and you put in conductive ink, it may give you some spotty or splotchy results. I'd start small, here.
Knocking through the questions:    Storage is really up to you.   M2 drives are just a really fast connection that enjoys about 4x the write speed of SATA.  This means, from the perspective of a user, near instantaneous reads and writes.  Beyond that, it's basically the same technology as a normal SSD, so you're talking quarter seconds versus full seconds.  If you're making your storage decisions based on speed, SSD and M2 are the way to go. Same for longevity, as they last a couple of years longer than a classic mechanical HDD.  If you're basing it on capacity alone, you would obviously want HDD, but you may prefer a BD-RW that can write to M-Disc and a few of those discs for your long-term, read-only media like pictures of the family. The expense is higher but you'd get better storage than any of the other solutions for longevity.  With all of that hardware, a 650w PSU will be cutting it close, especially with a 1080ti in there (we will get to that in a second).  The PSU is one of the most important purchases in a PC or server build of any kind.  I'd look in the 850w+ range from a company with a good reputation and support like Antec or EVGA. The CPU may be an extremely important part of a computer purchase, but without the PSU, the CPU is just a block of expensive and cold silicon.  With a bad one, your whole build can die in a literal fire.  Never skimp on the PSU.  If you don't plan to game and aren't buying four of them to mine bitcoin and make gamers hate you for inflating the price even further, you don't need the 1080ti.  Not only is this WAY overpowered if you are just using the machine for a server and HTPC, but it's also not financially wise right now.  Video card prices are horribly inflated due to the fact GPUs are what you use to mine cryptocurrency, and it's killing the supply while the craze continues. I wouldn't bother with the GT-710, though.  It's an older card.  Honestly, if the most you plan to do is watch a movie as far as graphics are concerned, I would just get a 1050 or 950.  That motherboard doesn't appear to have HDMI out; if it did, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't need a video card, as I think the i9 still has the on-die video capability that the other series processors have.   Just as a personal note, if you're not primarily running this as a server, that i9 won't get put to use.   Modern processors for personal use typically cap out at the next step down.  The i9 and the AMD Threadripper are specifically intended for massive amounts of multitasking and multithreaded activities such as video encoding (as in, from scratch in a video editing environment) or server-grade shared processing.  If you're not using this for a professional purpose like that, you will save money and even get increased performance out of an i7 or an i5 in comparison.  Please note in this benchmark that a new-generation i7 that costs 1/6th the price outperforms the i9 you have selected in applications that use less than 5 cores; that's 90% of the consumer software market.  File server use won't change much between processors; that's not a CPU intensive activity.  If you plan to host applications for your whole household or business to be clients to this as a server, however, the i9 would be more worth it.
The laptops you linked seems to have slightly inflated prices given what they are able to bring to the table. Allow me to counter:  MSI GL Series GL63 8RC-068 $1,099.00 (3714.95 Brazilian Reals) @ Newegg    This monstrous laptop hits right in the middle of the price ranges of laptops you linked and outclasses each and every one of them in terms of specs. It comes armed with the latest Intel Core i7 8th Gen 8750H, note that the laptops you linked used the U series, which are under-powered in order to be more energy efficient. It comes with a 128 GB SSD, but this is no ordinary SSD. This is a M.2 Sata SSD with gigabit level reads and writes. It also comes with an additional 1TB traditional Hard Drive. Most notable it features a GeForce GTX 1050 4 GB, but you can upgrade this to the TI variant for an additional $98. An additional nice feature, is that MSI laptops come with it's steel series keyboard which features anti-ghosting technology for a great typing experience (I personally own an MSI GS-60 Ghost).  Not only will this be absolute overkill for simple android development, it is capable of heavier development, allowing you to virtualize servers and android VM emulation for testing. Last but not least, it will enable you to handle resource heavy game development should you delve into it.  I think that it to be a reasonable estimate to say that this laptop will last you the greater part of a decade.  Last but not least, the link to the site I gave would allow you to purchase this laptop today with free shipping to Brazil.
You've done a really good job of shopping your machine.  The specs on that computer are good for your budget, and the 1050 Ti has 4GB of texture memory, which isn't bad for graphic design, as you'll be making some rather large textures at times.   The only problem I see is that you have a 1080p display.  This is great for personal use and gaming, as the laptop itself will have a smaller display.  It will turn into a headache if a client wants 4k graphics or you also do some 2D work (which you will) and someone asks you to design a billboard.   The reason many designers use Mac is largely because the Retina display they have is usually higher resolution and is honestly a fantastic, very clear display that shows tiny flaws in textures you might otherwise miss.  That said, I personally hate Macs because they swallow most of their errors into logs only "Apple Geniuses" are permitted to read so that people keep thinking they don't break, compatibility is lower, and they are overpriced.   I would never recommend one.  What I would recommend is a better display.  In a laptop, this will cost you and will be what puts your video card through its paces, but that doesn't mean pay more for an upgraded display on the laptop.  What it does mean is buy a monitor.    The modern graphics design market doesn't usually have you work on-site unless you are a full-hire employee, in which case they will supply what you need. If they don't, they probably will be a bad employer to work for full-time. Instead, you'll meet with clients and potential employers and then once you hammer out what they want, you'll go home and put together a very general, unusable sketch-up of what they want to make sure you understand. Then the contract price will be determined based on the amount of work you expect to put into it, usually by the hour or bulk payments at certain steps. Once you are fully paid, you deliver the finished product.  Your designs will take hours or days to complete, particularly on your 3D contracts, so the employer won't be hovering over your shoulder and you'll do most of that at home.   For those reasons, I recommend you buy a companion 4k monitor as soon as you can.  You still want the laptop as a graphic designer who walks into a meeting and doesn't have the ability to demonstrate something looks like a fool and doesn't get selected for contracts.  If you can go as high as $1500 USD or so, you can get a decent video card with a 4k monitor on the laptop, but from experience, I can tell you a secondary monitor with greater resolution is a better way to spend your money.    As a personal note, you will want a desktop at one point, but that's more of a nice-to-have for a graphic designer that only becomes a need once you begin to build your client base.  The laptop will go with you everywhere, and even once you're working mostly from the desktop, your ability to demo from your laptop will be how you seal contracts.
As cybernard says, the only benefit of the laptop is mobility. And I don't see an overwhelming need for you to prioritise mobility over power.   And the downside of laptops is power, cost and maintenance. You get less for your money, and seemingly equivalent components will be less powerful, and you won't be able to upgrade/replace components.   The mobile 1050Ti is unusual in that it is at least as powerful as the desktop version - for some reason it has higher clock speeds. But with the money save with a desktop PC, you could upgrade your card to maybe a 6GB 1060, which is significantly more powerful.   In terms of CPU, a vanilla desktop i7 7700 is approx 20% faster that the 7700HQ. And I would imagine that cheaper/larger disk drives will also benefit you.  Laptops also have a problem with heat - they have a host of heat dissipation problems that desktops don't have, so you may well fine that a) your laptop would get hot and noisy during large jobs, and b) that the sustained hard work will take a much greater toll on longevity.... a laptop will usually be on it's knees long before a desktop equivalent.  So the case for a desktop is overwhelming...unless you feel that mobility is a sufficient offset for all the drawbacks.
That computer uses generation 4 (the final generation) of Socket S1.  There's a complete list of processors which can be used on your board on this site.    Please note that nearly all of these CPUs are going to be, effectively, a lateral change (especially now).  An upgrade for that computer is basically a new computer.
Upgrading the CPU on a laptop is near impossible. Even if you could physically replace the CPU with another socket-compatible model, there is no guarantee it would work. Laptops are not designed to be upgraded, so consequently, OEMs can heavily lock down the hardware and the firmware - it is entirely possible that your machine is geared entirely to the original CPU, thus even if a new chip worked, it would not be able to realise the expected improvements.  And again, even if you could do this, the benefit would be near-neglible. When you are facing an army of modern tanks, replacing your horse with a better horse won't do you any good!   The tech on this laptop is obsolete, so either work within it's limited capability or put it out of its misery and buy a modern replacement.s
Ended up going with setup 1 and using this RFID-reader from Sparkfun. https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14066  I interface the reader by use of the Mercury library in a Python program. Super reliable reader I can highly recommend.

Spectre and Meltdown have some things in common.  First, neither has been reported to be specifically used to attack any consumer system at all.  That's probably a matter of time, although with Meltdown you probably wouldn't know. Second, Intel has already begun to patch out the vulnerabilities, although they halted the patches back in January due to interference with actual CPU instructions in the wild and system stability problems that resulted. Finally, all of these require malware to reach your computer in the first place.   Later this year, Intel is releasing more 8th-gen processors (not 9th) that should run a little slower but have the vulnerabilities removed.  No word on what's happening with the ARM processor, though.  AMD isn't affected by Meltdown but they are affected by Spectre and are in a similar boat.   While Spectre and Meltdown are new in how they work, they aren't unique in the fact they work at all.  Regardless of your processor, the wetware (read: human) operating the computer is always the actual security weakness.  They originate from malware on the machine that hijacks something critical to your system and uses it to break your security.  The malware which executes this will probably be in the wild a little longer than most (just because so many systems are affected), but Intel is releasing firmware patches going all the way back to 10 year old processors to fix it, so that should trim down the lifespan of such malware.   That may have all read like any other malware suggestion, and that's because they're all basically the same.  Practice smart computing.  There will always be security vulnerabilities.  They are flavor-of-the-week in nature. The actual level of risk doesn't increase between processors for anyone except the marketing departments that want to sell more new processors.  Don't base buying a new processor on "waiting for the next one" or you'll just end up always waiting for the next one.
You can't just "go from ethernet to WiFi" because these are two different types of signal.  Anything that advertises itself as an "adapter" is known as a Wireless Access Point (WAP).  These are made to connect to existing wireless networks. That said, they are made for existing wireless networks to which you have access to add Access Points.    Please note that the little device for a VAIO you have in that link isn't an exception to this rule.  It's just a small one that uses a VAIO power adapter.  Beyond that, it's not different from any other.  WAPs and routers with a built-in WAP don't care who made your computer.    Also note that adding a WAP isn't like just connecting your phone to Starbucks Wi-Fi.  It usually requires access to the network as an administrator and a little bit of setup to make sure it's broadcasting on the same SID and, in the case of a portable router, is passing traffic and DHCP assignment management back to the router that actually runs the show. For that reason, a product like the one in your link will probably end up being a useless box of plastic, as taking it with you will still not enable connection to secure Wi-Fi in may cases.   If your goal was consuming Wi-Fi, I'd say get a USB wireless NIC.  Since your goal is to broadcast it as a hot spot, you'll find that this can work a couple of ways.  First, Windows 10 has the ability to broadcast as a hot-spot using the existing hardware or a NIC like I just mentioned.  Your computer serves as the host.  Second, see what it will cost to use your phone as a hot-spot for your wireless carrier.  This is usually a per-megabit charge or an additional charge at a flat rate added to your bill to give your phone permission to do so.   If what you really need is to connect multiple machines to wireless and allow them to connect to each other directly across that network, you'll need the WAP, but don't expect everywhere you go to accept your connection.
In a real world scenario, around 25-30 per AP gets the best out of the bandwidth of the access points. If you wanna a simple configuration, FS AP-D1750 is recommended, its software is based on the OpenWRT program and updated through U -BOOT technology. This frees you from the application selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application.
If all you need is Android Oreo, you can buy a Raspberry Pi 3 B (not B+!) for 35$ and install an unofficial build of Android Oreo on it, or you can install Android-x86 on your computer, which costs nothing. Might not be the best option, but definitely the most affordable option.
ZTE Tempo Go is an Android Oreo (Go edition) phone which is an 80$ android phone with acceptable specs. It has 8 GBs of built-in storage, 854x480 resolution touchscreen and 1 GB of RAM.
You've got a couple of problems with your spec and will need to work around them to proceed.   First, a USB connected speaker would need its own audio adapter onboard, or drivers that interface with the audio adapter on the host machine and a board in the speaker to convert the digital signal to an analog form internally.  Outside of headphones, there's not a lot of demand for that, so you may be searching for a product that simply isn't.  Second, the output of a speaker is limited by the amount of power which it can receive. The voltage available is only 5 volts, and in all forms the maximum current is less than a full amp (.5 for most, .9 for USB 3.x).  Depending on the USB port, that gives you under 5 Watts to work with. At max volume, you're looking at 93-96 decibels, but keep in mind that the above is peak for the USB port, and some of that power will go to converting the digital signal to analog.   This means your actual results will probably be closer to 75-80db, which gets you not much louder than a conversation. Speaker size also matters, and this will inhibit the max volume the speaker is physically capable of putting out there. A speaker that is under 2 inches is going to output so little sound under the power a USB port can give it that your audio will require a quiet room or your head close to it to hear it.   Small electronics usually wire an analog speaker directly into an onboard component, and if you disassemble something like an old Tiger handheld game, you'll find that tiny sound was produced by speakers that still took up a large chunk of the case. The way headset designers make it work is through additional components you don't have available that increase the size of their solution. They also have the benefit of the speaker being so close to your ear that the overall output power is less important. USB sound cards do something similar, and you'll find that all external sound cards that produce powerful, non-headset sound use a secondary power supply plugged into the wall.   My recommendation would be to use a Bluetooth adapter in the USB port, and use a battery-powered rechargeable portable speaker. Those you can find all day long, resolve your audio quality and power problem, and your analog audio jack will remain open. It's been awhile since I worked with a Pi so I don't know how hard it is to get a BT stack set up on one these days, but it's a wheel that already exists.
For gaming, one of the most important items is the GPU. Your two choices have the same GPU so now we get into subtle items.  The next item affecting overall (general) performance is memory speed! Not memory amount. 8GB is plenty but that 1st choice has memory running at 3000MHz. So pick #1. Make sure you understand how to set the BIOS settings as this is overclocked memory because if your BIOS ever needs to be reset, the default will not be 3000 MHz.  Pick #1.
Switching Bluetooth  Because of the popularity of smartphones and tablets such as iPhone & iPad, many Bluetooth keyboards are now on the market that can rapidly switch between previously-paired computers/devices. In product descriptions, look for wording such as "switch" and "multi-device".  Your MacBook certainly has Bluetooth support built-in, and your PC may. If not, add a Bluetooth dongle. There are many such dongles; I'd look for one supporting Bluetooth 4.x or later. Modern ones are no bigger than the size of the USB connector plug itself.    While I cannot recommend any of these as Iâ€™ve not tried it, here is one found after some quick searching on DuckDuckGo.    K380 Multi-Device Bluetooth KeyboardSupports WindowsÂ®, MacÂ®, Chrome OSâ„¢, Androidâ„¢, iOSÂ®. Offers a set of 1, 2, and 3 buttons to switch back-and-forth between as many as three paired computers/devices.
tl;dr   Use only LCD panels from manufacturers being certified as using truly flicker-free technology.  Ignore manufacturer claims and ignore labels on boxes, as they may be false.   Examples of such truly flicker-free monitors at a budget price with full-HD resolution:   BenQ GW2270HM 22-Inch 1080 LED Monitor, 5ms, 8-bit Display, HDMI. Available today for USD $ 109.00.  BenQ GW2270 21.5" 1080p LED Monitor,Low Blue Light Mode, True 8-bit Color Performance, VESA Mountable, D-Sub DVI-D. Available today for USD $ 89.00. While this monitor uses a DVI input rather than the HDMI you requested, you can use a HDMI-DVI cable such as this USD $ 5.99 one (HDMI is a superset of DVI).    LCD monitors may or may not flicker  Many, if not most, LCD flat-panel monitors produce flicker.   Older LCD monitors used fluorescent tubes. Whether driven by magnetic or electronic ballasts, all fluorescents flicker, by their nature. Avoid this entirely.  Modern LCD monitors use LEDs are used as backlighting. Ideally, these would perform with no flicker at all. But real-life is not always ideal.  Pulse-width modulation â†’ flicker  Unfortunately, must manufacturers save a tiny amount of cost by using a technique known as PWM (pulse-width modulation) to providing dimming. This technique omits the circuitry that ratchets down the amount of electricity to naturally dim the LEDs. Instead, these manufacturers rapidly turn the LEDs off-and-on, off-and-on, off-and-on. If the LEDs spend half their time off and half the time on, then the brightness appears to be halved, for example. Unfortunately, the user is now staring into what is effectively a disco-like strobe light (not good).  While the conscious mind may not notice this flashing, many of us are indeed sensitive to this flicker. This results in headache, migraine, and so on. Personally, I suspect everyone is impacted even if perceived subliminally as â€œstressâ€ or â€œtired eyesâ€ without recognizing the cause.   The solution is to avoid any display using PWM. Unfortunately, there are unscrupulous vendors who label their product as "flicker-free" despite using PWM. There is no regulation or industry control over the term "flicker-free".   Flicker-free certification  So the only sure solution is to use a monitor that is certified as being truly flicker-free.   BenQ    One vendor that does not use PWM and is certified as flicker-free is BenQ. They offer a wide-range of monitors from budget-value to business-office to photographer-color-accurate to gamer. All their monitors are flicker-free. I use a 32" 4K BenQ monitor, but they offer budget-priced full-HD (1080) monitors as well.     They are certified by a German & US company, TUV Rheinland.  Eye-comfort = low-blue-light  "Eye-comfort" usually refers to the monitor offering a mode where blue-light is suppressed. Certain wavelengths of blue light are thought to mess with our circadian sleep cycle, and therefore avoided in the evening. This blue-light issue is unrelated to flicker.  For example, Apple offers this mode on Mac computers and on iOS devices, calling the feature Night Shift. This feature works only on the built-in screens. So if you want the same effect on your external monitor, you must buy a monitor with this capability built-in. You will need to manually enable/disable the low-blue-light mode on the external monetary by pressing its physical control buttons.  Beware: Colors are altered. Since shades of blue are suppressed, of course the colors are no longer true. Within a very few minutes, your eyes/brain adjust. So generally you will be unaware of the color changes if just casually browsing the web or typing email. But you cannot do high-quality photo-editing or video-editing with this mode enabled if you need accurate color portrayal. And you should not shopping for any products with just the right shade of some color while this low-blue-light mode is active.  Again, this low-blue-light feature has nothing to do with flicker. Two separate, orthogonal issues.   A quick check shows that most all the recent models of BenQ monitors recommended above offer this mode. They provide this page and this white paper explaining these issues.  The same TUV company provides certification for low-blue-light, just as they do for flicker-free.
Both of these monitors are 1920 x 1080, 60 Hz monitors. The primary difference is their physical size. The benefit of the larger monitor is that (assuming you would have each at the same distance from your eyes) you will be able to lower the display scale on the larger screen and potentially fit more in view.   Note: there will be substantial loss in visual fidelity. The smaller monitor will give you about 50% greater pixel density than the 32" screen. The flipside is that obviously the larger monitor will be more comfortable to look at from a further distance, and for tasks that require less fine detail (such as watching non-bluray quality movies) the larger monitor will just be more pleasing to look at.  Pixel density calculator  You must determine whether the increased size is a better value for you than the bump in pixel density.
I do understand wanting quiet. I am dubious about your choice. It says 25 dB at its lowest setting. That means if you put any load on your CPU, it will speed up and be louder.  This one is $20 and its high noise level is 21 dB. Hope that is within your budget.
Arctic Cool Freezer Pro 7 r2  This is my go-to budget cooler. Much quieter and a better cooler than stock HSFs.  Also buy some decent-but-cheap thermal paste, such as Arctic Silver 5 and Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut.   Combined, these should set you back 25-30 GBP/USD/Euro.  Also perhaps look at some fan-control s/w such as Speedfan - even when you can't improve temps, you can change how your fan responds to them. Some rigs crank up to 100% fan speed too early.  EDIT: The Freezer Pro 11 LP is a low profile alternative. With LP coolers, compromises are made (i.e smaller and directed into case, rather than to rear), so it will be harder for it to keep the same CPU cool in comparison. However, this one is still cheap and still quiet.
I'm going to boil down your question to "how do I get the laptop I need, with the hardware in it I need, without getting slammed by the nonsense from politicians and businesses playing at trade wars".     First off, I wouldn't buy a Mac, and if someone gave me one, I'd sell it and buy a PC.  The generation you're looking at are literally normal Windows laptops with the Mac OS installed and crammed into a Mac fitting, but they're still Mac fittings, so they're expensive or near impossible to repair. Then there's the compatibility with software, and finally just that you're paying new-PC money for old-PC tech.  Second, you're right that most of the best laptops have the "gaming case" look to them, but that's not a reflection on quality.  Asus makes the RoG stuff and it's some great hardware. I will say, though, I once got my ex-wife a Lenovo Thinkpad that had a better display than a Mac to get her off of Macs, and saved $500 doing it.  That's a good brand.   As for obtaining things for reasonable prices, that gets tricky.  Right now you're dealing with taxes and possibly some sanction issues. That means that any ideas I have on it, you'll want to check with how laws in your area apply and are enforced; one place's innovation is another place's tax evasion. While in the United States, the government might not blink an eye if I had a friend in another country buy a thing I can't get here for a good price and ship it to me, they certainly would if it hit Customs and it turned out there was supposed to be a tariff on imports of that object.  I'd get hit with at least a $500 fine.   There's also the whole "use a proxy and buy with bitcoin" approach, but since every nation is watching bitcoin transactions like a hawk now, It'd be less trouble to take the trip to the Eurozone.
Don't worry about cloud computing when it comes to graphics adapters; at this time, there's no realistic way to process high-definition graphics and then pitch them to a screen at 60 frames per second over distributed computing vs. a card on a PCI-E bus.  Going off of your diagram:  Macbook Pro:  The issue you'll have here is largely tied to your code.  The machine will swallow some exceptions and bury them in a log that only an Apple "Genius Bar" can access.  You also get less hardware in the machine for more money, and have the usual compatibility issues with having Mac OS instead of Windows.  The hardware is actually still just the same stuff you'd see in a Windows PC, but your service is handled through Apple.  The only exception is the Retina display, as these are exceptionally clear and color-balanced out of the box. You may have noticed in the diagram that competitors now offer similar hardware here, as well, which closes this gap. 4GB of texture memory on the video card is just enough to push this resolution if you decide to game or do any 3D design work.  Lenovo X1:  Having first-hand experience with the display on this one, I can tell you that it's one of the best. It's not as high-res as two of the other offerings, but it's matched well with the maximum capabilities of the graphics adapter. Unfortunately, said adapter in this case is the on-die Intel adapter that comes part-in-parcel with an Intel i7-8550U.  The U stands for "underpower" in Intel SKUs; that is to say, the processor is underclocked and under-spec in order to provide significantly longer battery life.   The 8th-gen U-series are the first to offer quad core options, but any demanding computing is likely to be inhibited by the product. It's very light, though, so if you have access to a desktop at home with better specs, this makes a great portable work machine.   Gigabyte Aero 15x:  Gigabyte is a big name in motherboard manufacturing, similar to Asus but without the weird stigma that some business-types add to the "Republic of Gamers" sticker and price premium added to the Asus laptop shells.  A gaming laptop is just another term for "most powerful laptop available" and in no way suggests the machine isn't ideal in a work environment; computer design progression is pretty linear when it comes to that sort of thing.  The unit is larger and heavier, but with good reason; you get the newest, proper "H" series of i7 processor in it, with the very powerful 1070GTX from nVidia with all of its lovely texture memory.  This unit is effectively a portable desktop.   You're limited to 1080p resolution on the monitor.  On the surface, that sounds, bad, but in a laptop, it's really not.  Modern LED screens at high resolution use "scaling" to make icons and text larger.  If you leave them at their native sizes, they become too small to read properly on an Ultra-High-Definition display when the display is only about 14-15" diagonally across (which is how screens are measured).  If you're not doing graphic design or gaming at 4k+ resolution, anything more than 1080p in a laptop is usually a waste.   The only other downside I can see here is that with all that power, battery life will be shortened.  This is why you always see gaming laptops plugged in; you only get 2-3 hours out of the battery if you're doing something that really takes advantage of the machine's sheer processing capability.     Overall, this would be my pick given the choices.   Dell XPS 15:  This machine is a good compromise, and has the highest-resolution display of the lot.  You'd definitely want to scale your desktop a little in order to see clearly for daily use, but you get some nice hardware here for the price.  The only real loss here vs. the Gigabyte is that the video card is less powerful and has half the texture memory, which can make for a slow gaming experience on newer games (especially if they support resolutions higher than 1080p).    The reason it's easier on the wallet is because the processor inside is a generation behind the one in the Gigabyte, but it's still a very good processor by today's standards and I strongly doubt you'd see a difference.  I'm not a huge fan of the Dell brand, but I think you'd be pleased with this unit as well. You will likely get longer battery life out of the Dell due to the lower power consumption of the graphics card.   Conclusion:  I would go with the Gigabyte if price isn't an issue and you can reach an outlet when you're doing anything particularly intense.   Barring that, I'd recommend the Dell.   If battery life is the most important criteria, Lenovo's will have the best.   I wouldn't bother with the Apple.
Bluetooth is a proprietary technology which is managed by the Bluetooth SIG.  Unlike "Wireless A/B/C/N/AC", which is the networking technology standardized by IEEE, Bluetooth is tightly managed by this group and specific patents are required when making something Bluetooth compatible.  This means that the "stack", which manages to what and how a device can connect to other BT devices, is often proprietary to the device itself.    You can experiment with this by purchasing a Chinese-local Bluetooth headset designed for phones and trying to pair it with a Dell laptop that has integrated Bluetooth.  Chances are, your device won't pair, and you'll have to download the Chinese company's BT stack to your computer and install it.  This often interferes with the existing stack that comes with Windows and may create new problems.   This, and the inherent short range of BT, are why you see devices that will take commands via WiFi and relay them via Bluetooth, but not accept commands via Bluetooth and convert them to a traditional WiFi signal.  It takes a machine with a compatible BT stack and its own connection to a wireless network of some sort via its own wireless adapter.  That's why you're seeing the articles that you're seeing; they do exactly that.    Obtaining the BT patent and permissions to build a router that does this specifically and selling it as a consumer item faces hurdles manufacturers wouldn't want. BT is intended for short-range, so any product like that would immediately catch flak from misunderstanding consumers for being terrible once they're out of the same room.   A Bluetooth Router which can connect to your WiFi router, however, does exist. If you read the Amazon reviews for it, you'll find that the low-star reviews all involve problems I've described here (failure to pair due to BT stack, range issues past 30 direct feet, etc.).    Your best bet is probably to use a computer or phone that will manage its BT-connected peripherals as peripherals and just give other things access to those peripherals via Wi-Fi.
I've done this with a common Epson multifunction that has a document feeder.  Receipts are a legal relic because they're entirely dependent on the belief they can't be fabricated well, so you'll get stupid requests like being told you need to scan in the full receipt but not cut it into segments. Obviously, if given that limitation, you'd normally have to fold it and scan in each segment using the scanner bed.   Which is stupid, because then you get the same result, it just takes more time.  Think about it; how would a 30-foot x 3 inch document look on a laptop display?  The answer is, "like a white line down the middle of the screen".  It will also take up a massive amount of graphics memory unless the quality is particularly low, in which case the text would zoom poorly and you'd have a new problem.   You can also obtain your own printer and print a receipt for anything anywhere, saying whatever you want, if you're that nefarious individual who keeps returning Nerf guns without the bullets or whatever.  My solutions have varied by demand:   My ex-wife hid income from the IRS, and they demanded receipts for my deductions I took for that tax year because she moved out to the boonies and went off-grid after the divorce.  My attorney wanted the uncut receipts scanned in.  I cut them into 14-inch lengths, loaded them into the document feeder, and then Photoshopped them back together.  I worked for a company that required we pay for a lot of things on our own and just reimbursed us.  They wanted the original, uncut receipts, but it was honestly an awful job and they would claim we never sent receipts when we did.  If we sent them cut or folded to fit in the envelope, they'd say they were invalid.  Either way, we'd no longer have the receipt and couldn't say anything else about it.  I paid for a cheap receipt printer online and got the thermal toner and roll for it. Then I did the trick from #1 and provided endless streams of "original but abbreviated-format" receipts until I stopped having that problem from the company, as I had convinced them I had contacted the other businesses involved to continually request copies that could fit into interdepartmental envelopes without folding.  This one fits your OCR demand.  I needed the receipts to come in and easily have values dropped into Excel tables.  I wanted them to go straight in, not just get dumped into a Word file and leave me to parse (that would not have saved time at all).  For that purpose, I used a product similar to (but not the same as) this Pen Scanner.  It's tedious, but it worked.    In the end, it's a matter of "any scanner".  The nature of receipts has rendered the need for a massively belt-fed receipt scanner relatively obsolete.  The Fujitsu ScanSnap can manage up to 30 inches.
Technologically, these machines are effectively identical.  I think the Zenbook as a slightly larger case and display area, but that's it.  I'd lean to the Zenbook, both for aesthetics and the fact I'm familiar with ASUS's excellent warranty service.
The best option would be to convert a Dual Shock 3 to work as a PC gamepad.  There are several by Saitek which meet the main requirements (six face buttons, PlayStation style dual analog, USB):   Saitek P2900 Saitek P2600 Saitek P2500 Saitek P990   A couple from Logitech:   Logitech Wingman RumblePad Logitech Wingman Cordless RumblePad   And two others:   Buffalo BSGP1601BK Sabrent USB-GAMEPAD   The last two have more of the nice-to-have features than the Saitek or Logitech choices.

You need a DVI-Male to VGA adapter:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IWP87S  plus a VGA to Component converter to connect the PC to the analog TV.
how about this: https://www.amazon.com/Inateck-Enclosure-Supported-Tool-Free-FE2007/dp/B00T2ODFCU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1518966488&sr=8-1&keywords=Inateck+FE2007  it is a 2.5" USB 3 drive enclosure with three full-sized USB 3 ports (enclosure and USB hub in one device). it is made by a company that specializes in USB enclosures so it seems very unlikely for them to repeat whatever engineering mistake that makers of your "generic USB hub" had made.  P.S. did you try to run your setup with some other PC or laptop to ensure that USB hub is to be blamed rather than your laptop?
Video editing favours CPUs with a relatively high core count but also good single threaded performance. I'd recommend a Ryzen 5 1600 but if that's too expensive for you, I think you should go with a quad core Core i3 or a Ryzen 3. I'd recommend the 8100 model as its price won't be much higher than 100$.
Based on the currency you selected and information I gleaned off your profile I'm assuming that you live in France and want to be able to buy a laptop that could be shipped to France.  Lenovo Laptop IdeaPad 320 â‚¬545,99 (MSRP: â‚¬720,99) @ Newegg    Features an i7 7th Gen 7500U. If you're not familiar with the Intel lettering system, U signifies that the laptop is a power-saving laptop. Effectively this means that the cpu speed is reduced to achieve longer battery life and energy efficiency. While not breaking any land speed records, will be more than enough for basic coding and internet surfing. Don't expect to run heavy IDEs like Visual Studio without some lag. This option's CPU is about 59.7% slower than option 2 according to it's average cpu passmark benchmark. It also comes with 1 TB HDD and a 256 GB SSD, for a total combined storage far above your requested storage amount. The laptop also features 8 GB DDR4, which you shouldn't come close to filling up in any normal user case scenario. I've even managed to fit in a dedicated graphics card, the NVIDIA GeForce MX150, but that's really gratuitous at this point. You might actually be able to play some really visually intensive 3D games at really low settings.  Acer Laptop Aspire 5 â‚¬671,99 (MSRP: â‚¬754,99) @ Newegg    The laptop cpu, first of all is an i7 8th Gen 8550 U. The laptop also features 8 GB DDR4. It also comes with 1 TB HDD and a 256 GB SSD. Like option 1 it has a NVIDIA GeForce MX150. You're really paying for the newer, faster CPU at this point.  You should be able to set any laptop to dual boot if you simply install both operating systems on it. I'm assuming you're going for a Linux, Windows set up and this should be very feasible.
I have a Logitech Harmony 785 - discontinued now - and it has the capability to learn controls from existing remotes. I'm not sure whether all the current crop all have the same capability, but I would imagine so.  https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/harmony-universal-remotes
For gaming the Ryzen 5 2400G will do just fine, but virtualisation is a heavily multithreaded workload. Although, the Ryzen 5 2400G is a quad core. I recommend the Ryzen 5 1600 (6 cores 12 threads) as it will do really good in games (especially considering the new APIs which are said to scale the games across more cores than previous APIs) and I don't think it will have trouble running a VM. Last but not least, it is overclockable (just like the Ryzen 5 2400G) and the included cooler will serve you just fine for light overclocking. Also, if you pair it with a solid graphics card it will run AAA games at high settings(same goes for the Ryzen 5 2400G)
Ryzen has the clear advantage. How good a CPU is isn't only affected by the number of cores. There is much more to CPUs than that. Ryzen does way better in both multi-threaded and single-threaded workloads than any FX chip because of that. Core count is what companies use for marketing as the average user thinks  that more cores is always better, which is obviously not the case. Also, as mentioned by previous answers, your rig will be upgradable with Ryzen as AMD will continue to support the AM4 socket for a couple of years.
The machines are identical from what you've shown, save the processor and motherboard.   That really makes this a "which is better for my purpose, a current gen Ryzen or a current gen i7".      When it comes down to it, the i7 handles single-threaded to quad-threaded apps better than the Ryzen, but the Ryzen shines when used in 4+ thread applications.  Their current pricing is nearly identical.   Since the 2700x is a new processor (relatively), there is less anecdotal information available and it's hard to find information about overclocking.  Still, what information we do have suggests that the two are pretty comparable. If you're a particular fan of one company over the other, you can probably just go with your fandom preference and not have it bite you (which is rare for fans of any tech company).  If you don't care, I'd buy whichever cost less, unless some of your rendering software can take advantage of more than 4 cores (AMD) or specifically does not (Intel).

I would strongly recommend against anything below the latest generation of the Intel Core i5 lineup for graphic intensive workflows, even my (admittedly 5 year old) Intel Core i5-4570 struggles from time to time with Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro.   I would highly recommend the CPU linked below if your budget will stretch for that.  AMD Ryzen 5 1500X  Just to note, this uses the AM4 socket, so you would be looking at more expensive DDR4 RAM rather than DDR3, as this is the memory type that the processor supports.
After extensive searching, I found a few options.    Eurocom X4C. This is what I eventually ended up buying. It has up to 64 GB of RAM, two M.2 slots, the desktop 8700k, and 1080 GPU, and a selection of several different screens, including on UHD version. It's also 15.6 inches, so pretty much exactly what I was looking for. The only issues I'd mention are that it's somewhat prone to backlight bleed, and, like most computers built on a Clevo chassis, has a little give in the keyboard.  Hidevolution Evoc P750TM-1. It seems to be built on the same chassis as the previous, and has similar specifications. One advantage is that it comes with up to 2800 MHz RAM, rather than the 2400 MHz standard on the Eurocom.    There are a few other options I found (e.g. from Acer) that had a 4k screen, but either had "only" 32 GB of RAM, came with only a 1070, or both. If these aren't obstacles, one of these laptops might be the better choice, since they're much more professionally put together.

I'm looking for a small laptop with a 10.1 to 11.6 inch screen and an x86 or x86-64 CPU that runs GNU/Linux without hardware incompatibility. Are there any good ones?      My current laptop is a Dell Inspiron mini 1012      [â€¦] I use it for hobby programming projects while riding the city bus to and from my day job.   One of my screens got cracked in public transport, so I understand why you prefer smaller devices. Is this your Dell mini 1012?  Such small screen sizes usually only feature a 1366x768 resolution at this time. Even though you are used to 10.1 you may want to look a bit beyond 11.6 and get FHD or better screens in return.  Comparing the size of the 10" Dell mini with my 12.5" ASUS C302C, it makes up for its size by being slim and sturdy:  Dell mini:  270 x 198 x 36 mm Asus C302C: 304 x 210 x 13.7 mm         A Chromebook with Chrome OS cannot run most of these applications. As far as I can tell, they would need to be rewritten from scratch in JavaScript as Chrome apps.      We might need to reevaluate this list from time to time. The move to Android apps solved some problems but I'm not saying that it solves yours. Containers on Chrome OS aka Crostini though may solve your problem, but it's not clear at the moment if it takes one update cycle (6 weeks), more than a few months or if it happens this year at all judging by how it went with Android apps on Chrome OS.     A Chromebook with Crouton begs the user to press space to reenable OS verification (which wipes the drive) every time it turns on. I'm told tools by John Lewis can remove this verification warning from the bootloader, but I assume they void the manufacturer's warranty, and I've had to use my current laptop's warranty before on a loose power jack.    Yes you can remove the warning. I would recommend mrchromebox.tech's script though as it is actively maintained. To disable write-protect you'll usually find a DIP switch or a screw that shorts a circuit. If your laptop is still booting you can always recover through recovery media or through the script and revert back to the state where your device is eligible for warranty. In times of USB type-C make sure to get a device with more than one USB-C PD capable port, that should solve this problem. I've heard about loose power jacks, but it didn't happen to me.   Chrome OS Weekly Buying Advice Thread  VictoryGoth posts weekly advice on reddit, at the moment the following devices would meet your criteria, be sure to check that the processor is not an ARM one though:   Acer Chromebook Spin 11 (11.65" x 8.11" x 0.82"): https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/series-features/acerchromebookspin11 Asus Chromebook C202SA (307 x 199 x 20.9 mm): https://www.asus.com/Commercial-Laptops/ASUS-Chromebook-Flip-C213NA/specifications/ HP Chromebook 11 G6 (12.04 x 8.18 x 0.71 in | 306 x 208 x 18.05 mm): http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/laptops/product-detail.html?oid=18280450#!tab=specs Acer Chromebook 11 N7 (11.72" x 8.27" x 0.87"): https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/professional-series-features/acerchromebook11n7 Acer Chromebook 11 C771 (11.72" x 8.23" x 0.82"): https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/NX.GNZAA.002 Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-132 (11.57" x 8.03" x 0.73"): https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/NX.G4XAA.001   As I said, I would check 12.5" models too should you go with a Chromebook, you get higher resolutions and better processors.

Possible? Yes.  Desirable or functional....now that's a question.    Your motherboard only supports IDE/PATA connected drives.  This is the traditional "ribbon" cable connection.  This means you will need an IDE/PATA cable-connected drive, like this one:  https://www.amazon.com/128GB-KingSpec-2-5-inch-SM2236-Controller/dp/B0091T4ZWU  Please note that the price of this one piece of hardware is worth more than the entire rest of the rig combined, and it's still only just over $80 USD for 128GB.  You're also limited to PATA IDE communication speeds, hamstringing the SSD.  If you're just an enthusiast and like to keep up old machines, it might be worth it to you, but I recommend looking into a new mobo, processor, and RAM if this is your only computer.
For budget, don't go with a laptop unless portability is essential for you. Although the performance gap between laptops and desktops has shrunk with recent CPU and especially GPU series, a laptop capable of good video editing will still cost a lot.   I'm assuming that you're looking for something under â‚¹70,000 (1029 USD).   For price, I'd highly recommend building your own desktop. You'll probably save a few hundred US dollar in labor right there&mdash;not so relevant for multi-thousand dollar machines, maybe, but for a budget device it's OK.   The recommended requirements for After Effects are modest, simply a multicore CPU and 16 GB RAM. To get good performance, you'll probably need a little more than that. I'd recommend an i7 CPU (or the AMD equivalent).    If you step back a generation, you should be able to grab one of the best Intel CPUs of its generation, the i7-7700k, for about $250 used or even new. For example, here.  For RAM, I'd go with 16 GB of DDR4, which should be around $150.   For your GPU, try getting a used 1060 for about $200. Depending on what you're doing in After Effects, a GPU could be essential or barely necessary, but CPU is usually a lot more important, so this is a compromise.  For the motherboard, you might as well get an H370. Motherboards are cheap to begin with, and anything lower will set future upgrades back unnecessarily. For example, here for $132.  For hard drives, I'd get one fast working SSD and one large HDD for storage. You can get a  2 TB  HDD (7200 RPM) for about $50, and a 500 GB SSD for only $150 or so.  You can probably grab a budget case for about $70.    This totals about $1050 for a mostly new system. It should be very much capable of dealing with After Effects. It's slightly over your maximum (and I haven't included fans, power supply, etc.) but you can slice a little off by getting a lower tier motherboard (save $70), or a 250 GB SSD (save $70), or by getting the RAM used. Using a 6700k (two generations older, but similar speeds and can be overclocked anyway) could also save you a little.   I won't talk about fans, etc., since they'll contribute relatively little to the price.   If you really need a mobile system, it's going to be much harder to find a good one. There are a few good options, though, such as the Acer Aspire VX 15. This has a 1050 Ti GPU, about 16 GB of RAM, and a 7th-generation i7 CPU. Storage is minimal, though, so you'll end up needed an external hard drive, and as a laptop its performance will certainly be lower than than a desktop of similar price.
Have you considered the Dell Latitude 7490? For 1700 or 1800 USD, you can get a 14.1 inch screen, 16 GB of DDR4, an Intel i7-8650U (supposedly up to 4.2 GHz), and a 512 GB SSD. It also seems to have 4G capability. It does only have Iris graphics.  I'm sure the battery can hit 4 hours, and it has a multitude of ports.

If you want a true 100W USB-C dedicated charger that has no other function (no other ports stealing the power, all 100W is in the one USB-C, and not a docking station), then I suggest the Wacom MobileStudio Pro charger:  https://buywacom.com.au/products/accessories/cables-and-power/power-adapter-for-mobilestudio-pro.html  If any visitors are in Australia, I believe it has RCM certification for use here. Also, unfortunately, the cord is not detachable. Laptop manufacturers who make these chargers tend to hold on to what they are used of, which is laptop chargers with hardwired cords. This means the cord cannot be replaced if damaged, it cannot be swapped for cables of different lengths, and if anybody actually cares, it would make it impossible to fast charge an iPad with the USB-C to Lightning cable (the only way to charge at full rate right now).    As for multiple ports, there are ones with 8x 60W USB-C PD ports. Also ones with six and four, plus a cabinet with 20x PD ports (up to 60W each, but shared with 120V per bank and 4 banks for total of 480W):   https://www.coolgear.com/product-category/usb-c-products/usb-c-chargers https://www.coolgear.com/news/new-usb-c-power-delivery-products-coolgear.html

The review reflects a general rule about monitor resolution; given the same resolution, a 27" monitor will be slightly less clear on text and fine lines than a 24" monitor.  This is where pixel density matters.   Unfortunately, this isn't measured the same way a monitor's screen is measured, as pixel density is about how many pixels there are per a standard unit of measure, but monitor size is measured by the total screen length from the lower left corner to the upper right. Just like that one South Park episode, they measure at an angle to get a higher number.   1920x1200, 24"  3840x2160, 27"  1920*1200 = 2,304,000 pixels 3840*2160 = 8,294,400 pixels  Both of these resolutions have a 16:10 aspect ratio.  We now have all of the numbers we need to determine quite a lot about the monitor.  We have the hypotenuse of a right triangle (24") but we have a different standard of measure for the sides (1920px L, 1200px W). We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to determine what '24"' means.  1920sq + 1200sq = 3686400 + 1440000 = 5126400  sqrt of 5126400 = 2264.155471693585  3840*2160 = 14745600 * 4665600 = 19411200  sqrt of 19411200 = 4405.814340164597  Now we know how many pixels lie across that hypoteneuse for each monitor at the given resolutions.  This lets us determine an estimate of density by ratio.   2264.155471693585 / 24" = 94.33981132056604 approx ppi diagonally.  4405.814340164597 / 27" = 163.1783088949851 approx ppi diagonally.  Clearly, the higher resolution monitor here wins out.   That's because the 4k monitor is nearly double the resolution, and is not double the size.   The user who left the review likely had trouble seeing some things clearly on the 4k monitor because they were shrunk in size as a result, and lowered their resolution to 1080p; 1080p is not the native resolution on the monitor, and will appear blurry by comparison. This will also happen in fullscreen apps which do not support higher than 1080p.   For text, I'd still use the smaller monitor.  Given what I just said about reducing resolution of your display, text will appear smaller in native resolutions at 4k than it does in 1080p at the same font size and kerning.
I would recommend,  [MSI H110M Gaming][1][1]: https://m.newegg.com/products/N82E16813130918  Since you are on a budget and the fact that your only using a 1050 ti this motherboard should just do the job, it only comes in at around $60.

If you're willing to try for Intel, Eurocom, Hidevolution, and a few others have laptops with a desktop i7-8700k, which should give you 12 threads on its 6 cores, and 64 GB of DDR4 RAM (dual channel, naturally). These would not have a CD or DVD drive&mdash;you'd need to get an external one, but with all those ports you'd have no trouble connecting it. You can get these as small as 15.6 inches. They should come in under $3000 with a 256 GB SSD and a 1 TB HDD, an 8700k, and 64 GB of RAM, and you'll get 1060 GPU in the bargain. There are also some new workstations with similar capabilities, but they will be pricy.   Any of the options I suggested will have more than enough space for 1 TB of storage. In point of fact, there are 4 TB SSDs now, so you really can get more storage than you need as long as you have a single SATA slot.   With any of these Clevo resellers, I'd strongly recommend that you ask them to check carefully for backlight bleed before shipping. It'll save you the trouble of loosening the display screws yourself. Also, they'll be loud, and will have low battery life.   The optical drive is really a difficult thing to find in conjunction with a six core or greater CPU. If you filter by "64 GB  RAM or more" and "optical drive" on Amazon, you don't find many devices. And most of those don't have an optical drive in any case. Even most workstations are moving away from internal optical drives.
Yes, there is such a remote. There are probably quite a few of them but the one I tried is the URC 6440. With the help of the information in the http://www.hifi-remote.com/ (especially the forums), it's really easy to program with any OS: it mounts as a USB drive, and using Remote Master it's just a matter of copying a file with the configuration. Specifically, this the configuration file I just created for the NAD D 3020 (without using the original remote at all), and it works like a charm.
You have a lot of options with those specifications. I'll assume that you're looking for minimum weight and maximum battery life. A two-in-one is probably your best bet for that&mdash;that is, tablet plus laptop configuration. Or a tablet with a keyboard.    You might consider the Surface Pro. It comes with up to 16 GB of RAM (but you can probably configure it with only 4 GB if you want), and it should have a long battery life: Microsoft claims that you can play video for over 13 hours. The current generation is actually 12.3 inches, but it should be much lighter than most laptops. It should have a pretty good processor, too.   Four gigabytes of RAM, an i5, and a 128 GB SSD should be about $1000. You are paying a bit for screen quality there, though, which might not be ideal - there are cheaper options with lower-quality screens.  If price plus battery life is your main concern, and you don't care much about performance or having a fairly up-to-date processor, you have much lower-priced options. For example, the Samsung Galaxy Book is another tablet-computer combo, is  about $630, and has a  10.6 inch screen with 4 GB RAM and a 128 GB SSD. It claims 11 hours of video playback. Or basically any of the ones here will be cheaper than the Surface Pro.
Dell S2719DM  This monitor is 27 inches, 2560 by 1440, and claims a brightness of 600 nits. This beats out even the brightest 500 nit Macbooks, and certainly the more common 350 or 400 nit ones. And it's only $350.  It's also fairly thin. It only has HDMI ports, but so does the Mac Mini, so no big deal.
I wouldn't use a PWM fan (plugs into motherboard) for this.  You're cooling HDDs and the thermostats on the motherboard won't be very good at detecting HDD temps, so you'll probably want the fan to run at maximum speed.  Instead, get fans that use your Power Supply Unit's molex connectors (the four-pin connectors that jiggle in their plug if you move the wires).  This pulls the motherboard completely out of the equation.  If your PSU is modular, one of the module cables should have these plugs on it.  Otherwise, they will be part of the wire bundle that has the other cables, or you can use a SATA -> 4-pin power adapter  (about 3 bucks on Amazon).   As for physical mounting, you'll want to mount to the front, back, or sides of the HDD.  If there is a fan already directly in front of the HDD pulling air in, then a second fan won't help much unless the case is particularly large.  If not, that's where I'd put the fan, and have it blow across the drives and into the airflow that drags air out of the top and back of the case.

These style machines (as pictured) are made with proprietary connections and components.   The problem you'd have, even if you found a way to adapt the connection to a standard PCI-E slot, is that the drivers for the non-reference circuit board that chip is on do not exist for Windows.   Considering that these are GPUs on part with a modern $200-250 card like the GTX 1050 or 1060, I'd save yourself the heartache of wrecking your tech and just get a new card for the PC.
I may have this wrong, but the following might be close to what you want.  PLUB: Don't plug in, PLUB in!  This is a tiny Bluetooth receiver that connects to wired headphones or earphones.    Description from the KS website: "Make wired headphones wireless! PLUB is the most affordable, compact and simplest-to-use Bluetooth receiver."  The KS campaign is finished and these devices are available from a number of sources.  If this isn't exactly what you want, it might be worth contacting the creators of this project to see if they can create what you are looking for.  That's the main reason for including the link to the KS campaign page.
Tons of Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer mice available on eBay.  I currently use the 3.0 version but others are available.  If you really like the Intellimouse mice, perhaps stocking up with a lifetime supply might be wise.  I have several of them myself for this very reason.  Also be aware that replacing the micro-switches (when they go noisy or intermittent) is quite easy if you are handy with taking stuff apart and with soldering small traces. I've never yet had the actual electronics fail but have replaced many switches and cables over the years.  Current price the the Intellimouse Explorer 3.0 on eBay is about US $30.
Any wireless router which has both a 2.4ghz band and a 5ghz band is capable of this, so long as the router firmware permits these to run on two separate SSIDs.   I know your pain with ASUS; I have a similar router from them and I now get drops, strange behavior, and my Steam Link has tons of issues with it, even though it's directly beneath the router and only has one uninsulated ceiling between.    While I haven't replaced mine yet due to expense, I recommend Ubiquiti (my current router) to handle your routing.  My ASUS is now just a dumb wireless AP, which helped somewhat but didn't resolve all of the problems.  Depending on space, you may want to look into mesh wireless, but as an immediate replacement, I would probably get a Ubiquiti access point to pair with the recommended router.
This is dependent on brand and design, so there's not a universal, fixed answer.   On modern toner-based printers, the average is around 13% of the toner being wasted.  Earlier or lousy models can go up to 25%.  While it's technologically possible to route the wasted toner from the waste sump back to the print toner, this changes the chemical composition of the toner to have less fusible material, lowering the quality of the print.  It is not in the interest of any printer company to overcome this issue, as the margin on toner is very high, as is demand.
You might want to look at the FritzBox 7312.  Reasons:   Supported by OpenWrt (see). Internal ADSL 2 / ADSL 2+ modem that is also seemingly working when installing OpenWrt (which is rare and I have not seen this explicitly stated with any other FritzBox supported by OpenWrt, but it might still work with others as well).     "ADSL: should be working, tested @TestBuild (AnnexB ATM & PTM) â†’ default: Annex A not enabled in Kernel" (see)  Very economical, as it is available used for <10 EUR incl. shipment (for example on ebay.de). Happens because older router models like this that came with people's DSL contracts are always very cheap because they are very much in oversupply.   Unfortunately, this router has only internal antennas and cannot be extended with external ones because there are no connectors (see). Also it has only 802.11b/g/n wifi (no dual band with 802.11a) and onlyone 10/100 MBit/s LAN port (see).  Alternatives:  I much prefer the FritzBox 7330, which is available for just as little used and eliminates all these disadvantages: dual-band wifi and external antenna option. But I can't yet confirm if its internal ADSL 2+ modem is supported by OpenWrt or not.
I recommend the FritzBox 3370 (tech specs here, although in German).  Reasons:   4 Ethernet ports. All are Gigabit Ethernet (1000BASE-T). Great signal coverage with external antennas. You would have to add external antennas, which is possible without permanent modifications, for example with the Frixtender products. You can add multiple different ones with different characteristics depending on your local situation. (I did not personally use the Friztender items so far, but added a similar aftermarket antenna to a FritzBox, and it works â€¦.) Dual band wifi. In case your wifi signal strength issues are related to having "too many neighboring wifis" with no locally unused, interference free channel left for you, then you can simply switch from the crowded 802.11b/g/n 2.4 GHz band to the 802.11a 5.0 GHz band. Range (esp. with obstacles) is less due to the higher frequency, but speed at limited range may be way better due to less RF noise. Supported by OpenWrt. See here. Internal DSL modem. Not too important, but saves one device. However I am not (yet) sure if OpenWrt supports the internal DSL modem. It does so for some FritzBoxes like the 7130 (see). If not, the LAN1 port of the FritzBox can be used as WAN port and a DSL modem can be connected there (see, in German though). Great price: 10 EUR. This is a product that did cost 180 EUR new, but the manufacturer support ended (no matter when you're on OpenWWrt anyway) and a lot of these are in the market from subsidized DSL contracts. So you can get lots of these for 10 EUR incl. shipment, for example on ebay.de. (I do not expect any problems with used, older FritzBox devices. One of them (model 7050) at my place is in use since 2005.)   Method of search. I selected AVM FritzBox as a brand that is good quality and usually supplies DSL routers that come subsidized with people's broadband contracts in my area (Germany â€¦), as that makes very cheap prices probable. Then I looked through all FritzBoxes supported by OpenWrt and found the 3370 to be the only dual-band wifi router among them with 4 Ethernet ports and a great price tag.  &nbsp; There are similar FritzBoxes that add an analog phone port but only provide 802.11b/g/n 2.4 GHz wifi and less than 4xGbit Ethernet (FritzBox 7320, 7330, 7360). (No match. Esp. since now that most domestic phone connections are SIP anyway, I'd rather choose a native SIP phone instead of combining it with a FritzBox.) And again others that are the same but without phone and internal DSL modem (FritzBox 4020).   &nbsp; Only the relatively new FritzBox 4040 comes close again. Unlike the 3370, it does not have a DSL modem but an Ethernet WAN port â€“ not an issue, as an external DSL modem can be connected to the WAN port when needed. Adding external antennas is also possible (see). It is however five times more expensive (50 EUR used on ebay.de right now) for basically no extra hardware features over the FritzBox 3370, except for "guest wifi". So my choice is quite clear :-)
Just the clock frequency and the number of cores are not enough to characterize a processor. It would be useful if you could share the exact model of the processors you have in mind. But, I am guessing you are asking for a comparison between i5-8250u (Base frequency: 1.6GHz Number of physical Cores:4) and  i5-7200u( Base frequency:2.5GHz Number of physical core:2) as comparison between these two models is pretty popular in the mid-range laptop segment.  If so, note that the i5-8250 is a eighth generation intel processor whereas i5-7200u is a 7th generation intel processor. Also note that the i5-8250 has max turbo frequency of 3.4 GHz against the 3.1GHz of the 7200u and a 6MB of L3 cache against a 3MB of cache in 7200u. Hence the 8250u is in everyway a better and efficient processor than the 7200u.  The lower 1.6GHz that you are worrying about is just the base clock rate i.e, the clock rate that all cores can simultaneously operate at under moderate load. Under heavy load, a single core of 8250u can boost its clock rate to 3.4GHz for better performance. The lower base clock rate is actually to improve power efficiency.
You have some options here.   Most Laptops come with a very basic card provided, 90% of the time, by Aetheros.   They often either do not connect to an antenna or they are connected to thin wires that loop the monitor and serve as an antenna.    The component connection is relatively universal, so if you can get your case apart, you can upgrade this card yourself. It's a small card about the size of one of those grocery store discount card keychain fobs.   Alternatively, you can plug in an external USB NIC.  These work better than most internal cards, as they have their own affixed antenna.  The only downside is that if you only have older USB ports and not the 3.x variety, your connection speed will be limited to about 10MBs/80Mbps in most situations.  These are often sale items on Amazon.   If your laptop is old enough to have a PC-Card slot, there are also wireless options there, but if the computer is that old, you're probably better off in the market for a new machine.
Found the hikvision ds-3eo318p-e 240w switch which can do eight 30w ports, but it's expensive.  Decided just to plug injectors into the current switch.  I started with my router going to a cheap 8-port 130w poe switch (30w per port max, purchased before the cameras), with a 12w fisheye and two 32w ptz on the switch.  Added two more 32w ptz to the switch, which worked fine until about 9pm each night when apparently the temperature would drop enough to make a camera heater kick in and draw just enough additional power to keep killing a switch port and make a camera repeatedly reboot.  Decided to spend $0 adding the last two cameras by running cables from the switch to the 60w injectors that came with the ptz cameras, then from the injectors to the cameras.  The switch doesn't bother sending poe to the injectors.  Instead of one switch and one a/c cord i ended up with the switch and two injectors and 3 a/c cords total, and everything seems to work.  If injectors hadn't been included with the cameras, I probably would just have bought another 4-port poe switch and fed it off the 8-port switch like the injectors are being fed now.
The big issue you're going to run into is the need for a hotspot.   While there are still recycled and cheap phones made by one or two manufacturers which possess the other features, it's very rare for any of them to also serve as a hotspot.   They are considered entry-level phones and usually use a proprietary operating system so everything "looks like the old days" and a user would need to buy a better phone to add new apps.   I highly recommend you migrate to Android, as address books and such haven't changed much.   Also, most of the mid-to-high range phones serve as a hotspot through their provider, though whether or not you can use it without wrecking yourself financially is up to your service provider contract.   This is a list of phones which have the other features you want. For a decent device which also has the keyboard as a physical component, Blackberry is your likely brand.  Most manufacturers simply don't use this now, as it's additional hardware (so additional expense), can be physically damaged through use, and the Android store features many, many options for free touchscreen keyboard alternatives to the one installed on a touchscreen phone when you get it.
I can't really say how effective it will be in an open space, but since your goal is to obfuscate the noise coming from your conversation, your options are pretty much limited to:   containing your sound generating additional unrelated sound   Many psychiatrist's offices use devices like these outside the closed office door to act as a sonic barrier between noise in the room and noise in the hallway. It is a fairly low-tech solution as it is essentially a small, very noisy fan within an acoustic amplification chamber. It is adjustable somewhere between "medium" and "loud". Its effectiveness will depend on how loud you are being and how close you are to the door.  Source: my wife and I use this specific model to provide white noise when we sleep.
I'll structure this response by increasing complexity of the solution.   Turn it off turn it back on. Use the power button to shut it down, some systems use quick-boot if you shut down from within the operating system. Quick-boot preserves the system state and as such cannot act as a system reset. (This one costs money)Buy an external WiFi adapter or NIC, as mentioned in the previous response. Also as mentioned previously, make sure your laptop has at minimum a USB 3.0 port if you want any reasonable speed.  Reinstall the drivers. This requires a small amount of technical knowledge, and can bork you WiFi card if done improperly. Using system info, identify your WiFi card. Then download the latest drivers from the website if you have windows, or your operating system's  requisite driver repository for all other os's. Uninstall the current driver, even if it's the same version as the one you acquired. Reinstall the freshly downloaded driver. Replace the WiFi card.(This one costs money) Don't do this if you have no knowledge of computer internals. Identify the make and model of your WiFi card. Purchase an identical one or a compatible replacement. Download the drivers for your new card. Uninstall your old drivers. Replace the WiFi card. Install the new drivers.   If none of these work, consider repositioning yourself closer to the router, or replacing you router with one that produces a stronger signal. Worst case scenario you might have to replace your laptop. Edited to give structure, posting the response initially smushed all the points together.
i asked Intel Customer Support about it, they said that TDP "should" also be a valid metric for low-intensity workloads, and that the Xeon E3-1235LV5 and Xeon E3-1240LV5 are the lowest TDP options for LGA1151... so the CPU i'm looking is probably 1 of those 2.
Any mod capable Moto Z series device can be equipped with a Livermorium sliding keyboard mod, although as of answering this question it is out of stock from the manufacturer but should be available by years end again.  The big issue here is the requirement for a hotspot, which most older phones would not support properly... So stepping up to a newer device is a requirement, adding in all the things you don't need (like GPS for example).  Your other requirement of a simple phonebook could be handled by any number of Android applications available from the Play Store, but that would be trial and error based on what the user likes and is beyond the scope of hardwarerec.
Your motherboard manual, which you can find a link to here, has a layout map on page twelve.  In the lower right hand corner of that map, there's a pair of pins that are labeled "CLR_CMOS". It is labeled by reference number 15. CMOS is the onboard memory storage for your motherboard, and is used to save BIOS settings. The CMOS memory can be cleared in two ways without booting the computer or accessing BIOS.   Follow the instructions on page 18 to short the pins and clear the CMOS memory:      Use this jumper to clear the BIOS configurations and reset the CMOS values to factory defaults. To clear the CMOS values, use a metal object like a screwdriver to touch the two pins for a few seconds.      Always turn off your computer and unplug the power cord from the power outlet before clearing the CMOS values.      After system restart, go to BIOS Setup to load factory defaults (select Load Optimized Defaults) or manually configure the BIOS settings (refer to Chapter 2, "BIOS Setup," for BIOS configurations).    Pull the CMOS battery from the board for a few seconds before replacing it. This is located near the center of your motherboard, and is round like a watch battery. In the diagram on page 12 of your manual,  you're looking for number 5 labeled as "BAT".   After you successfully clear the CMOS memory, factory default  settings should be restored and you should be able to boot the machine normally. Make sure to enter BIOS and re-configure any necessary settings before booting to your operating system.  If that doesn't work, my next order of business in terms of recommendations would probably be to take your power supply into a local shop for testing. This is usually free but you can always call ahead to make sure.
A package like the KKmoon HW0029 or the FREECAM C310 would probably do it pretty neatly.  To mount something on the poll you can use a bracket like this https://www.ebay.com/itm/Pole-Mount-Bracket-SUNLUXY-Universal-Column-Camera-Mounting-Bracket-8-inches-/282935918551
Thunderbolt 3 offers this already using USB Power Delivery of up to 100W     Thunderbolt 3 was developed by Intel[48] and uses USB-C connectors. It is the first generation to support USB. Compared to Thunderbolt 2, Intel's Thunderbolt 3 controller (codenamed Alpine Ridge) doubles the bandwidth to 40 Gbit/s (5 GB/s), halves power consumption, and simultaneously drives two external 4K displays at 60 Hz (or a single external 4K display at 120 Hz, or a 5K display at 60 Hz when using Apple's implementation for the late-2016 MacBook Pros) instead of just the single display previous controllers can drive. The new controller supports PCIe 3.0 and other protocols, including DisplayPort 1.2 (allowing for 4K resolutions at 60 Hz).       Thunderbolt 3 has limited power delivery capabilities on copper cables and no power delivery capability on optical cables. Using USB-C on copper cables, it can incorporate USB Power Delivery, allowing the ports to source or sink up to 100 watts of power. This eliminates the need for a separate power supply from some devices. Thunderbolt 3 allows backwards compatibility with the first two versions by the use of adapters or transitional cables.   However, your PC would obviously need a Thunderbolt connection.  If your current PC has only DVI or HDMI outputs, as your post seems to suggest, then as neither of those offer sufficient power for a monitor, then your existing setup would not accommodate your request.  HDMI 1.4a can supply power, but the port supplies only 50 &nbsp;mA at 5&nbsp;V DC over pin 18.  Apart from Apple's 27" Thunderbolt capable monitor, which they have just discontinued (although you may be able to still pick up some discounted remaining stock), there aren't that many on the market. LG recently announced two models:   34WK95U 32UK950   From LG teases new Apple-compatible Thunderbolt 3 monitors including '5K UltraWide' model:     The 34WK95U is a 34-inch model with 5,120-by-2,160 resolution, high   dynamic range, and LG's "Nano IPS" technology, which is said to boost   the "intensity and purity" of colors. Thunderbolt 3 lets the monitor   handle 5K images at 60 hertz, and connect laptops like the MacBook Pro   without an additional power source.      The 32UK950 will offer a similar featureset, but in a more   conventional aspect ratio and with a slightly smaller 32-inch screen.   The display is said to hit 98 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, with   peak brightness of 600 nits, and support a second 4K monitor through   daisy-chaining.
In general, performance RAID and SSD are not a thing you need to do.   The performance improvement is pretty minimal, and you'd only want to use RAID as a way to maintain multiple drives in case one begins to fail, allowing the other drives in the cluster to handle the load. If you're talking 10+ drives, performance RAID can come back into play.  HDD simply wont improve your performance compared to SSD.  An SSD will r/w faster than 3 HDD in RAID 0. You can't beat the abandonment of mechanical parts in an SSD.   I recommend using a calculator like this one to get an idea of your I/O speed results vs. requirements. Dedicated RAID vs onboard RAID is pretty much identical as far as performance and reliability.    In all cases, SSDs do indeed drop performance over time, but with modern SSDs, TRIM-style operations prolong this to a point that it won't slow down to anything close to HDD speeds until the drive is on its last legs, which is roughly two years after an HDD would have died anyway.   If capacity or cost are less of an issue, and all you want is performance, then a RAM drive may be the way to go.  These are faster than SSD and not subject to the same wear, and if you're doing that much work at a time, this might be a better approach.  You'd still want periodic backup to permanent media, but RAM drives are pretty much designed for how you described your use-case.
You're looking for an "HTPC" (home theater PC) remote, there are many and plenty of them are programmable / have bluetooth / assortment of other features.  If you update your post with a budget and some more specific features you want, or with a few options that you want advice on choosing between, I'll be happy to help you narrow down a few specific choices.
Yes, but don't get one if you can avoid it.  There are only two HDDs that fit the requirements you have: the Seagate ST2000NX0253 and the ST2000NX0303. At ~$300 each, these things are ridiculously expensive; you're looking at SSD tier pricing for a spinning drive.   My recommendation would be to instead get a cheaper 5400RPM driveâ€“my recommendation goes to the Seagate ST2000LM015 (currently $71.99) because of the reasonably large cache and Seagate's relatively solid reputationâ€“and then set aside some SSD space as a cache, depending on the write endurance of your drive and OS/platform.
Whatever's cheapest here.  Currently that's an MSI B360M PRO-VD for $55.99.  Since your CPU doesn't support overclocking, unless you have plans to upgrade to an unlocked chip, getting a Z series board is unnecessary for overclocking. As such, no motherboard will offer a performance boost, assuming it supports your RAM speed, whichâ€“based on the tier of the rest of the systemâ€“I'm assuming isn't particularly high, and is likely supported by all motherboards.  From there I've basically just selected for price. You may be losing some I/O, and most of the cheaper boards only support 2 RAM modules (not a huge deal since your system only supports dual channel anyways, unless you have plans to upgrade your RAM), but it shouldn't really matter too much.   I've additionally chosen to eliminate Biostar and Gigabyteâ€“not because their products are bad, but because of their relatively poor customer support.
I know its an old question at this point, but this answer should still be relevant to someone in need.  Crucial MX300 SSD (1TB) ($239-280 depending on retailer)     The Good The Crucial MX300 SSD is competitively priced and delivers fast performance. The solid-state drive uses efficient 3D flash memory and provides strong security with hardware encryption.      The Bad The drive has a short three-year warranty and trails behind its main competitor, the more expensive Samsung 850 Evo, in performance and features.      The Bottom Line If you're looking to upgrade your computer's hard drive, the new Crucial MX300 is a speedy and affordable choice.   Source
The "PC" number is a DDR module name, it indicates module's data rate.   PC4-17000 modules have 2133 MHz data rate (2133 &times; 8 &asymp; 17000) PC4-19200 modules have 2400 MHz data rate (2400 &times; 8 = 19200).   The 4 indicates that it's a DDR4 module. 17000 and 19200 are peak transfer rates. DDR4 data bus is 8 bytes wide, so 8 bytes are transmitted each clock cycle, hence multiplication by 8.  Now, which is better: PC4-17000 with CL 15 or PC4-19200 with CL 17?  CAS latency (or CL for short) is measured in clock cycles, so we can calculate how much time fetching data takes for each of these modules.   2133 MHz = 2,133,000,000 cycles &div; 1 s  Each cycle takes 1 &div; 2133 &micro;s  Latency is 15 &div; 2133 &micro;s &asymp; 7.0323 ns 2400 MHz = 2,400,000,000 cycles &div; 1 s  Each cycle takes 1 &div; 2400 &micro;s  Latency is 17 &div; 2400 &micro;s &asymp; 7.0833 ns   So PC4-17000 has slightly better CAS latency.  But! All RAM has to work with the same clock speed, so once you've installed 2133 MHz module, your current 2400 MHz module will underclock to 2133 MHz too.  I'd probably go for 2400 MHz one. Latency difference is very small, but clock is 12.5% faster.

Early 2011 to Mid 2012 MacBook Pro 15" non-Retina  Within the MacBook Pro line, there's two big cutoff points: the switch from a dual core in early 2011, and the introduction of the Retina line in mid 2012. For sake of rough comparison, we'll separate things out into these three categories.  Model                 | Passmark     | Cost          | RAM upgradability? | Storage upgradability? â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“ Latitude E7450        | 3400 - 3798  | ~$270         | Yes                | Yes Late 2008  - Mid 2010 | 1540 - 2846  | ~$190 - $240  | Yes                | Yes Early 2011 - Mid 2012 | 5460 - 8454  | ~$330 - $520  | Yes                | Yes Mid 2012   - Mid 2015 | 7369 - 10202 | ~$590 - $1120 | No                 | Yes, with some SSDs   Comparing the E7450 to the MBPs, it falls into this weird gap performance-wise between the dual cores and the quad cores with the rMBPs well above what you need, since it's a newer dual core without hyperthreading. Purely for future usability, I'm going to recommend you spend the extra bit and get a lower end quad core.  Note that the performance of the rMBPs actually overlaps the standard MBPs, since they were released simultaneously with the same processors. Besides the upgraded screen and lighter weightâ€“things that seem to be unimportant to youâ€“the early rMBPs seem to offer little advantage, while carrying a price premium, having less I/O, and less upgradability. As such, I'm going to recommend you stay away from them.  Depending on what model you get, you'll probably want to upgrade the RAM and storage to match your reference laptop. Both of these are user serviceable on the unibody MBPs, and can be easily serviced following the appropriate iFixit guide. If you're not using the optical drive, you can also swap it out for a secondary HDD or SSD. Note that there are some issues with SATA III compatibility to be aware of, but these are general non-issues if you're careful.  Note that prices are approximate based on recent eBay sold listings. As with any complete system, finding a reasonable price on a used machine will take some patience and searching on various sites.
So far I've only been able to find two keyboards that fit the bill. I don't have a particular recommendation of one over the otherâ€“they both are from decent but not excellent brands, use slightly funky layouts, are fairly pricy, and look (IMO) fairly poorâ€“but neither are particularly bad options, and I'd recommend you choose on personal preference.  G.Skill KM780 MX - $103.67 / KM780R MX - $83.20 / KM780R MX RGB - $129.99    Cougar 700k - $117.79
Based on the site you linked and the fact that your marked currency is Euros I'm going to assume you live in Spain, so I've recommended computers that could ship to Spain today.  Your linked computer seemed pretty good, but I thought I could maximize the price point further. The desktops I have recommended are capable of blowing any of the latest triple A games or heaviest application development suites out of the water. Each recommendation also doubles the amount of RAM in your configuration to a gratuitous 16 GB (DDR4).  MSI Trident 3 VR7RC-405US â‚¬934,99 @ Newegg   This is the desktop that I purposely chosen to price match your current selection and beat out it's components. This configuration fits in a powerful i7-7700 along with a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060, with 6 GB VRAM making it VR ready. It also comes with 1 TB HDD and a blazing fast 256 GB M.2 SATA SSD. This thing is filled with enthusiast grade goodies so it's probably more than you need, but if you're willing to spend 960â‚¬ on your linked system, you might as well buy this and save that 26â‚¬ for a nice dinner.  ABS Battlebox Essential Vortex Leo â‚¬1.036,99 @ Newegg MSRP: â‚¬1.381,99   Comes armed with a i7-8700K which means you'll have additional control for overclocking scenarios, a 1 TB HDD, and a 240 GB SSD and the aforementioned NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6 GB. In this configuration you're really just paying for that CPU as it is 37% faster according to average user benchmarks drastically outperforming the i7-7700 in multi-core scenarios. I don't expect you to actually use the system to a point where the cpu will bottleneck even if you have a i7-7700 so the extra processing power may not go that far for you unless you plan on overclocking as this processor can be pushed much farther than the i7-7700.    Now since you said you want to game with your configuration and would like some monitor recommendations, here are two 1920x1080 monitors with gratuitously high response times (1ms).  Acer KG1 Series KG221Q â‚¬80,99 @ Newegg MSRP: â‚¬111,99    This is a 21.5" 75 Hz monitor, supports VGA, HDMI, and has 2x2 built in speakers.  Acer GN246HL â‚¬169,99 @ Newegg MSRP: â‚¬171,99    This monitor is a 24" 144Hz monitor that supports D-Sub, DVI, HDMI. This monitor would be a real treat to play video games with due to it's super responsive refresh rate and response time, but comes with a pretty hefty price. This is a monitor that will make your friends jealous.    Final thoughts  To keep your system under your 1.150K budget, I think that you should go with the MSI Trident 3 and Acer GN246HL configuration as this make for a very pleasant experience while being under your max budget by 45.02 â‚¬.
I found two thumb-driven wireless trackballs with tilt wheels that are compatible with Windows:   Logitech MX ERGO ELECOM M-XT3DRBK
I own and use a previously successful Kickstarter campaign product known as the Dacuda Pocket Scanner. The 2014 project resulted in a great working hand-sized device which produces reasonably good output.   My search for a link from which to purchase resulted in failure, as all indications (from Dacuda!) is that they don't and won't make them any more.  Strange enough, a generic search found this PenPower BeeScan device.    It is point for point and feature for feature the same scanner that I have from Dacuda. Off topic, I wonder if there was some intellectual property loss involved in Dacuda's decision to cease production!  My scans usually involve the newspaper and for that purpose it is excellent. As with all newsprint, the reverse shows through, which means I won't post a sample of that type of scan.  Lucky for me, I have one of a day-to-day calendar page which has opaque paper and no reverse bleed-through.    This was possibly a two-scan image, but the unit stitches pieces together very well. Occasionally it is necessary to make a second pass when things get out of kilter. The second pass usually puts them back in kilter.  It is bluetooth coupled to a tablet or phone and has very low latency.  I've snapped off a few photos to show the similarities:
It has PCI-E, and PCI-E is backward compatible, so you can put a PCI-E 16x or 8x card in a lesser speed slot and it will just give a modest impact to performance.   If you don't have faster than a 480Mbps (megabits, not megabytes) internet connection, I'd just go with a USB 2.0 Wireless adapter.   Wireless cards are cheap tech, USB is easier to replace if there is ever a problem, and a USB device will usually have a better antennae to give you a more reliable connection.  It also lets you do things like disconnect from the internet manually or plug it into other devices later on.
You can got a cheep android for Â£55. This can be configured to have a singe button to call you. Use multi users, so admin user configures the phone, and other user can not re-configure. Non-smart are cheaper, some of these will allow you to set a list of numbers that can be called.  Alternatively if you are in a close geographical area, then consider CB. This is a press to talk half-duplex radio system. Half-duplex means you can not listen and speak (or press button) at same-time. Therefore it does require training: If the remote operator keeps the button pressed, while waiting for a response from you, then they can not hear your pleas to release the button. You will also have to check current regulations, and range.   Whatever you do, test it on one device, before buying in bulk.
Here is a list of all the models I looked through â€¦ and there will not be many others, as it's a very small market. So far, nothing that meets the requirements:   Mitel 5624. Technically what you want, but indeed around 500 USD. Rare as well, so not easily available in used condition (I checked eBay). This is reportedly sold under many whitelabeled versions, so possibly one of these is available cheaply, esp. used when bargain hunting on eBay â€¦ but I doubt it):   Mitel 5624 / MiVoice 5624 (source) Unify OpenStage WL3 (source) Alcatel 8118 / Alcatel 8128 (source) (probably there are more)  Siemens OptiPoint WL2 PRO. In addition, a programmer "OpenStage DP1" is needed. Innovaphone IP62. In addition, a base station for programming is needed (art. no. 50-00060-21, source). Unidata INCOM ICW-1000G. Ca. 200 EUR new (source). Ascom i62 Talker. New ca. 320 EUR incl. VAT (source). Sometimes available used via eBay (ca. 120 EUR in one case). In addition, the Ascom DP1 programmer is needed (ca. 140 EUR, source). Nokia with VoWifi feature. Reportedly, some old Nokia mobile phones (and these had hardware keys!) had a feature in their Symbian operating system that allowed to use them as a SIP client on wifi networks. Could not yet confirm this. If so, such phones are still available cheaply, and you could simply operate them without a SIM card. Avaya 3616 / 3626. Cheap (25 EUR used on eBay) but not suitable as it only supports WEP as wifi security mode (source). BlueTinum BT-WFP1000. Not suitable, as it is so old that it only supports WEP as wifi security mode (source). Cisco 7921G / 7921G / 7925G / 7926G. Often cheaply available via eBay (â‰¥20 EUR), but not suitable, as these are not SIP phones. They only support Cisco's propretary SCCP protocol, and there is no wifi SIP phone by Cisco (source).   In short, this class of products looks like a rip-off currently. So either get used to a SIP softphone on an Android smartphone (perhaps with screen pinning to exclusively show the phone app). Or get an IP-DECT based cordless SIP phone. These are available very cheaply used, for example (for Germany) Telekom Sinus 501 V. DECT is often strong enough to only need one access point in a house, and that can be a DECT base station that has just this one purpose, for example the Siemens Gigaset GO-Box 100, available cheaply on eBay. This way you can keep your phone system nicely separate from your router and other network equipment.
You can get any of the routers which support the Tomato Open-source Router Firmware. This firmware includes in it the Transmission BitTorrent client which can do just about anything torrent...  I'd recommend specifically the AdvancedTomato breed of the Tomato firmware which improves a lot in the UI and looks of it.  Here is a list of routers it is available for https://advancedtomato.com/downloads, but if you want good performance take something - at least a bit - powerful. I think that the Netgear R7000 or the ASUS RT-AC66U or pretty good choice.  Below is a screenshot of the BitTorrent Client section if the UI:
TL;DR: Get a Celeron G3900 instead.  Although you are correct in that the Xeon E3-1235L v5 and Xeon E3-1240L v5 have the lowest rated TDP (both at 25W), I would recommend staying away from these processors.  Power consumption  One thing to understand straight away is that under most conditions, the actual power consumption of the process will not be equal to the rated TDP. The rated TDP only measures the maximum thermal output the processor is capableâ€“that is, under full load. For example, the i7-6700K is rated for 91W, but only consumes 3.4W at idle. Note that this does not necessarily scale with rated TDP: the i3-3240 and i7-3770K have vastly different rated TDPs, but both consume roughly the same amount of power at idle.  One thing you've noticed is that L and T series processors can consume significantly less power, even at idle/low load (although I'm not entirely sure what Intel does under the hood to do this.) However, this difference isn't necessarily hugeâ€“especially given their lower performance due to lower clocks.  Given the nature of what you're doing, I wouldn't expect the CPU to be under full load most of the time, and therefore, I don't believe it makes sense to buy an L or T series processor given...  Cost  The cheapest L series v5 Xeon (the E3-1235L v5) has an MSRP of $250.00 (if you can find one at all.) Meanwhile, the Celeron G3900 is only $30.61 with a rated TDP of 51W. At the US average of $0.12/kWh, even at full load, it would take roughly 8 years of continuous usage to offset the cost differential between the two processors. It simply doesn't make sense to buy a more expensive processor.  Compatibility  The final nail in the coffin is that v5 Xeons simply aren't compatible with  motherboards with consumer chipsetsâ€“including B250. While you could get a lower TDP consumer CPU, the price differential (a delta of $67.38 as of right now for the cheapest T series processor, the i3-7100T) probably isn't worth it.
I express my opinion about GPU for a designer and its workstation:  Workstation graphic card is more efficient than gaming series for designing and rendering.  So then I prefer to you buy a workstation series laptop (e.g. in HP workstation ZBook series, In ThinkPad workstation is P or W series and in Dell workstation is precision or latitude series)  NOTE: Don't forget Quadro Nvidia graphics series or FirePro AMD series is more efficient instead of gaming series graphics such as Nvidia GTX.   NOTE: But usually the Quadro series is more expensive.
There's nothing you should get for your MacBook (right now)  In doing my research, I found just two solutions that sort of have what you want. Both also focus on including more I/O, not just the battery. My guess is for a product of this nature, they'll all do this.  Linedock - $299    At 71.61 Whâ€“146% of the MacBook 13" built-in batteryâ€“this thing packs a pretty hefty punch. However, your wallet will also feel it. Compared to other "dumb" battery banks with similar capacity, it's a hefty price to pay. Sure, you get more I/O and (optionally) storage and a great form factor, but that's a lot of $$$. Note also that, while shaped like the MacBook, it is not a case and does not sit flush with the MacBook, and is much closer to a pad than a case.  Finally, note that this is an Indiegogo project, and so far, doesn't seem to have any reputable reviews or even confirmation of shipments as far as I can tell; it hasn't even finished shipping to backers. There's really no way I can recommend you buy this product at this stage.  DEC    It's a beautiful product by a reputable manufacturer that basically does what the Linedock does, but better. Only issue: it really doesn't exist yet. There's no pricing, specs, or even delivery date. While at least one prototype was created, it did not include a battery. You can't preorder it, and there's no way I'd recommend you do.  Random battery banks?  Unfortunately, as far as I could find, there aren't any plain battery banks that are even close to the form factor of a MacBook. Even sites making recommendations specifically for the MacBook at best just end up recommending slim battery banks like this Aukey model, and unless you want to carry one separately rather than affixed to your device, I can't seriously recommend one.
Probably the Node 202 based on price, but making your own could be pretty cool.  Although really it depends how much you care about size vs. cost vs. your own time, since you're not exactly trying to cram a lot of hardware in.  Compatibility  Looking at an overhead view of the motherboard, it clearly shares the same mounting holes as mITX.      So any case with mITX supportâ€“such as any one from the the 15 pages hereâ€“will work. Not sure what case you were trying that didn't work; most cases these days have support for mITX.  Off the shelf cases  The thing about a case is that it's ultimately a matter of taste, and I can't decide that for you. With that, I'm going to provide a range of good cases and let you choose what you like. Most of this is copied from my previous answer here.  Very small cases  These cases are generally described as "artisan": made by specialized companies in low volumes, with extremely good build quality, at extremely high prices.  Dr. Zaber Sentry  $235 (TBD), 6.9L, 305mm video card, 5x2.5", SFX-L PSU    It's the epitome of a very small case: extremely expensive, extremely tiny, extremely good build quality (primaily powder coated steel), pretty good compatibility with a few things to keep in mind, and runs a bit hot, but generally extremely good. One big issue though: you can't buy one. They're apparently targeting Q1 2018, but for now, I can't recommend what you can't buy.  NFC Skyreach 4 MINI  $199, 5.0L, 215mm video card, 2x2.5", special  It's the smallest case in this category. Note that video card compatibility is very limited, drive mounting is limited, and most of all, PSU compatibility is virtually nil, with only two PSUs listed (a $95 400W DC-DC and a $58 200W DC-DC); however, these should be non-issues for you.    DAN A4-SFX  $255 (TBD), 7.2L, 295mm video card, 3x2.5", SFX-L    You like shoeboxes? I like shoeboxes! Made under contract by Lian-Li of mostly aluminum, it's (IMO) the prettiest case on this list. But again, it's not for sale yet (just preorders), and I can't recommend what you can't buy.  Pretty small cases  These cases are a step up in size from the very small cases, and benefits to match. These are largely cheaper, easier to work with, have better support, and are actually available to purchase!  NCASE M1  $195, 12.6L, 317mm video card, 3x3.5" + 3x2.5", ATX (SFX-L highly recommended)   The sort of "daddy" of small cases, the NCASE M1 is the last artisan case on this list, and one of the older ones here. It has incredible support for hardware (even a slimline optical drive!), while being spacious enough to keep things from getting too toasty.  Fractal Design Node 202  $80 or $130 with a 450W PSU, 10.2L, 310mm video card, 2x2.5", SFX-L  It's an extremely popular choice, and a good one! Nothing stands out really except for the very reasonable price.  Silverstone FTZ01 RVZ01, RVZ02, and RVZ03  $85 to $130, 14L, 330mm video card, 1x3.5" + 2-4x2.5", SFX-L  All very similar with nothing too stand out; the RVZ03 trades the slimline optical slot and 3.5" mount for an extra 4x2.5" mount and RGB lighting.       Silverstone ML08  $70, 12L, 330mm video card, 2x2.5", SFX-L    It's literally based on the RVZ02, but smaller, cheaper, less drive mounting, and with an optional handle!  Honorable mention  The Silverstone SG05 and Silverstone SG06 are neat too, but much boxier. The Fractal Design Array R2, Lian-Li Q09, Raidmax Element, SilverStone SG07 and SG08, and Xigmatek Eris EN6305 are no longer in production, though they would make perfectly good boxes if you can find them.  Not as small cases  They're bigger with support for more things! They're also much quieter. Carrying handles are a must here, since you said that regular transport was an integral part to this build. These cases seem to have largely fallen out of favor as smaller cases take over the mITX sector, but I've put them here anyways.  BitFenix Prodigy  $60, 26.4L, 317mm video card, 5x3.5", ATX    HardwareCanucks put it best: It's a beautiful chassis at a great price with a few minor compromises for that goal.  Honorable mentions  The Corsair 380T is a great case, but unfortunately, it no longer appears to be in production, and second hand prices for it are absurd. The Silverstone CS01B is also rather neat, but the 190mm max video card length kills any recommendation. The Cougar QBX and Fractal Design Define Nano S are beautiful and compact, but too large to not have a carrying handle and still be intended as portable IMO.  Your own case  The great thing about building a PC is that you're free to use whatever components you'd like, including building your own! Because you're not trying to cram a lot of hardware in, if you're really bent on getting the smallest case possible, it might be worth looking at rolling your own. The off-the-shelf cases are created with the intention of being used with more "normal" motherboards and usually have to accommodate a PSU and GPUâ€“things that aren't issues in your case. mITX is an open standard, and it doesn't take much to make a basic case.
https://www.dell.com/en-us/gaming/alienware-laptops?~ck=mn  Alienware has gaming laptops which have the best GPU.  https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-alienware-17/spd/alienware-17-laptop/dkcwcflg044  You could contact them if you wanted more, but cost goes through the roof.
I've had this backpack a while ago and I think it has a special compartment for a laptop which is made out of a protective material. It has many more compartments, only bad thing is that the biggest laptop it can fit in it is 15.6". I've carried 25ibs in it with no problem, though I've never tried carrying 50ibs. It is a bit over your budget(60$ on the official page) but you can probably find it for less on Amazon or sites like that.
If not for the price limit I would've told you to go with at-least something like the MSI GT63 TITAN-046, which is over $2500... Or even this Asus ROG STRIX for $1,719.  For your budget, though I think the best you can get is the Acer Predator with an NVIDIA GTX 1070. Available in both a 15-inch screen size as well as a 17-inch model.
I think your problem is probably more price range than anything else.  The touchscreen monitor is the expense, and takes up a large portion of your budget. For instance, this one takes up half your budget, and it's an inexpensive option by your requirements.  Another one takes up much more.  Windows 8 - 10 has the ability to run as a Kiosk, and you can find some tutorials to teach you how to set it up that way.  This will handle your worries about user access.   You may wish to consider the less expensive option of using QR Codes.  QR codes next to your product allows anyone with a smartphone that can read a barcode (which is pretty much all of them) to auto-link to a website of your choosing.  Ideally, this is your website that has been programmed, made adaptive to mobile, and hosted for you, to which your in-store screens would probably have been pointing, anyway.  This gives you less to maintain, less up-front expense, and when bored children start playing with screens, it will be their own screens or those of their parents and not your expensive product terminals.
You may wish to look into optimized hardware for this specific purpose.   I see that you're remoting into the other computer and attempting to game that way or watch video; that's going to be a nightmare most of the time.    That's because when you remote in through standard means, your connection being limited to your network bandwidth is a bit much for the various security plugins, I/O handlers, etc. that are involved.  A lot more is going on through the network traffic to keep your connection going, because both computers are doing all of their respective computery things as well as maintaining that link and passing your input back to the host.   This is why devices like the Steam Link exist. It's not perfect, and I've had some connection drops if my network has too many WiFi users at once, but it's a better solution than what you're doing and pretty inexpensive.  It also works with games and apps that aren't purchased through Steam (by adding them to Steam's app manager).  It also supports a wired connection, and plugs directly into any monitor or TV that has HDMI connections.  You can use a keyboard and mouse with it, any given controller with it, or the Steam Controller that is a little odd but enjoyable when you get used to it.    I have one in my living room and one in my bedroom, and no longer miss having a gaming laptop instead of a desktop.   Edit: To explain more specifically, your problem isn't your video card, as your host is still handling the video processing unless you're running the executable off a network share to the host.  The problem is your general method of remoting to the host.
Anker 4-Port USB 3.0 Ultra-Slim Portable Data Hub with 12W Power Adapter - $16.99    Based on the fact that your HDD is intended to work with simply a single USB 2.0 port, I'm going to assume that it's simply a bit of a power consumption issue and a simple powered USB hub will fix your issues. There's a wide variety of USB hubs available, but this one is by a reputable manufacturer, comes in a nice form factor, works with or without power, uses USB to deliver additional power, supports USB 3.0, and is fairly cheap.
Switch emulation isn't quite a thing yet, but Nintendo has always been pretty emulation-friendly as far as minimum requirements.     Your target software is probably the Dolphin emulator, since it covers a breadth of Nintendo emulators.    NES, GB, GBC, and SNES (including SGB adaptation) are simple emulation on any modern machine, and it won't really matter what you have. I wouldn't recommend less than an i5 processor for N64, GBA, or 3DS. A 1050Ti should be just fine as far as video card here.    When you get into the GC, Wii, and Wii-U, you're going to need more RAM. An i7 or higher-end AMD processor wouldn't be a bad idea, either.  Emulating these systems is significantly more demanding and usually has hooks that make use of your hardware a bit more instead of just isolated emulation.  I got almost flawless performance in all games up through the GC and some Wii games on an i7-2600k with 16GB of RAM and a GTX 760, so your hardware picks should still be fine.    Seeing as you can get an i7 for not much more than an i5 these days, I'd definitely go that route.
As I said earlier if you are going to choose from your list the Dell XPS configuration is best positioned to suit your needs as it has the best processor among your choices. However, I think that it is a bit overvalued, and thus; I was able to beat out your prices.  Here are some laptops you could purchase today that are more than enough for programming and computing. I also fit in some pretty decent desktop GPUs since I'm not really close to stretching your budget. Each option includes a 1 TB HDD, and blazing fast 128 GB NVMe SSDs. You could also play triple A games on these laptops without two much trouble, so heavy 3D game development should be a breeze on these laptops.  I believe that the shipping for the laptops are free, and as far as I could tell there shouldn't be any customs import fees.  MSI GL62M 7RDX-NE1050i5 $899.99 CAD (MSRP: $1,049.99)     Discrete NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2 GB GDDR5 i5 7300HQ, you can Upgrade to the i7 variant for +$150 8 GB Memory   This laptop should meet your needs if you're looking to save money. The i7 variant of this computer will give you about 47% more multi-core performance according to user benchmarks and may be worth the upgrade for your usage scenario.  MSI GL Series GL63 8RC-068 $1,469.99 CAD (MSRP: $1,499.99)     GeForce GTX 1050 4 GB GDDR5 i7 8750H 16 GB Memory   This option has a lot more RAM that you are unlikely to come close to filling up unless you like running multiple virtual machines alongside a heavy IDE, even then you won't fill that up. The i7 8750H benchmarks suggests that it will outperform the i7 7700HQ by 31% in general use scenarios and 53% in multi-core scenarios making it the better option for heavy computing. In addition, should you want it, you can select this configuration to have a GTX 1050 Ti for +$130 dollars if you feel so inclined. The benchmarks for the 1050 Ti suggest an improvement of about +14% in FPS over the non-titan variant.
Much of the problem you could probably solve with a virtual machine, but graphics will remain an issue.  On a VMware esxi server you can dedicate any device to a specific VM.  However, that means you need drivers for it.  In which case you would have to get an older video cards that support 98,9x,or etc.  Windows 9x only support 4gb of RAM so if you have 8gb it should be enough.  SSD will take care of any hard drive lagging.  IF your looking to build a hardware based system you will have to go to ebay and second hand stores to get components.
For a 2018 answer, the BlackBerry KEY2.  Specs   A great physical keyboard, which doubles as a trackpad for scrolling, navigation, and text selection, and allows for custom programmable macros to instantly launch anything Android Oreo 8.1 SnapDragon 660, Kryo 260 8-Core @ 2.2 GHz x 4 + 1.8GHz x 4 and 6GB RAM   As for your nice-to-haves:   Can be rooted (e.g. CyanogenMod) 1080p screen (433 PPI) 3500 mAh of battery (~25 hrs of mixed use) OS will likely get feature updates (KEYone Oreo updates are rolling out at the time of writing)   Unfortuantely it fails your "Supported on the Verizon network" requirement, since it's GSM/GPRS/EDGE, but Verizon only supports CDMA. I hope it's not still a deal-breaker to transfer to a GSM provider like T-Mobile or AT&T.
Here's a fairly detailed write up I did a while back for someone looking for something similar to what you want, recommending the "Anne Pro":  https://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/a/7633/6475  I'll go through your list to address your needs specifically:   Brown Switches = Yes Mac Keys - Yes. The board has four layout profiles; one of them is dedicated for Mac and the other is fully customize-able including Mac key functions. The keyboard comes with Windows printed keycaps but they are standard size so finding keycaps with the Mac print on them should be easy enough. Construction - This category is a mixed bag with the Anne. It's plate mounted, has quality keycaps, and feels / sounds sturdy despite the plastic housing. I will say the stabilizers can be a little rattly out of the box, mine was enough that I spent maybe 3-5 hours finding and performing modifications to resolve the issue. I'll be happy to provide more info on my specific mods if you'd like, but it was less than $10 in materials and I'm very happy with the result. So it's not perfect but it's certainly something you can work with. Driver - There isn't an app or anything but Anne Pro works out of the box with MacOS. There are apps for Windows 7/8/10, Android, and iOS that you can use to customize the lighting and key layout. Numpad - No dice, this is a 60% board so it does not feature a numpad or dedicated arrow keys. I have my Fn button set to the CAPS LOCK key, and arrows bound to the function layer at WASD and IJKL, this layout works extremely well. Yes I miss the numpad, I will likely end up buying or building a mechanical one to pair with the Anne Pro at some point. Programmable RGB - Yes. There are a few dynamic light modes as well. Programmable RGB layouts are only possible as a static layout, you can't currently make custom dynamic layouts (though this feature is supposedly coming with the 1.5 firmware promised over a year ago, sooooo yea). The only other thing about the firmware that blows is that the on-board macros don't work, but I assume you can live without that since you didn't list it in your post. USB hub - The Anne doesn't have one of these unfortunately.   So it's got just about everything aside from the numpad and the USB hub. Amazon usually has them for ~$60. It may cost you an extra $5-10 and a half a Saturday morning to get it where you want it, but you might be really happy with it right out of the box too. I'd recommend reading the answer I linked as it addresses some aspects of the board that weren't listed in your post in greater detail. There's also a dedicated community on reddit for this keyboard, so you can swing by over there to get a feel for common problems / solutions and popular modifications.  If you have other questions about this board feel free to ask and I'll edit in my responses. Best of luck with the search!
Last time I checked, Photoshop is not available on Linux, but I am assuming you're planning to use it on your Windows OS. I would recommend the following, based on my experience:   System76 laptops pre-configured OR design-your-own (e.g. Serval WS, Oryx Pro, Galago Pro...) Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition ASUS ZenBook 13 Ultra-Slim Laptop Dell Precision 5520 HP ZBook 15u G3 Mobile Workstation   For more choices:   The latest official list of Ubuntu compatible laptops Ubuntu laptops on Amazon   Related question: https://askubuntu.com/q/919794/490067  Source:  I am a Full Stack developer (.NET, Java &, Python), Photographer, Microsoft Certified Professional, a decade-long Linux user and a decade-long WordPress blogger. I have used all the technologies you have listed. I am using Lenovo V570 for last 7 yrs, which I have upgraded on my own. Plus, I've built me a desktop recently.
I would recommend the following, almost all of these come with Ubuntu/Debian/fork installed by manufacturer :   System76 Galago Pro Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition Dell Precision 5520 HP ZBook 15u G3 Mobile Workstation - listed on Ubuntu website   For more choices, I recommend looking at the latest official list of Ubuntu compatible laptops  Related questions:   https://askubuntu.com/q/919794/490067 What laptop should I buy?

If you do not require video level synchronization, you may be able to accomplish your objective by using a pair of Canon low-cost point-and-shoot cameras. I have a pair of mid-range Canon SX-200 IS cameras with USB connectors wired to a trio of 1.5v batteries and a switch.  The cameras have been loaded with Canon CHDK which is stored on the camera's SD card. It can be configured for auto-loading or manual activation (which I use) and has a tremendous script library. I've forgotten which feature I use that allowed the battery pack to trip the cameras, or if I needed it at all. I think I did, though.  The cameras are plugged into the battery pack. When the switch is held, it performs the auto-focus sequence, then when the switch is released, it trips the shutter on all the cameras plugged into the pack.   If you search for "trigger canon camera with usb" many results are available. My search results showed me that CHDK is needed to allow this feature.
Kinect for X-Box One is significantly higher-performing than the version for the 360 unit.   No matter what your version, there is an adapter cable available which converts the connection to USB and supplies power, and Windows already contains the Drivers for it.  There are various pieces of software which can use it, ranging from basic webcam software to the Kinect Studio and 3D Scan.   You should be aware that both versions of Kinect, and their adapter cables, have been discontinued by Microsoft; the adapter for the X-Box One version was discontinued in January 2018.   If you wish to obtain these without buying from the secondary market, I recommend moving quickly.
You need something like this, where the computer is an all-in-one unit.  This pricing isn't too bad considering what it is, and you don't have a ton of options.  Note that it doesn't have video inputs for the monitor portion of the unit, so it does not classify as a television.   This model also has a touch-screen, so no need for a keyboard and mouse.
I Think you're looking for something like one of the following:  1) TP-Link M7350 Mobile Router   2) Huawei E5577   Bonus: If you're not on a tight budget here's one of my favorites the Netgear AC810-100.  Hope this helps.
The PCx-xxxxx stand for:   PC3 (DDR3) --> RAM Type xxxxx --> BUS max transmission data rate (per channel)   Answering your question, the PC3-12800 has a max trans. rate of 12,8GB/s, on the other hand, the PC3-14900 has a transmission rate of 14,9GB/s  With that being said, it goes down only on your choice/budget and on your need.  If you're planning to use virtualization software, light gaming or more generally "RAM-eater" software (i.e. Audio/Video/Photo Editing...), I will go for the PC-14900, BUT if you're going to upgrade your ram because you're going short on the number of programs you can open at the same time, take this a personal thought, I will go with the PC-12800 one...  Hope this clears your doubt.
As far as I know there is no extender which will permit you to do the login. If the WiFi mode is bridge the extender will be transparent and You will have no problem with web authentication (per device - laptop, tablet, smartphone).  Moreover the hotel policies are usually "One device per account (user/password)"
Self-built option ~= $1600 (Prices fluctuate daily)  If you're comfortable with building your own systems (It's actually quite easy) I can easily fit it top of the line components for $1594.69. Here's a PC Part Picker list that shows you where you can buy every single component. Also if you choose to tweak the build a bit more yourself, it has a compatibility filter to make sure everything fits. Specifically this build has:   i7-8700k overclockable processor DDR4-3000 15 CAS latency Memory *(8700k supports 2666, but you can overclock it, you can buy a cheaper memory module otherwise, I would recommend the lowest timings) 300GB 10000RPM HDD Samsung 970 Evo 250GB M.2 SSD GeForce GTX 1080 8GB   I also gave you a Titanium Certified power supply for those energy savings, and included a thermal paste recommendation -Thermal Grizzly - Kryonaut - which is one of the best ceramic thermal pastes out there.  I cannot reccomend self-building enough, as it is the most effective way to decrease cost of a PC.  Here's a link to the build in case you missed it above.    Pre-built option: ABS Battlebox Ultimate Bearcat $1,649.99 (MSRP: $1,849.99)    Features high end components such as:   NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti 11 GB Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700K 16 GB DDR4 2 TB HDD 240 GB SSD   This monster of a computer will remain competitive for years to come with it's top of the line features. While not as great a value as self-building should absolutely smoke your old hardware out of the water.
You can use a notebook where WiFi/BT module can be easily removed. Examples include: Toshiba U925t Ultrabook, most (if not all) HP contemporary notebooks (just to mention few). IMO most of the contemporary notebooks use the same interface for WiFi/BT module which mean you can remove it on most of them. Just for the record for most of notebooks removing this module means you need to disassemble it in some degree.  Combining this hardware with MS Windows BitLocker (for an encrypted filesystem) and encrypted container based on Veracrypt or PGP disk as second level can do what you want. If you are not a fan of MS (almost) any Linux distribution has disk encryption for entire disk and can be combined also with Veracrypt/PGP Here is a image how this module looks like:   Edit: Some notebooks (Dell, not sure about the model) have hardware switch to go in "Airplane mode" which cut off all the wireless communications. This switch can be used to permanently disable WiFi/BT
Sounds like an old Palm PDA e.g. m130. Tools for exception see e.g.: https://www.techrepublic.com/article/protect-your-pdas-with-these-encryption-options/
It's unlikely there are any HDDs with an embedded controller without firmware upgrade feature, though this upgrade feature need not be documented - the firmware developers will want to have access, too.   But if you are doing reverse engineering, why not use a reverse engineered HDD firmware, and disable the upgrade feature yourself? Of course, you better don't make a mistake in this, because you'll have only one shot ...  And on the subject of mobo firmware: There's plenty of places where there's firmware you won't expect (management engine, embedded controllers, network controllers, wifi controllers, ...) and you'll have to lock all of those down, too...
Basically all routers which you can flash with open-source router firmware (OpenWRT, Tomato, ...) will be able to do this. Once it's open source you can install any program you like, and there are plenty of torrent clients with commandline or web interfaces.
Basically all routers where you can install open source firmware (OpenWRT, Tomato, ...) will be able to do this. However, you'll need some familiarity with Linux to set this up (or you need to know someone who does). University networks use EAP (as shown), and wpa_supplicant which is the standard WPA authorization client supports this, given the correct configuration file (where you'd also enter username and password).  Now enable NAT (which should be the default), and you have your hotspot.
Idea (haven't done this myself): Buy a dedicated outdoor router that supports power over ethernet (e.g. from Ubiquity or TP-Link). Those routers should already be at least somewhat weatherproof. Fix at top of mast, run ethernet cable through mast, add power-over-ethernet device somewhere in cabin. Connect to another router (which will create a hotspot, or provide LAN ports) inside as desired.
The website geizhals.eu lists a few dozen dual-band routers in your price range. E.g. the TP-Link Archers are typical low-budget routers.  In principles, all routers should be able to handle 16 devices "simultaneously" (in the sense of "all connected at the same time, time-sharing the channel, possibly being in separate MIMO channels). No router you'll find today will handle 16 totally independent MIMO channels, if that's what you you mean by ""simultaneously". And if there was such a router, it would be much more expensive than 40 EUR.  In your place I'd also stay way from the Mi firmware - Xiomi sells stuff cheap so they can make money in other ways.
My personal experience is based on WD EX4 with 4 WD 7200rpm 4TB disks in RAID5. Yes, there is noise. Especially when I run some task on the NAS itself (downloading, extracting huge archive, export a lot of images, copy huge amount of information). But even with such noise I have no problem to sleep in the next room (with open door between the rooms). Of course the sensitivity to such noise is something very personal, but my opinion is it's not a problem.  BTW enterprise grade HDD are much more noisy (they are created for reliability) and I will not advise to add such disks in home NAS.
The Replicant project aims at creating a completely free, non-proprietary build of Android for certain devices. They still do have wireless radios, but using them requires non-free firmware, which Replicant doesn't provide. Effectively, the device cannot communicate wirelessly. For example Samsung Galaxy Nexus is supported, but without working WiFi and Bluetooth. Just remove SIM card and cellular radio will also be useless.
Go to the xFinity retail device finder. I use the Motorola that is listed and it is great. Bought it at Best Buy and I do not pay any rental fee. I pay for the 200 Mbps service but get close to 250 Mbps most of the time.
You didn't mention your location, but here are some options that ship free to UK (I used the zip code of Buckingham palace). You might also notice that I am only giving you Amazon links. This is because that is the only EU friendly purveyor I am familiar with as North American based companies will get hit with tax importation and VAT.  Recommended Option: Cooler Master MasterLiquid Lite Â£38 (MSRP: Â£45)   So I know you asked specifically for a fan upgrade, but I wanted to recommend a cheap water cooling system as they are quieter than your traditional CPU fan and also more efficient at removing heat from your processor than your average fan. This water cooler is rated at 8 dBA which according to the decibel scale chart is quieter than a ticking watch. Also according to your extra requirement, you     hope to find someone here who has done this himself, and can share the brand and model for which it worked.   This just so happened to be the exact cooler I helped to install on a friend's LGA 1155 processor. I can also tell you it's very quiet.  Non water cooling option: ARCTIC - Alpine 11 Plus Â£9.8 (MSRP: Â£12)    According to it's page on PC Part Picker, it has a noise profile of 14.0 db, and it's American Amazon page, a maximum of 23 db, which puts it at about the same volume as "rustling leaves".    Thermal Paste Recommendation: Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Â£7    One of the best ceramic thermal pastes out there. Also happens to be the exact thermal paste I used with the Cooler Master upgrade on the LGA 1155 socket. As a reminder, you may want to buy some Isopropyl alcohol (nail polish remover) to help clean off the original thermal paste. Also remember you don't need to put a lot of thermal paste on the CPU to get it to work.
The way I've solved this problem in the past is with the PC's line-in jack.  While it requires the PC to have power to output sound, it allows you to chain the output.  You may need to go into the sound device manager for your PC's operating system and toggle the Line-In jack to get this to work, but you should only have to do that once.  Some computers combine their microphone jack with line-in, but most have a separate input jack.  This is a problem, however, if you are using sound from both at once.  If your computer is also making sounds, you may need to mute applications on the PC or you will hear both at once.    An alternative is a switching box, but most that have wireless control are HDMI-only.  HDMI carries audio, so if you can switch to that interface for these devices and have multiple ports on your home theatre receiver or TV, that might be the better option altogether.
That mobo will support up to 2933Mhz out o' the box, which is about right for 3000Mhz RAM (it's just more honest about what 3kMhz looks like in the math).    AMD compatible is really just a marketing thing, in that AMD specifically tested models using that memory to get the speeds they're reporting, and have confirmed it works with Ryzen's RAM-scaling features.  It is more like an endorsement than anything else. Anything 288-pin and DDR4 should do the job.  High-end memory exists mostly for those who plan to overclock that memory. G.Skill makes amazing RAM and I've been using them to obtain ridiculous overclocks on RAM since my old Athlon X2, but if you're planning to run stock speeds, they're overkill.    Corsair is a great mid-to-high range product that can be obtained inexpensively by comparison.   This Corsair Vengeance kit costs $100 less and will likely get you the results you want. Also, IIRC, Corsair's warranty extends to even if you overclock it later.   It did when I used them on my first i7.
Get a passive Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable, like this one  As SiXandSeven8ths mentioned, DisplayPort++ (also known as Dual Mode) is a technology that allows DisplayPort to put out another signal for use with passive adapters. While limited because of this unidirectionality, it's an incredibly cheap, easy, and effective solution for what you're trying to do. Though it's difficult to confirm with your third laptop, almost all laptops with Mini DisplayPort support this mode because of its extreme popularity and utilityâ€“even when not indicated, like on the XPS 13.    One thing worth noting is the Thunderbolt 3 connection on your third laptop. Thunderbolt 3 (and USB-C, which can also carry a DisplayPort connection) cannot utilize DisplayPort++ because it lacks the necessary pin count to do so.  While your solution of using a USB to VGA graphics adapter works, I would advise against this in the future. VGA is a much more limited connection, namely in that it is an analog rather than a digital signal.
I will offer you to check those devices: Synology DiskStation DS918+, Qnap TS-453A-4G. They support all you want. If you have bigger needs for disk space you can check next models Qnap TS-653A-4G, Qnap TS-853A-4G (with 6 / 8 HDD) and Synology DiskStation DS1517+, Synology NAS DiskStation DS1817+ (with 5 / 8 HDD)  But do not expect super power for virtual machines and heavy load for MySQL server
I would wait. FINALLY, it is more than a rumor that a new gaming architecture is coming. nVidia has a talk titled 'NVIDIAâ€™s Next Generation Mainstream GPU' at the HotChips conference next month. Also, they are sending out invites to GamesCon on August 21 for a 'PC related event'. Yes that is a gaming conference. Read about it at The Verge here.  Other than that, if you really cannot wait or think you want to spend the money on the next generation, I would keep a hawk eye out for a 1080 Ti. I have already seen a couple of deals around $750 that disappear quickly. If new hardware really does come out and you keep looking, jump on one that is below your $700 threshold. It will happen  1080 Ti would be future proof for you. It will do 60 FPS with all setting on high and 1080P and you can even get 45-60 FPS with most setting high at 4K if you ever go there.
If you want the phone to be the host and charge you may be unable to find such a device.  I am not familiar with USB-C but in OTG specification it is impossible to power a device with it being the host - the current can only flow from the host to the device. When designing devices there are often safeguards against precisely the thing you are trying to achieve.  If you want to charge your phone with it being the USB device any hub which allows external power will do.
Not sure how opposed to used things you are and/or where you live. I've taken the liberty of converting 1500 euros to 1750 USD. If you're willing to manually instal the requisite software and don't mind used parts, you can 'expect super power for virtual machines and heavy load for MySQL server', as said by Romeo Ninov.  Off of a quick ebay search, I found the dell R720XD server at $1069 + shipping. That comes to specifications of    2x Xeon E5-2650v2 CPUs (Passmark score of 13k * 2 for 26k total) 32GB RAM 12 drive bays iDRAC7 (for remote management) PERC H710 (for RAID)   You can then purchase 9 of these drives, for example, for 27TB or storage, or 21TB after RAID 6 is applied, which can be done through the RAID card, and that totals to $571.50 + $1069 = $1,640.50 + shipping
If you're looking for Surface pro's here are some options. Both have 8 gb of memory and 256 gb SSD. I would stay away from the 4 gb options as they are going to page to RAM a lot (be laggy).  Microsoft Surface Pro 2 - USED ($399.99)    The specific processor is not listed, but according to the Wikipedia page it is either the i5-4200 U or i5-4300 U variant depending on it's manufacture date.  Microsoft Surface Pro 3 - Refurbished ($484.99)    Features an i5-4300 U. You may want to consider this option as the tablet has, likely, underwent much less wear than the first option. Refurbished laptops are usually open-box returns, floor models, etc. I've never had problems with refurbished laptops. In fact I'm currently typing this answer on a MSI-GS60 ghost that still has an Activision sticker on it (first buyer, who obviously returned the laptop).    Microsoft 3mm Surface Touch Cover Magnetic Keyboard ($25.99)  It looks like none of the used or refurbished options came with a keyboard. This means you'll have to buy your own. This is the super thin keyboard that I remember seeing on these models back in the day. If you want the beefier chiclet keyboard option that your probably thinking of I've taken the liberty of scouting out one for $39.99, but is the horrendous cyan version, as well as the $49.50 a black version that doesn't assault the eyes should you choose to splurge a bit.
The real question is:  What do you need it for?  CPU  I wouldn't really care about the processor, as long as you don't do anything requiring an intensive processing power.   You can find a lot of cpu comparing sites by searching on any search engine "cpu compare" or "cpu benchmark".  Storage  The SSD will gargantuanly benefit the performance. The computer will start faster, the programs will start faster, everything will be faster. But with 250GB you may not have enough space, depending on what you do. Do you store photos, videos and bigger files on your computer or do you use cloud services? If you don't, with time you may run out of space without an external hard disk. Meanwhile, the 1TB hard disk will give you a lot of space.  Also, could you post the specific model of processors in your post? I don't yet have enough reputation to comment.  Edit:  I've used this website and Intel's official catalogue of products for a comparison, take a look as they are very helpful.  The main difference between the 2 is the number of cores. The 7th generation one got 2 cores while the 8th generation one got 4 (I'm talking about physical cores, not thread or "virtual" cores). Remember that they are both low-end cores, so you may have problems calculating, as you said in the comments, macros or data in number of millions, with both of the computers. Still on a Windows environment an SSD will be a greater advantage compared to a slower-quad core processor, as Windows is very resource demanding when talking about hard disks speeds (I'm looking at you Cortana).
You mentioned that the UPS systems you looked at were far too pricey and bulky, so my guess is that it is likely you were looking at production grade systems. Based on the specs you issued, the cheapest systems I can find are going to be around $100. Both systems also come with supplementary software that can communicate with Windows, Mac, and Linux and I believe, provide soft shutdown options.  CyberPower Ecologic EC850LCD $86.95 (MSRP: $97.99)     510 Watt power rating 850 Volt-Amperes Battery Run-time on full load: 1 minute Dimensions: 12.20" x 7.00" x 3.10" 7.70 lbs.   This UPS system's form factor is going to be about 2-3 power strips based on it's dimensions.  CyberPower Intelligent LCD UPS CP1000AVRLCD $109.95     600 Watt power rating 1000 Volt-Amperes Battery Run-time on full load: 2 Minutes Dimensions: 8.75" x 4.25" x 10.50" 15.90 lbs.   If you have the money to spend, consider this option as this will be better equipped to handle the 600 W maximimum specification you asked for. As far as form factor, the site claims the UPS system to be about the size of a "Mini-Tower", so this one will be the size of a tiny desktop computer.
As it happens, it turns out that typing out the question was the impetus I needed to properly think about what I was looking for. Turns out the search term I needed to be looking for was "male to female USB cable", which brings back results for "USB extension cable". I could have sworn I'd already tried searching for the latter, but either way, Amazon lists several.
You can use Hushme's stenomask:   http://www.gethushme.com preorder only price: 189 USD
Chromebooks can run Android apps, the problem with that is that you will see more frequent updates of apps and Skype for example is quite big for what it does (~150MB). If you are lucky you may notice that updates get smaller with newer operating systems like Chrome OS, Windows 10 or Fedora which should be able to use delta compression and only download the new bits. At least Fedora should be able to do that with DeltaRPMs which it uses by default. I don't know how it plays out for flatpak updates or Silverblue though.
The Free Software Foundation has made a list of GNU/Linux compatible hardwares, freely editable by anyone with an account, which can be found here:  https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw  Then after going to that website go to H-node's search (H-node is the directory of FOSS hardware):  https://h-node.org/  And go to scanners category:  https://h-node.org/scanners/catalogue/en  As of August 2018, the list of scanners with full compatibility with free software has 6 models with commercialization dates between 2002 and 2011.
Having had a very similar use-case, I highly recommend Ubiquiti EdgeMax Routers for managing your network.  They are high quality options (with some nice security and resource delegation features) and have many models that support Power Over Ethernet on at least one port.  They also work well when establishing the kind of subnets you are talking about. I've used one in combination with my modem to form a gateway for quite some time. Just a couple of $60 models to separate the concerns of managing the two different networks (so that a problem with one doesn't mean a problem with the other) and to allow isolation of the network you don't want reachable by guests would do the trick. This also gives the option of setting up two subnets for your networks if you get three routers, all for under $200 together.  They're also usually about the size of a cell phone.  I was running this through a mid-range Asus router, but it failed as an AP unless I also allowed it to run its own subnet and function as a router.  Even then, reliability was sketchy.   I recently replaced it with an Ubiquiti AP-Pro, which supports both bands under one network ID.  It has its own software for managing access and has an option for activation and management of a guest network with restrictions as to what guests may do.   The unit is weather-resistant and is designed to be wall- or ceiling-mounted if you like, so it's possible to even mount them externally. It also has a second ethernet port for bridging or connecting a computer directly to the wired connection, making it easy to chain multiple across a house instead of setting up a mesh network or configuring the device to repeat a signal and lose bandwidth.  I currently use only one of these on my second floor of my 5000 sq ft home; a direct connected device consistently gets nearly 1Gb/s speeds on the internet (which is max 1Gb/s), a wireless-AC connection one floor down usually gets 500Mb/s minimum, and my son's connection across the house never drops below 200Mb/s.  The unit cost me about $90 as it connects to the PoE on the router for power, but you can get an injector for about $20 if you need to supply power another way.    3x Ubiquiti EdgeMax = $180 (because this gets you DHCP 3x and separates your APs entirely based on network)  3x Ubiquiti AC-Pro = $270-340 (depending on power connection and presuming you need more than one due to geography)  4x Decent wall Surge Suppressor (if you hook up your units with PoE Injectors instead of normal PoE) = $80  Huge spool of Cat5e (6 is a waste for 1Gb and down) = $80  Crimping Tool = $30 (because crimping your own cables is infinitely cheaper in the long haul)  Ethernet plug headers = $10  Total: $650 - $720
According to Dell's memory upgrade tool here are some RAM sticks you can purchase. According to the Intel spec sheet for your processor, you can support up to 32 gb split across 2 slots (16 each). I extracted the memory specs from their sheets to find RAM that will be compatible with your computer. I was only able to find RAM with CAS latency of 15. Since your laptop has two slots, if you keep your current RAM in the first slot, you'll have 12 gb of RAM which should be more than enough for your usage scenarios.  I've recommended RAM that should ship within India for free (I used the zip code of New Delhi)  You have your choice between Kingston and Crucial. They're pretty much the same price and the same from a technical standpoint. You have the luxury of picking the brand you feel more comfortable with.

I ended up buying the Rolls MX51S Mini Mix 2 Four-Channel Stereo Line Mixer. It cost more than twice what I wanted to spend, but I couldn't find anything cheaper that supported stereo, so â€â™‚ï¸. It's a "powered" mixer, so it has to be plugged into an outlet.  This mixer created a buzzing sound, so I had to also buy a cheap ground loop isolator (I think it was this model). I've read that these can theoretically affect audio quality, which bothers me, but at least I couldn't personally notice a difference.  There's also a slightly cheaper, unpowered mixer: the Rolls MX42 Stereo Mini Mixer . This is actually what I bought first, but I had to return it. It decreases the volume by a lot, which was too much for my setup. However, I didn't have any buzzing issues.  Both of these mixers use RCA, so I also needed a couple 3.55mm â†” RCA adapters. These are super cheap and I already had several on hand.    *Interestingly, the amount of buzzing seemed to depend on how heavily I was using my computer's GPU. For casual web browsing, there was almost no buzzing. Old or lightweight video games caused slight buzzing, and intensive games had tons of buzzing.

Quick answer, no.   Choosing the 2133MHz won't hurt your system, since the soldered one is "under-frequencied" by the CPU capabilities and having another 2400MHz stick to "choke" is not a really good idea.  You're right on choosing the CL15 one, 'cause is more important try matching the timing than the frequency.   Last thing, to be honest i would call 15-15-15-35 identical to 15-15-15-36 rather than just similar.  Hope this helps.
You should go with the Gigabyte Z370 HD3, since it is the cheapest option meeting your requirements. However, if your configuration requires a lot of RAM which you didn't mention, the most expensive option (ASUS configuration) offers 4 slots of RAM. According to the intel spec sheet for the i5-8600k, the maximum supported memory per slot is 32 gb. It's up to you whether you feel you will need more than 32gb of RAM in the future.  It's worth mentioning the GIGABYTE option has 2 m.2 SATA slots meaning you could potentially have two m.2 sata SSDs (The Samsung 970 Evo's are an affordable high performance option.)  Other recommendations  I took the liberty of checking your location on your Stack exchange profile which states you are from Montenegro, and a cursory google search tells me that you are not officially a part of the EU. This makes recommending you specific hardware not subject to additional shipping or tax import costs very difficult, however; here is an exhaustive list from pc part picker sorted by price that meets or exceeds your stated requirements. You can cross-check the prices you find there with your local purveyors. The site will also let you double check your builds for compatibility.
Due to your tight budget constriction, I was unable to find a laptop without a power-saving series cpu, however; I believe the processing power will be sufficient for your user case scenario. I also did not have to resort to rolling the metaphorical dice for a refurbished laptop to meet your price requirements so that is a plus as well.  I am recommending laptops that could ship directly to Italy (I used the postal code of Rome) today. Both laptops comes equipped with 8 gb of RAM which should be more than enough RAM for your usage case. Both come equipped with discrete graphics -the Nvidia MX150, which is one of the best budget gaming gpus that supersedes the Nvidia 940mx in this category. According to User Benchmark, the MX 150 has a 75% higher average user benchmark than the 940 mx.  Acer Aspire 5 (84ZP) â‚¬667,99 + â‚¬22.39 international shipping (MSRP: â‚¬769,99)    This laptop Features an i7-8550U, 256 GB SSD + 1TB HDD. This option is sold by Newegg, non-European purveyor, but it appears that no tax import or vat cost is being estimated by Newegg. In addition, it appears that it should ship to Italy within 3-5 days.  Acer Aspire 5 (53V6) â‚¬699,00 + free shipping (MSRP: â‚¬518.01)    This option, is both pricier and has worse specs than the newegg option, but all vendor logistics will take place in Italy. This is the option you should choose if you have any problems with VAT and tax importation that I was unable to account for in option 1.  It features an i5-8250 U and only 256 gb of SSD storage. Although it is a slightly older i5 model than the first options's CPU, according to User Benchmark, it's effective speed in only 4% slower.
If you're going to spending all your time in the command line, I don't imagine you're going to be needing all that much processing power, or even a dedicated graphics card. I looked up your TF101 tablet and it looks like you were happy with the performance you got out of a 1 gb of RAM and a tablet processor. To maximize battery life, I've recommended 2 4-cell Li-ion battery equipped laptops and a 6 cell li-ion battery. All laptops have 4 gb of RAM. Each laptop is an 11.6" laptop, about an inch and a half larger than your old tablet.  Acer Laptop TravelMate $161.99 + $2.99 shipping    This is the cheapest laptop that meets and exceeds the performance of you old system.   3.09 lbs. 32 gb Flash storage Celeron N3060 4 cell Li-ion battery   Acer Spin 1 $189.95    Get this if you want something that feels more like the tablet you used to have. This is one of the 360 laptops that can turn into a tablet but also has a keyboard. Slightly heavier than option 1.   3.31 lbs. 32 gb Flash storage Celeron N3350 4 cell Li-ion battery   HP Laptop EliteBook Revolve 810 G2 $377.01 + 3.99 shipping    This laptop is like option 2, but it's monitor can spin 360Â° on its axis in two directions. This option has a lot more storage and a significantly better CPU. Consider this option if you have the money.   3.08 lb 128 GB SSD i5-4300 U 6 cell Li-ion battery

SEE ON AMAZON   Acer Aspire V17 Nitro Price: $1,319.67     This Black Edition Aspire is a serious machine. Similar to the Asus ROG Strixx above, it sports roomy 17.3-inch Ultra-HD (3840 by 2160) display for all the true-cinematic format videos and special effects you conspire to throw at it. Thatâ€™s the kind of 4K display the Dell XPS 9560-7001SLZ PUS boastsâ€”although a touch-screen on the Dell.  Acer also shoved 512 GB of the faster SSD and additional 1TB of HDD storage into it. It will handle all that in tandem and fluidly as it ships with 16 GB of DDR4 Dual Channel RAM inbuilt (to run with the 6th-gen Intel Quad-core i7 CPUâ€”you can actually turbo boost it to 3.5 GHz).  One other honorable mention must be the DustDefender system. The heavy-handedness of professional-grade DAW suites make it too hot for many laptops to breathe, so it good to have a system built into a laptop to cool it down and blow the dust off the working innards. Thatâ€™s to like. If it makes any difference, you get Windows 10 (64-bit Home) out of the box. Expect a 7-hour battery life.  SEE ON AMAZON
I have EnerGenie EG-PM2 and was very fast to install and use on Linux/Ubuntu, steps here:  Install sispmctl  wget https://phoenixnap.dl.sourceforge.net/project/sispmctl/sispmctl/sispmctl-4.0/sispmctl-4.0.tar.gz tar xzvf sispmctl-4.0.tar.gz cd sispmctl-4.0/ sudo apt install libusb-dev ./configure make sudo make install sispmctl cp ./src/.libs/libsispmctl.so.0 /usr/local/lib sispmctl   The outlet has 4 ports, example to operate off and on port 1 you do the following commands  Turn off and on port 1  sudo sispmctl   -f 1 #Accessing Gembird #0 USB device 053 #Switched outlet 1 off sudo sispmctl   -o 1 #Accessing Gembird #0 USB device 053 #Switched outlet 1 on
What you need is a product from one of the enterprise-level (or enterprise-like...) manufacturers. All of them have this in one form or the other, and they are usually not expansive at all (though most of them lack wireless, it is not required by you.)   Ubiquiti EdgeRouter is probably the most known one of this genre. Then there's (as pointed out by @Jan Dorniak in the comments) MicroTik, and also UTT and other smaller brands.  But you need to be aware that all of these devices - given their enterprise-like status - while they are highly customizable and configurable, it is usually not as simple as the (dumb...) Asus or TP-Link and the likes, so there might be some learning curve to get to know them and be able to configure everything.    Ubiquiti has the perfectly capable EdgeRouter X for as low as $55. But if you are willing to pay up you can get the much more powerful (specs, but not necessarily needed) Edgerouter 8 Port Router for about $300. And in the middle there's the EdgeRouter POE if you can benefit of some PoE ports.  Here's a help article (and see links in the bottom) on how to configure the failover on Ubiquiti: https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/205145990  And, as mentioned, you can also look at UTT, for instance the UTT ER518 for just $54.
Most likely yes....   if the specs for the RAM are the same - size, speed & timings if the motherboard supports both sticks   If you have problems, you may be able to mitigate it by tweaking BIOS settings, but many motherboards will compensate for minor discrepancies (ie. lowering timings). You should be fine to trial it - you are not going to break anything. In fact, it will most likely work initially, but you will find the issue will be stability under load.  However, you are unlikely to be able to get support if you have any issues for OEMs - they will likely insist you do not mix & match, and will probably recommend Matched Pairs (sets of sticks that have been tested to work well together).
A KVM switch would be what you need. They are meant to control two or more computers from a single keyboard, mouse, and monitor. The keyboard and mouse are on one side of it. The monitor is on the other. That being said, you should be able to use a KVM switch without connecting anything to the monitor ports. This would allow each computer to operate with its own screen but same keyboard and mouse.  Just to be clear, with a KVM switch, you can only control one computer at a time. You will press a sequence of keys to switch computers. If you want to control them both at the same time with the same keystrokes, look into a USB splitter instead.
A software KVM might be useful:   Mouse Without Borders Input Director Share Mouse   You share one mouse & keyboard but not screens and in most cases you can move from machine to machine without even a keypress (the latter two options definitely support this).
It appears to be very difficult to find a Laser printer under $1000 that comes in as large a size as A3 (11.7 x 16.5 in). I was only able to find a Refurbished/Used - Like New system.  HP Color LaserJet Professional CP5225dn $500.00 + $54.59 shipping     Resolution: 600 DPI Rate: 20 Pages per minute (ppm) Technology: Laser (non-LED)   If your current printer already prints as 600 DPI or higher, you probably shouldn't upgrade unless you find that this printer's PPM is faster than your current printer and worth the upgrade. I would still suggest purchasing a brand new one ($1660) if you have the money.  *It appears the link is automatically redirecting to the full price page.
"RHEL certified" means that the hardware has been tested by Dell and will work as expected with RHEL.   If you want to have a laptop, then it's going to be easier in the long run to purchase this from a vendor. Dell provides (sorry for the US links and prices) an XPS 13 Developer Edition that you can upgrade to support most of your requirements. The highest end version can have the hard drive upgraded to 1 or 2TB. The others can only be upgraded to 512GB. The highest amount of RAM that any of them support is 16GB.   The total cost for the high end XPS with 16 GB of RAM and a 1TB drive is $2,350 plus whatever taxes and shipping comes out to be.  The downside of this is that you probably won't be able to add any components in the future since it's a laptop.  That said, I have a year old version of the XPS 13 Developer Edition running Ubuntu. I'm happy with it. It handles my development work without any issues. It came with Ubuntu 16.04 and upgraded to 18.04 without any problems a couple weeks ago.    If you really want to expand your components and resources in the future, you'll want to build something but I suspect it's not going to be a laptop.
It seems you were correct about laptops being more expensive in Sweden. As far as I could surmise it appears it will be cheaper to order a laptop from the USA and pay for international shipping. I seems that Sweden doesn't charge any import fees or VAT as far as I can tell. You also ask:     What would save a 'considerable' amount - buying from the provider with above features preconfigured or simply buy the hardware without OS(bare metal) and then install RHEL by myself?    There's a third option, buy hardware that already comes with an OS (most system do) and then install RHEL yourself. The procedure is identical even if it came without an OS.  MSI GL62M 11,944.84 kr + 306.50 kr international shipping    Comes right out of the box with 32 gb of RAM. Unfortunately, this laptop is not capable of an upgrade up to 64 gb of RAM, despite the i7-7700 HQ being capable supporting 64 GB of ram over 2 slots. Also if you're wondering about the powerful discrete graphics card, laptop manufacturers catering to this level of RAM capacity usually end up being gaming capable laptop purveyors where this is standard. This just so happened to be the cheapest laptop I could find. Perhaps if you use your Red Hat linux system for video rendering this may be more useful. MSI doesn't sell laptops directly.   i7-7700 HQ 32 GB 2400 DDR4 250 GB Samsung 960 EVO NVMe + 1 TB HDD NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2 GB   Lenovo ThinkPad P51 Workstation 20,580.26 kr + 395.77 kr international shipping    This option explicitly supports 64 GB of RAM. Most mobile systems don't really support 64 GB RAM upgrades because there isn't really a market for gratuitously expansive memory in laptops, as most people would purchase a non-mobile desktop/server system for the average user case scenario (hosting, servers, etc.). If you are thinking about 64 GB of RAM in the future, I would advise explicitly buying a 64 GB supported laptop out of the box as it is likely most laptops will only have 2 slots for memory meaning an upgrade will be a full replacement, as you won't be able to add to your existing memory infrastructure. Effectively, you will need to buy 2 32 GB memory sticks which will cost you in the ballpark of 1793.59 - 3587.18 kr. If you try and skimp on RAM costs, it is also likely you will buy poor latency (Higher CAS latency values) RAM, which will have inferior timings and therefore more delay. If you want to purchase a configurable system from the manufacturer here's a link.   i7-7700 HQ 64 GB 2400 DDR4 128 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD NVIDIA Quadro M1200M     Edit: Dell precision series response (link was too long to fit in a comment). This is the cheapest (purchasing directly from manufacturer) precision series laptop configuration that supports 64 GB of RAM. It will cost you 38,076.75 Kr, and isn't a very good deal.
Long time MacBookPro (on my 3rd) user and asp.net web developer here.  A Macbook Pro will blow your budget out of the water, and you will have storage issues. It is nice to have the portable option though.   Any new 21.5 iMac with a dedicated graphics card should cover all bases and fit your budget. Also consider running BootCamp instead of, or along side VMs.   BootCamp will give you native speeds and I've run VisualStudio very happily there, the downside is no direct sharing between OSX and Win. You do get extra overhead with VMs that may impact performance, though it's been a while since I've used one. I just BootCamp these days.   VMWare allows you to use the bootcamp partition as your VM, it was a little clunky swapping between VM and boot camp though due to Win Authentication issues (different hardware detected). This is when I gave up and exclusively used BootCamp. I'm not sure if other VM providers have the same feature or issues associated with it.  One more tip if using BootCamp look at Paragon - NTFS for Mac. It allows you to write to your BootCamp partition, or any other NTFS drive and is well worth the price.
I don't know if there are any devices that can be charged while in the pouring rain or wet at all for that matter. But if you just need GPS signal while biking then I suggest looking at the Xperia XZ compact line up. My wife and I have had Xperia phones and they do great even with full water submersion. Just turn on glove mode and they won't interact with water too much. And without a sim card inserted you should be able to use the GPS for ages before the battery dies you'll just have to use google maps offline maps feature or only set up routes when you are on wifi.
The only way to find out if the operating system you want will work on that hardware is to try it out. I'm guessing that the reason you're asking this question in the first place is because you want to save money on hardware and this server you found (used, maybe?) looks too good to be true. As with most things in life, it probably is.   The main issues that I can think of with this kind of hardware are power draw, noise, and graphics. Even if it seems like you're getting a great deal, you might end up spending more money in electrical bills over the course of the time you own the server than you would if you just bought a new, energy-efficient desktop. Additionally, the cooling for server-oriented machines is designed to get maximum airflow and dissipate the most heat, without any regards for noise level. If you use the machine near where you're working with it (as with most desktop deployments), you probably won't like how loud it will be. Finally, if you think about how most server-class machines are used, graphics is not too important. Most servers run headless (without a monitor) and so do no graphics whatsoever. If you can stand the other two annoyances, the lack of modern-ish graphics might be a deal-breaker if you intend to run a graphics-intensive operating system like Windows.
Generally, you need something like this. It is a UPS power regulator. Just make sure the PC is plugged into one of the UPS outlets and not just the surge protector outlets.   Also, send the phone and/or cable through it.  Cable in particular is a fat copper cable that can carry a large surge if struck by lightning.
While Dan Sp. suggestion will definitely work, I feel that spending $200 on a UPS is a bit overkill for your applications. Unlike my recommendation, however, it will keep your computer running for a few minutes if the power is interrupted which would allow time for your computer to sleep (most UPS systems come with software to do this for you automatically). I would still like to recommend a significantly cheaper alternative that can protect against Ethernet/co-axial/telephone as well.     In addition, UPS systems in general, may not protect you via Ethernet,   coaxial, or telephone lines, and not doing so may void your   equipment protection policy should you choose to exercise it in many cases.

Lightning is a hard problem.   I'd love to say there's a slick little product you can "Amazon and it's done", but not all problems can be solved that way (plus, other answerers are already doing that.)  That said, I promise there'll be some products mentioned.  On the high side of the transformer: Transformers are pretty good surge suppressors, so suppressing surges on the "high" side of the transformer helps  a lot.  Power distribution lines (the big 2400V lines that are the top row) have a couple defenses.  First, a "top wire" (OHGW) that is set above the 3 bare conductors - its job is to catch the lightning bolt instead of the conductors.  Second, a lightning arrestor device connecting each conductor to ground.  It has an engineered gap - wide enough to stop 2400V from arcing to ground, but still allow lightning to leap to ground. These can wear out/burn up from strikes, and leave too-wide a gap to be effective. You can't do anything about this stuff.  But you can walk your neighborhood distribution lines (on the high side of your transformer) and see if Duke has installed them, and shout a lot if they haven't.   Make sure your house's grounding/earthing is tip-top. I realize you're a renter and can't do this. But correct, modern grounding is an absolute requirement for some surge suppression systems to work, and certainly to qualify for any "power strip warranties".  Surge suppressors need ground as a place to dump the surges!  All electricity wants to return to source, and natural electricity's (lightning) source is the earth. If you can't make your house's grounding tip-top, don't bother with surge suppressing power strips or whole-house suppressors.  They won't work.     Make sure comms entrances are also grounded. Code requires that your cable TV, phone/DSL etc. lines go through a lightning arrestor on the outside of the house.  These arrestors need to be very well grounded, ideally just a few feet away from a ground rod (better: two) going into the earth.  A renter might be able to pester the ISP to fit quality surge suppressors on cable/phone. However, if the ground wire is thin, and has to be carried some long distance to get to the ground rod, it's almost a waste of time.   Defend against neutral problems. Problems with neutral can cause voltages that should be 120V to fluctuate wildly between 0 and 240V.  However this is easily handled by auto-ranging switching power supplies - the kind rated to function on a range of voltage such as 100-264V or 90-306V. They autorange on the fly, and when they get a spike that's below 264V, they just treat it like more usable power.  Many products are already this; just make sure yours are.     A whole-house surge suppressor. Again a renter can't install this. Siemens, Eaton etc. are big players in industrial power distribution. They make whole-house surge suppressors.  These are hardwired right into the service panel. In some cases they tap the mains, otherwise you hang them off a 60A breaker.   If you were hardcore, I suppose you could buy a large metal electrical box, put a cord and strain relief on it, and a whole-house surge suppressor and some sockets.  VoilÃ , the world's biggest baddest surge suppressing power strip.     Air-gap your connectivity.  Lightning can't leap across WiFi.  If there's any way to WiFi your connectivity, do it.  If you feel you can't, then make sure your demarcation point surge suppression is tip-top, and maybe add some in-house surge suppression too. (but this is pointless if your grounds are rubbish.)   Buy quality power supplies. Since it sounds like you build your gaming rig, don't treat the power supply like an afterthought or buy one for the flashy lights. Buy the best. Server tier power supplies are not excessive at all.  A good power supply can take a lot of hits, because that's its job. VESA isn't famous for taking surges. Buy ones that are.     An isolation transformer.  Here's something a tenant can do! However these things are massive with an iron core and copper windings.  Transformers (like the one on your neighborhood's utility pole) are huge inductors tuned to one frequency: 50 or 60 Hz depending which continent you are on.  Like any large inductor, they only like to pass 50/60Hz, so they tend to block spikes and surges. If you have any other lightning arresting in place, that should keep spike voltage low enough that it won't leap the transformer's insulation.  Place your equipment on the isolated side of the transformer, and it should see almost no external noise.    I am reluctant to say "ground the isolated side of the power supply" if your house's grounds aren't very good.  It may be better to leave it an isolated system, except then you'll end up with an islanded ground. I'd fix that with GFCI. Every piece of interconnected equipment needs to be on the isolation, except for modems and routers - otherwise the connecting cords will simply carry the spike around the isolation transformer.   Acquiring an isolation transformer can be tricky.  First, it's not a step-up/down transformer.  You can just up-n-buy one from Amazon, but the price may hurt.  I see "5 KVA" service transformers all the time on Craigslist for $100 or so, and those'll work just fine as an isolation transformer with an excess of capacity -- but you'll need a 240V power source and some help from an electrician to set it up.  In that case I would probably get a small rack and set it up like a PDU.  Craigslist sometimes sees 1.5 KVA transformers that are much lighter weight.   You need an isolation transformer of appropriate size (look on your equipment's nameplate for its rating in VA [similar to watts but not quite the same], otherwise multiply amps by your line voltage: 120 or 230V).  Expect cheap gaming rigs to have numbers in the 1200 VA range (yes I know the power supply says "850W"!) If you can measure actual peak draw with a Kill-a-Watt, you can go with that number instead.
For your microprocessor you should worry only about voltage and temperature; in that order. Everything else is mostly irrelevant.
Shortly: NO.  Long: it gets really complicated, for sure there are bandwidth limitations and a hub will always be limited.  If you also introduce external display support, you should be aware that this cuts the maximum possible bandwith a LOT.  You will probably never be able to use a 5K external display and have a 10GBe ethernet connection from a single USB-3.0 hub.  Powering over USB-C limits also the maximum speed, so in that aspect USB-C is kinda doomed because it only introduced a standard port but when it comes to capabilities, there are lots and lots of footnotes to read.... as in "you get A feature only when B AND C XOR D happens.
I was originally thinking of recommending you a wall plugged USB hub, however; it seems you already went that route and the hubs were unable to negotiate the power necessary for reliability. Because of this, I had to take a step back and think of an approach that would be guaranteed to run two HDD's at the same time. I ultimately decided to recommend you specialized hardware designed for your exact user case scenario.  Startech 2.5 SSD/HDD Enclosure $66.15 (MSRP: $92.99)    In practice, this system acts as a hardware layer between your HDD's and you target machine with a mini-PSU strapped to the back. This system will most definitely be able to handle your user case scenarios. Here's a video of the enclosure in action. It will of course, need to plug into the wall with an AC to DC adapter.   2 Bay enclosure Internal SATA interface (I/II/III) USB 3.0 2 A Output Current 5 v Output Voltage Compatible with Windows, Mac, Chrome and Linux (2.4.x and up) Individual switches (inside enclosure) Supports RAID 0/1/JBOD and BIG   There is also a USB 3.1 variant for $86.99 (MSRP: 125.99) and a Thunderbolt 2 variant for $236.37 ($326.99). Personally, I would stick with the USB 3.0 variant I recommended above as SATA III only supports up to 6 Gb/s anyway. The other 2 variants are overkill unless you want fan speed control and/or configure the system for a RAID 0 (striping) SSD configuration and purchase SSDs actually capable of 750 MB/s+ combined simultaneous read and write speeds. I say SSDs because any HDD you buy is pretty much never going to actually hit the SATA III limit anyway.
Wavlink 7-Port USB 3.0 Superspeed Hub with 48W Power Adapter â‚¬25,99    I've had a pretty good experience with Wavlink products in the past. They seem to be good at delivering a premium look and feel without the premium price. It claims to be capable of      Transfer data at speeds of up to 5 Gbps through 7 ports   and      Compatible with the BC 1.2 charging standard, the 7-Port USB 3.0 Hub   can charge your devices up to 2.4A each port when being used as a   stand-alone charger with no host computer attached    USB standard Support: 1,2,3.0 Offline charging up to 5V/2.4A per port Power switches and LEDs for each port 12V/4A Power Adapter   Oh and by the way, international shipping is free, so that's a nice plus.
Based on the spec sheet and model number that you provided, and this review it looks to me like any optional M.2 PCIe NVMe 2280 SSD should work. Crucial lists several if you expand the list. It never hurts to double check with the manufacturer regarding any limitations inherent in your particular model.   I would be remiss if I didn't note an SSD should never be as slow as a hard drive and that this is truly the result that you are getting, something is most definitely wrong (possibly your testing methodology) as the Toshiba MQ01ABD100 is a 5400 RPM drive and the benchmarks are less than stellar and the Adata you linked to on it's worst day should benchmark much faster.
Late answer, but if you are looking for a cheap tablet, you could try a Yuntab K107 for $81.    Specs:   10.1 inch, 1280x800 IPS screen 1.3Ghz quad core processor 1GB RAM (1033Mhz?), 16GB ROM (on most models, only 1.5GB is in the internal memory block and the rest is an internal SD card) Wi-Fi (802.11abgn), Bluetooth 4.0, 2G/3G Slots for microSD (up to 32GB) and 2 SIM cards   Pros (for your purpose):   10.1" screen No CM/LineageOS, but does have Android 5.1 Good audio quality Good screen (not an AMOLED though, so no good blacks) Supports 1080p30 video Several optional accessories, such as a non-keyboard case, a keyboard case, and a silicone case.   Cons:   Cheap Some users have reported defects (like lines on the screen)   If something cheap isn't for you, you could alternatively get a Samsung Galaxy Tab A for about $280.    Specs:   10.1 inch, 1920x1200 screem 1.6Ghz octa-core processor 2GB RAM @1866Mhz, 16GB ROM 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2   Pros (for your purpose):   Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) 10.1" AMOLED screen Supports 1080p60 (not 4k) Lots of accessories   (I personally haven't used the second device listed, but it is a lot better then the first one if you are not on an extreme budget)
You should look for Wi-Fi repeaters or extenders. You don't need a network cable for this. Xiaomi has them but there are other companies too   Here's from another company (Netgear)
After looking deeper into this, the second free M2 slot is SATA. The best choice is SATA M2 with B&M key like the Crucial MX500
This question was bumped by the Community user a couple of hours ago. Presumably user "gem" has either purchased a computer or is willing to wait. I'll try to provide a leading edge suggestion that doesn't bust the upper limits of his generous budget. My suggestion only accounts for the cost of a bootable computer and doesn't include the statistical analysis software or the cost of installation and configuration.  I will offer a few suggestions, obviously there are thousands of choices:  Windows or Linux, the hardware is the same - only the software would change.  Statistical Software:   Windows: JMP statistical analysis software - U$1,785 Linux: It is possible to run JMP in a virtual container for Linux users. There are many websites suggesting statistical analysis software for Linux, some of the suggestions are: R, PSPP, SOFA Statistics, and others. It's also possible to run the Linux software in a virtual container for Windows users, often there is a Windows version of popukar Linux software available too.   Hardware:   Quadro RTX 5000 with 16GB memory - U$2,300 Computer: Supermicro A+ SuperServer 4023S-TRT - U$12,377   2x AMD EPYC 7351 Processor 16-core 2.40GHz 64MB Cache (155/170W) 256 GB via 8 DIMMs at 2666 MHz 1.0TB Samsung 960 PRO M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe Solid State Drive 10.0TB SATA 6.0GB/s 7200RPM - 3.5" - Seagate Exos X10 Series (Helium) 2x IntelÂ® 10-Gigabit Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X710-T4 (4x RJ45) Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Standard (24-core) 2x Additional 4-core License for Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Standard 5-Device Client Access License (CAL) for Microsoft Windows Server 2016/2012 Additional 16-core License for Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Standard 3 Year Depot Warranty (Return for Repair)    Unfortunately that site doesn't have a 'Share this configuration' link but it lets you print out a Spec sheet. If you removed all the Microsoft Windows software and licenses the cost would be U$10,725 without: "Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Standard (24-core)" and "5-Device Client Access License (CAL) for Microsoft Windows Server 2016/2012" and "Additional 2x4-core License for Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Standard".  The Quadro RTX 5000 (16GB with 256-bit memory bus) for U$2,300 isn't available yet and getting a better model involves a steep jump in price with an RTX 6000 (24GB memory and 384 bit bus) for U$6,300 ESP or an RTX 8000 (48GB, also with 384-bit memory bus) for most of your budget at U$10,000 - The JMP Statistical Analysis Software will support those cards and their associated speedup of calculations.  A second 1TB SSD would allow you to RAID the drives for another U$654 but that's punching the roof on the budget. Alternatively two 512GB drives could be had for an extra U$90 over a single 1TB drive. It's almost double the speed versus twice as much on deck.  The hardware is only a suggestion since you'll have to wait until year's end for the GPU, so you might as well wait for the Epyc 8000 series with 7nm technology and likely at least 50% more cores and likely a higher clock rate.  It sort of an in-between time for buying a system for the future. Buying last year's hardware at a considerable savings is another possibility but you lose both the warranty and the big advantages that are promised by year end.
One manufacturer that offers Dolby Atmos headphones with above/below 360Â° sound is Plantronics with their RIG 800LX, 600LX and 400LX. Truth be told, Atmos works with any stereo headphones but it's bound to be a bit better with headphones that are licensed by Dolby.  Another option is 7.1 headphones, with not just two stereo drivers but several.   Razer Tiamat 7.1 V2 delivers surround sound through 10 discrete drivers â€“ 5 in each ear cup. A similar idea is used by the Asus ROG Centurion 7.1 gaming headsets, with five discrete neodymium magnets in each ear cup.
One option is to buy a USB 3.0 docking station. Switching all your peripherals would then only require unplugging a USB cable and plugging it to the other machine.  It is very convenient, although don't expect it to support 4K resolution, and since the frames are compressed for speed it adds a bit of load to the CPU and does not make use of your machine's GPU.
I found this: USB 3.0 ExpressCard 34MM for GNU / Linux (TPE-USB3EXCD).  It's said to be compatible with Windows XP / Vista / 2000 / 7 / 8 and most recent linux distributions.  I haven't buyed and tested it yet, however.  Iâ€˜m thankful for more recommendations, however !
I want to mention that there are also models with 8GB of RAM and more options to choose from in the price range between $350 to $1500.     I am in the market for a Chromebook. This will be a second machine, like a Kindle Fire with a keyboard. I'm not imagining any kind of power use at all, just streaming, reading, word processing, surfing, and monitoring of videos and photos as I shoot them. But that's not to say that I couldn't discover that I like using it for other things too.   Kindle Fire with keyboard, that pretty much is how I use my Asus C302 and I also think of it as: Â»nah, it's not running anything fancy.Â« But actually it can amount to quite a lot and there is not much left of 4GB RAM even though I usually use it with GalliumOS and Firefox which is a bit more aggressive with memory management (you should stick with Chrome OS though!).  Edit: on second thought, I cannot imagine making good use of more than 8GB with your usage patterns at the moment. I had a laptop with 16GB for two years, not used for gaming or hosting more than one virtual machine, RAM was just rather cheap at that time.    From the point of view that a Chromebook is a piece of computer hardware with a keyboard and a 10-15 inch screen that runs a webbrowser to display websites it may look like 4GB are sufficient. At the moment.  The best way to find out if 4GB is enough for you would be open Chrome's Taskmanager during your usual desktop browsing and check how much Chrome consumes. Some extensions also consume additional RAM, websites tend to grow and be designed more responsive, also people usually have several tabs open or pinned. 4GB is okay for now but on top of my head knowing the browsing habits of people around me and my own and that a Chromebook may well last 5 years or more while being regularly updated with security updates and new features(!), I'd recommend to spend a bit more money to get an 8GB model at least.  From another point of view I have watched 2GB Chromebooks and HDMi sticks suffer under the load of poorly written iframe Grafana & Kibana madness for months. You don't want to run out of RAM if it can be avoided.  Chromebooks also feature Android Apps and Linux apps (Crostini). It is still not a full fledged desktop experience like a Mac or Windows computer but you certainly have the possibility to make use of more than 4GB RAM now or in the future. Some people may argue that you could close some rather unimportant tabs or that the browser should manage background tabs better but I don't think that is a good solution as you may want to use a split view to view more pages at the same time, work with multiple monitors (small portable monitors exist) or just have the information ready when you need it (and no network access).  The benefit is to not run out of RAM, which results in significant system slow downs. Also typically RAM cannot be upgraded on Chromebooks. I'd give the same advice for Chromebooks as I'd give for any laptop that you are going to use the next couple of years: 4GB RAM is not enough, get 8GB and have peace of mind.    Edit 2018-09-12: There is another point to consider: the processor.  To keep it simple: try to avoid Intel processors where the model number starts with an N.  These are out-of-order low power CPU designs and different from typical mobile CPUs. They have been marketed as Atoms but also as Celerons and Pentiums. If you can afford to spend more money get a device with at least a Pentium processor without an N in the model number, or even better an m3/i3 or m5/i5. Intel has been very liberal with names and letters which is very confusing for consumers after some generations/years.  Google is likely going to present a successor to the Pixelbook in a few weeks. Keep your eyes open you may find a good deal for the old model. If that's not an option you can check reddit where a user posts a Bi-Weekly Buying Advice Thread, here is the latest one at the time of writing: https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/9ci9bd/biweekly_buying_advice_thread_sep_2_15/   I live in Germany where Chromebooks are rather unpopular, so there isn't much advice I can give where to get the best deal in your region.  Final note: I also do have a Lenovo N22 with said Celeron N processor, It gets work done (it's the one I tortured with iframes) it's just not that kind of device you were initially looking for, a convertible for a bit more than $500 and 8GB should be a good choice for the next 5 years.
The printer Sharp MX-5140N has all your mentioned specifications.   BUT: it is an printer for big offices, if you look for a printer at home, this is not for you.   Additionally it might be best, if you rent this printer with a SLA.

One option you have would be to use a straight circuit board with appropriate traces, if the minimalistic approach is your objective. I have what is described on Gearbest as a USB flashlight:    It is a 1.92 mm thick piece of circuit board that fits well into the USB port of my powerbank. The price for five is US$1.13 from gearbest. This is one example.   Additional searching has discovered a link to a site called eLabBay which sells prototype boards that are a bit more bulky than the USB flashlight:    You would be able to ignore the header pins and cut away the wings to further reduce the profile, if needed. At bit more expensive at US$6.48, but it's also just another example.  There are circuit board services which will produce boards from your design. In larger quantities, I'd expect the prices would be better than this last one, but requires that you create a design. I did a quick search for "pcb service" and the first return showed ten pieces for five dollars and that was only one entry. There may be others at lower prices.  Of course, all of this does require that you perform the soldering, but it's not as finicky as doing so with typically stock small gauge USB wire.
You can't, at least not on macOS.  There's no high quality duplex audio Bluetooth profile, maximum what you can get is 16 kHz duplex SBC (mSBC, "Wideband speech"). It's better than SCO (8 kHz), but not dramatically.  For some reason, Bluetooth SIG hasn't been interested in implementing high quality duplex audio since 2003. The only solution is available from Cambridge Silicon Radio (now Qualcomm), the FastStream pseudo codec, which in fact is SBC with backchannel A2DP hack. It provides fullband audio and wideband speech, but the headphones with FastStream support are very rare, and it would probably work only on Windows with CSRHarmony Bluetooth driver.
The closest equivalent is a USB adapter with multiple card readers. Here are a few:   StarTech.com USB 3.0 External Flash Multi Media Memory Card Reader - SDHC MicroSD Vogek USB 3.0 Card Reader Hub DictoPro USB Hub Adapter Dual Mode USB-C MicroSD Reader

I would start with software - Wireshark works on both Windows and Linux and lets you see all the packets reaching your computer. It's free.  Also read about magic packets - wake on LAN has nothing to do with TCP. In fact it does not even use IP!  Going further - some better routers, such as the MikroTik Hex allow you to sniff all the traffic going through them.  As for a TV or an IP camera which has open documentation for it's custom TCP protocols - I wouldn't count on the availability of such a device.
According to the manual for this mainboard, located at the manufacturer's web site: MSI Support, this specific board has the correct connector for the cable you've linked in your post.  Page 11 has the layout of the connectors and other features of the board:    Page 22 has a closer detail of the connector, along with the confirmation that this is a serial port. Be sure to note the keyed pin, which appears to be missing on the cable you've linked.    Typically the number 1 pin corresponds to the dark stripe on the ribbon cable. Some cables will have the socket filled to prevent or reduce the possibility of incorrect connections.  Your top photo shows most of the legend for JCOM1 and the pins to be used. If you experience communications difficulties, ensure in the BIOS that the port is not intentionally disabled.
That MYLB DB9 RS232 to 10 pin Ribbon Cable Connector Adapter goes into that JCOM1 pin header in your top picture. You have to make sure that pin 1(of JCOM1) and the red line(of ribbon cable) are on the same side. You may (or may not) need to also enter BIOS to enable COM1 (or Serial) settings, though usually(with any motherboard really) their defaults are already set and COM1 is enabled.
Since you didn't specify an exact budget and were willing to accept a few substitutions, along with the huge variety of choices and preferences it seems best to suggest websites that have what you want; and can click checkboxes for features and sort of a few preferences. These are all in the UK:   Laptops Direct SaveOnLaptops Currys PCWorld   There's a few hundred choices for under Â£1K.
Have you considered an All-In-One where everything is contained behind the screen (as opposed to the way some of them have some of the guts in the foot)?  There's very few i7 examples for a lot less than Â£1K but here's a couple:  Aspire Z 24 All-In-One Desktop - Z24-880-UR12 Â£437.57   I couldn't find it in the UK Acer store yet, as it's very new.    While it's only an i5 the MSI Pro 24X 7M-005EU has a big bottom, that means it's user upgradable. The manufacturer's website explains the features more in-depth than PriceSpy. An i7 version is likely going to be available too. This demonstrates that an AIO can be upgraded:
As you have shown an Arduino type device in your photo, you may want to consider to explore the world of Arduino controlled PID devices. I have a stand-alone device which consists of a thermocouple wired to the PID and a solid state relay which is used to turn a heater on and off based on the temperature settings within the PID  The manual method requires that one make settings to match the thermocouple and to set the upper or lower limit of heating or cooling respectively.  I have not explored the Arduino connected versions, but a quick search shows there are quite a few projects making use of this configuration.
MSI GX63VR â‚¬1.375,99 + â‚¬23,62 International Shipping (MSRP: â‚¬1.460,99)    This is a VR capable laptop that can ship to Lisbon, Portugal in under 5 business days (I took the liberty of checking the location on your stack-exchange profile). I decided to recommend you a laptop equipped with a GTX 1070 as benchmarks suggest this laptop will outperform the ASUS Vivobook Pro 15 N580's GTX 1050 by 186%. 1080 setups, unfortunately were over budget despite outperforming 1070 setups by 22%. In addition, this laptop comes equipped with an PCI-e M.2 SATA SSD.   Nvidia GTX 1070 8 GB i7-7700 HQ 16 GB Memory 256 GB M.2 SATA SSD 1 TB HDD 15.6" 1080p   If you don't like buying laptops internationally, here are some local stores in Lisbon that carry MSI laptops. You seem to know what you're doing, so I don't think that you would have any trouble finding a couple MSI laptops to add to your options.
Magnetic strips are the least of your worries as they are easily found with a web search on rubber+magnetic+strip.  SMD 5050 LED strips are also pretty easy to get and the impedance at 5VDC is common. However, you will need the 3-pin addressable header connector Asus uses, so I would find a real live electronics store, take a picture of the header from the last link, and see what you can find.

I've tried to keep your budget as close to $500 as possible making every micro optimization that I know of.  Custom Build Part List $555.68    Intel i5-8400 Liquid CPU Cooler Cooler Master - MasterLiquid Lite 120 8GB DDR4-2666 G.Skill - Ripjaws V Series M.2 SSD 128GB Samsung - PM961 Nvidia GTX 1050 2GB (MSI) Micro ATX Gigabyte - H310M 450W PSU EVGA 80+ Bronze Certified ATX Power Supply MicroATX Mini Tower Case Rosewill - FBM-01   Optional HDD Suggestion:   300GB 10000 RPM HDD Western Digital VelociRaptor   Analysis/Justifications  GPU Choice  Foremost, typically the most expensive part of a high-end custom build tends to be its GPU, where the latest 1080 and 1070 GPUs cost about your entire budget alone. In order to reduce cost I decided to recommend you a GTX 1050 which should be able to render 4K at 60 fps, I don't believe the C++ OpenCV libraries are terribly inefficient so you should be good there.  CPU Choice  The i5-8400 is on par with the i7-6700K in terms of performance with the exception of floating point calculations where it lags behind a little bit.  SSD Choice  The PM 961 outperforms the 2.5" Samsung 860 EVO with a whopping 1496 MB/s seq read and 722 MB/s seq write. If you're not familiar with them, the Samsung EVO's are well known for being one the best valued SSDs and can pack quite a punch. I have an 840 EVO and can attest to its performance.  RAM Choice  I had to skimp on the RAM to try and save money. I did however try to find RAM with the lowest CAS latency.  Build Caveats  In order to save money on the Motherboard, I had to use a motherboard that only supports up to 32 GB of RAM despite the i5-8400 supporting up to 64 GB of RAM split over 2 slots. Also the cheap-o case I recommended doesn't have front panel USB 3.0 ports.    In case you missed it, here is the PC Part Picker page for this build which will help you automatically track the best place to buy each part for your build.
When it comes to comparing CPUs in an objective way without having them on hand, the quickest way to estimate how a processor will perform, and therefore, its value you is to look at benchmarks between the processors. Here, we can see the effective speed is pretty negligible, but the average user benchmark for multi core scenarios is markedly faster.     I mean it is not a real core right?   Well, it depends on what you define as a "real core". Take a look at Intel's article on its Hyper Threading technology for a sense of the mechanics behind the theoretical cores.  In terms of "is it a real core" in a "does it do anything?" sense, the 4 theoretical cores does make a measurable impact as the i7 has a faster Multi Core Integer and Floating Point calculation speed by about 33% and a bench marked multi core speed of +39%.     Are the extra 4 threads really worth paying double the price?   The four extra cores on the i7 are "theoretical" or hyper thread cores.   Whether it is worth it, really depends on your user case scenario. Something like video encoding may benefit more from the increased multi-thread speed, while a badly written single threaded game might not see as much benefit.  My guess is if this computer is going to be for general use, you could probably get away with the i5. Computer enthusiasts making gaming builds typically downgrade to i5 variants of their i7 processor when their budget demands it, as it is usually better to reallocate those resources for a higher end GPU.
I have made my decision, after some time. I got the laptop with the GL702VS
You can opt for the "Dell U2717D" transition because you'll be upgraded in two years.Two years later, display technology is certainly not comparable to today's.
"Seems to lag a bit" is quite a wide definition. An SSD will speed up start-up of applications and responsiveness of the system when the HDD is under load. You can tell pretty easily if the HDD is slowing the computer down by listening to the seek noise. 2 GB RAM is also not much these days, so it also could happen that you'll hear the hard drive being busy because it's swapping to disk. Linux Mint MATE should be less memory hungry.  If the computer stutters when playing video, that would be a different problem, it would mean that the CPU is too slow to decode it and the GPU is not helping because it's either too old/weak (doesn't support decoding modern video formats) or it potentially could but Linux drivers don't support it.  You can see CPU and memory usage in a program called htop (can be installed from the repositories), that can also tell you where the problem could be. In any case, don't expect any miracles. I've been running a very highly clocked Core 2 Duo with 8 GB RAM and an SSD on a motherboard from 2007 and sometimes could not figure out why it was so slow compared to a nimble laptop with 2014 tech. It's just... old :)

Have you considered using a small dedicated 12V supply to power the pump and lights? I'm not sure what the behavior of your pump is when there's no PWM signal on the fan header while the computer is powered off. It may go full power turbo on you or go off entirely. That would be for you to experiment with. I see, that the pump goes to 24 watt, depending on your LED setup you might get away with using something like a 50W 12Vdc regulated supply. Those are not too hard to find. The important thing is then to connect ground but create a separate 12V rail just for the pump and lights and not let that reverse feed your main PSU. Things might get smokey otherwise. Just take an extra connector, cut the 12V wire and feed it from the new supply; connect ground(0V) to your PSU ground(0V) so the PWM and fan speed signals won't get confused. Probably also important to use an ungrounded plug for the small supply since I bet the main PSU is already grounded(earth ground). Otherwise if you connect two earth grounded supplies, there is a decent possibility of sparks. Of course be very careful when modifying several hundred watt power supply wiring and test everything on the bench before plugging in your devices and components.
Use the NVR.  Itâ€™s a dedicated piece of equipment that will consume less energy than a windows 10 computer.  NVRâ€™s also contain different hard drives that are specifically made for constant writing and over-writing of video (they last longer).  In my house the NVR is tucked away (and cleverly disguised) on a closet shelf.  This adds to security as an intruder likely wouldnâ€™t be able to find it.  (They steal it and you lost your video of the event.)  (Remember if you choose to hide yours that it does need proper ventilation and should not be in an unconditioned space like an attic.)  We did need to attach a keyboard, monitor, and mouse to the NVR briefly during initial setup.  We set the password and configured the network settings.  Once that is done we shut the system down and removed the keyboard, monitor, and mouse.  Then powered it back up without.   This configuration is called â€œheadlessâ€, and the unit has been in use for years without monitor, keyboard or mouse.   Any of our windows computers can be used anytime to view and download video, and the computers donâ€™t need to be turned on all the time.
Consider Intel's (former Altera) FPGAs - they have an OpenCL compiler. They even have PCIe development kits. Or the Xeon Phi series which might be better suited for this.
There are many offerings that should suffice. I have a Netgear Wifi extender which has a Gigabit network port, which directly addressesyour question:  http://www.netgear.co.uk/home/products/networking/wifi-range-extenders/EX6120.aspx  But you may also want to consider a Wifi Homeplug - Again, I also have a Netgear offering; you get a powerline adapter/homeplug at one end, and another plug that also has a built-in Wifi access point for the other end.  https://www.netgear.com/home/products/networking/powerline/XWNB5201.aspx  In this case, the Wifi is only N-standard rather than AC, but the benefit is that you don't need to run cable through the house.
Elecrow AUS50024E (1920x1080 or 2560x1600 HDR, 10.1") they have a big selection, visit their website. They make no mention of this working with Dex but do say:     Works perfectly for PS3, PS4, WiiU, XBOX360, Raspberry Pi 3, 2, & 1 Model B or B+, industrial equipment, car audio and video, car headrest, medical equipment display.  The GeChic 1503E Monitor (1920x1080, 15.6") specifically mentions that usability with smartphones is one of its abilities:     Enlarge Your Mobile Phone without Sacrificing Quality   On-Lap 1503E is always your smartphoneâ€™s perfect match. Make sure your smartphone supports HDMI output and use the manufacturerâ€™s adapter to output your mobile phone to On-Lap 1503E.  The GeChic 1101P Monitor (1920x1080, 11.6") has HDMI, and DisplayPort, it mentions it works with a Mac, no mention of smartphones, uses a battery pack (which is probably better than USB powered). The GeChic 1102H Monitor (1920x1080, 11.6") has built-in battery that they claim lasts 4 1/2 hours.   See also: "10 Best Portable Monitors".  It is also possible to use Moverio BT-300 glasses which simulate a 40" (at 2.5 m) or 320" (at 20 m) screen, they're U$800 but don't need a Dex; they can also be used to fly a drone (if that recoupes some of the cost).
The quick answer:  No, there are no consumer grade ML ASICs you can purchase, and there won't be until the one mentioned in your post launches.  The rabbit hole:  If you absolutely need local hardware:  Most GPUs still have an amazing value proposition for ML, even if they don't have tensor cores. Generally speaking, Nvidia GPUs are more supported in the ML world, so unless you physically can't, go with Nvidia for this task. Right now, the RTX 2080/2080ti, even with ray-tracing not utilized, is the best value proposition for money down, in your machine hardware, thanks to their tensor cores. The next step up would be the 5000$ GV Titan card, which is in a price category you want to avoid. If you really don't want to waste any potential, grab a high-end 10 series card, but be aware that these do not have any ML hardware optimizations.  The ASIC-like option:  Your question made me remember that Google mentioned some time ago that they too were developing ML orientated ASICs called TPUs short for "tensor processing units". I did some digging and it seems that this project has morphed from commercially available ASICs into a ML research driven cloud service. I will link it here: https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/pricing   If you are willing to use a cloud service, your value proposition changes depending on how often you have to train your ML algorithms. If you are going to train your algo 24/7 with minor tweaks, go with a local GPU. Otherwise the Google service seems like a reasonable alternative to a hardware investment.
I used "six axis joystick with rotation" as the search terms and came up with an open-source resource from the UNMND web site. It appeals to me because I like to build stuff and this one is very much a home-build type of project.    I have a 3dconnexion SpacePilot Pro which has the requirements you describe, but it is fairly expensive and may not necessarily link to an arduino or pi board.  My search found very little else suitable for your objective.
You can do this with a managed switch. My personal experience is only with small/medium business managed switches, but either the ProSafe M5300-28GF3: 24-port Gigabit SFP Managed L3 Switch (GSM7328FS v2) (~$1500) or the NETGEAR ProSAFE 48-Port Gigabit Managed Switch Layer 2+ With Static L3 Routing (GSM7248) (~$450) can do this.  Documentation on how to handle this from the CLI and the web UI is available on the Netgear knowledge base.  Example from the CLI  (Netgear Switch) #config (Netgear Switch) (Config)#interface 1/0/2 (Netgear Switch) (Interface 1/0/2)#routing (Netgear Switch) (Interface 1/0/2)#ip address 192.150.2.1 255.255.255.0 (Netgear Switch) (Interface 1/0/2)#exit (Netgear Switch) (Config)#exit   This will set the IP address of interface 1/0/2 to be 192.150.2.1. This does not require that you know the MAC address of the device ahead of time.
The closest to what you are asking is NVIDIA Tesla - it's dedicated, does not have even single DP / HDMI output, it's power efficient and is optimized for 'AI'. See NVIDIA Tesla T4, NVIDIA Tesla V100, NVIDIA Tesla P100, NVIDIA Tesla P4/P40. Whether it's most cost efficient depends on many factors. If you're buying for a larger institution, take a look at data center solution based on Tesla V100.  The second candidate would be NVIDIA Jetson. It looks to be designed for ML / AI in robotics, as an end-to-end solution (as opposed to agent communicating with server). It's a dev kit, including ARM CPU, GPU, RAM, eMMC storage and 2 DeepLearning accelerators, at a price tag of 2.5k $ (but it's small!).  I could not find any benchmarks, but they state, that it's 20 times faster and draws 1/10 of electricity than it's predecessor, NVIDIA JETSON TX 2, which was benchmarked ex. here.   Having said that, it really depends on your use cases - if you will profit from it's modularity, dont' have any other hardware bought for the setup and will use it as embeded (like you'd use RaspberryPi), that NVIDIA's Jetson is perfect. If you want to make a server for AI, I would consider RTX 2080/2080ti as user9313 suggests and NVIDIA Tesla line, and peak whichever is most cost efficient for you - which is impossible to say without knowing the framework / library you'll use. Also, as mentioned by user9313, the cloud is already a viable option, not only Google 1,2 but also Microsoft has good APIs and even cloud IDE.  Also, adding to the wish-list other projects to keep an eye on:   Brain-Inspired Microchip by stanford IBMs 'True North' Graphcore
I would aim to build the rig that would be easy to extend in the future by adding more RAM, SSD storage, graphics card, changing CPU for stronger and what not. Therefore, the Mo-Bo (Motherboard) is the most important component. It will either provide additional connectivity, multiple PCI-e lanes and modern CPU family, or you will have to throw it away when upgrading anything. The CPU family is a thread in itself: would you like to go red or blue (AMD/Intel)? Which generation? This dictates the Mo-Bo choice. But I will try recomending couple of things.  Just looking at logicalincrements and swaping the GPU for better storage:   AMD Ryzen 5 1500X - it has a nice 150-ish $ price tag, 4 threads, very good overall performance, comes with stock cooler and the platform on Mo-Bo for Ryzen will let you upgrade in the future to ex. used Ryzen 7.  MSI B450-A Pro - very decent Mo-Bo. Or even cheaper MSI B350 PC MATE. Also good. Keep an eye for: M2 slot or slots, with NVMe support (superior speeds), USB 3.1 support and type-C, number of USB ports, chipset, RAM slots no. (prefer 4) and audio quality.  8 GB of DDR4 ram - single stick. Unless you really really need 16 Gigs of RAM ASAP, I'd try living for some time with just 8 and buying more later, when it's cheaper, and having better SSD. RAM is probably the easiest component to add to a PC.  Do not go with 2 * 4 GB - you have 2 or 4 slots for RAM (hopefully 4), so upgrading would be possible only to 16 GB vs 32GB. (~80$) SSD - Samsung 500GB 970 EVO M.2  or ADATA 480GB M.2 PCIe XPG (cheaper) - these are not your usual SSDs - they are couple of times faster, as disk I/O is the no.1 bottleneck for developpers. Go with good one drive at the beginning for OS and critical apps, and buy other traditional SSD drives or HDD for archiving later. Drives scale very well - having more not only increases storage, but also I/O times, even without RAID. (130-180$) GPU - unfortunatly, Ryzen has no integrated GPU, so just buy used  GTX 960 or 1060 for 100-150$ and you will even have decent gaming experience on most titles in 1080p. Or go cheap and buy anything that lets you plug DP / HDMI. Radeon RX 550 is also a good choice - it's cheap, yet you will be able to play more than tetris.   Overall cost of components from above: 400$ - 550$. If you do not have PSU and case, you'll need at least PSU. Use this calculator to get Wattage when you will decide on components: https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator . PSU is quite important so do not go with shady brands.  This was team Red. Now Intel build:   SSD - the same: Samsung 500GB 970 EVO M.2 or ADATA 480GB M.2 PCIe XPG GPU - none (!). You save buck here and have empty slot for future. Nice. 8 GB of DDR4 ram   And now for the fun part:    CPU - Intel i5-8600 3.10GHz 9MB. It has 6 physical (!) cores and costs around 240$. CPU is the no. 2 bottleneck for dev work, so you will appreciate this CPU a lot. It has a neat Intel UHD Graphics 630 integrated, though this GPU has 4-7 times lowe performance than the ones suggested in Red build. But you can always buy dedicated GPU, would you like to play some new tripple A titles. If money are the issue here consider i3-8350. Both CPUs come with stock cooler. Mo-Bo: ex. MSI Z370-A PRO. But as usual: take into account: 4 slots for RAM, M2 slot with NVMe support, USB ports number and version, audio card and chipset. If you do not plan on overclocking consider chipset H370 like in ASRock H370 Pro4. As you can see, the 8th generation of Intel processors is complemented by 3xx Mo-Bos. The higher the letter (B, H, Z) the better the chipset is = the more PCI-e lanes you have and more customizable the build is. Overall cost of components from above: 470$ - 650$. And again - at least PSU. Case can be handy though too. Do not worry buying used case or RAM. Do NOT buy used PSU.
If you could get in theory get a mac with exact the same specifications, it wouldn't be a problem.  You can see two intel CPUs with at least some similarities (I don't know if the second was used in a mac, but I doubt it)   A intel CPU produced in 2008 Intel Core 2 Extreme Q9000 4 Cores, 2.0GHz, 45nm, 6MB Cache A intel CPU produced in 2016 Intel Xeon E3-1578L v5 4 Cores, 2.00GHz, 14nm, 8MB Cache   although the number of cores and and the base clock speed is the same, the newer CPU is more efficient (8 Threads, Turbo speed of 3.4GHz, integrated Graphics, smaller Lithography)   The reason newer OSX do not run on older macs is that the required drivers are not included in the OS or if they are, the OS requires higher CPU speed, or....  As time goes on apps/OS/etc. require faster CPUs, more Memory, better graphics, etc.
You'd probably need a    HDMI to HDMI + Audio like this. This one should be coupled with a RCA Male to 3.5mm adapter example.   with this setup you also need two HDMI cables.
OK, three part answers:  I am unaware of SPF(+) to copper interfaces. That does not mean that they do not exits. If they do exist then compatability is not a guarantee, so a call to HP is probably a good idea. If only to get an article number to search further on, since I expect the HP price to be 'not low'.    Based on the goal that you just need two additional 1 GbE ports: Swap the card. PCI-e cards with 2 or even 4 interface to regular copper are common, relative cheap and just work.  I linked to two potential cards, but theere are many more than just these two:  I/O Crest 4 Port Gigabit Ethernet Intel i350-AM4 Chipset PCI-E X4 Mentions server 2012 support on the box.  Quad 1GBit Intel PRO/1000 VT Quad Port Server Adapter LP PCI-E EXPI9404VT  2 more ports and is still affordable.    For future compatability and less down time (e.g. not swapping to a newer card if you get a more capable switch in the next year or two), try regular copper cards with higher speeds.  There are now desktop cards which support old format (100/1000mbit), but also 2&frac12;Gbit, 5Gbit and 10Gbit. Those could be used at the old speed with the current switch, and with a more modern switch you could do higher speeds.   Some more notes: We have at least two generations of these cards already, and that the older ones draw a relative high amount of power. That makes this a trade off between adding a classic 1GBit multiport card now and upgrading later. Or spending a relative large amount now and having less downtime later.  Modern DP proliants (G9 or G10) often come with something called 'flexible LOM', where you can choose for native 10Gbit rather than for a few 1Gbit ports.    Quick googling finds a few examples of 10Gbit copper, but at not entirely trivial prices.   One of which seems suitable for a server with high internal airflow and no single point of failure fan.    And as always:    Check what fits (Full height? Low height?), Check for drivers for your OS. Check for known compatability issues (sometimes servers are a lot more sensitive) And check if you have any special needs. E.g. explicit support for the cards in ESX is something I would mention if you not already told use you used Windows server 2012.
While the production year might not be relevant, new features introduced after a certain period might be required.  Nordis already mentioned CPU efficiency, but if you dive down to components you will also see newer instruction which are only available on newer CPU, more modern firmwares (UEFI) ect. etc.   All of which are not available on older hardware.  If the software is compiled to use these then they simply require those features. ... and Apple could mention that in specific jargon and be technically correct.   But given that this is Apple, and their average target audience it makes sense to put it in an easy to understand way, even if it is not 100% technical perfect.  Much in the same way a city might require a car which to be at most 20 years old, but actually mean any car that has a catalytic convertor.
Max Products has a variety of keycaps and does custom keycaps.  On their order page for customization it says: "Upload your design using our print template gives you total control on your own text/icon. We support both Adobe illustrator or Inkscape (SVG) format.".  If you want: "... keys that look just like my normal keycaps (i.e. only the letter is translucent) but with something like dots instead of the letters." - it looks like they can do it.  They also manufacture complete working keyboards of various styles and different layouts for different countries. Here's an example of a keyboard with semi-transluscent characters:
i7 8550u has twice the core count/threads, higher IPC, higher boost (which matters more as in intensive task it will turbo boost and not stay within stock clocks) and fair better in benchmark. Despite 8th gen being more power hungry, U chips should not eat up too many battery life. 9 hours of surfing web for HP X360 i5 7500u and around 8 hours for the 8th gen counterpart  Cinebench gets almost twice the points on  Multi core:   And some substantial increase from single core:   Also, if you game on intel's HD graphics, be aware it's not the best choice and Fortnite isn't the lightest game to run, that is if you keep your expectations low and lower some settings/resolutions. Both processor run Intel HD 620 so the difference should not be far off. If you want, there are laptops with low powered MX130/150 graphics that isn't going to increase price a lot and does pretty well Link to a review for HD 620
I believe the main difference is hard drive durability/life time. Depending on the series of the Samsung SSD, the pro sometimes have faster read and write. The newest 850 series in particular does not seem to be all that different in performance with the exception of write speed.  In general, the EVO series are going to be much better value, and usually the better option. Personally, if I was willing to spend the money on a 850 Pro series, I would just go with the 960 evo NVMe M.2 SSD if you have the interface to support it. It's MSRP is lower and it actually outperforms the 850 pro by a huge margin.  EDIT: I double checked and actually the 970 EVO is the latest of that series and it's market value is lower than the 960 and faster to boot. My points don't change, however.
If you liked the Logitech M570 they now have the MX Ergo Plus, it has received favorable reviews with some minor complaints; price being the biggest concern.  There's also the Elecom M-XPT1MRBK for a lower price, receiving favorable mention in the above review. The red trackball isn't for show, it improves the sensor's tracking.
HP Officejet 100 $356.99     Rate: 22 ppm Resolution: 1200 dpi Connective technology: USB, Bluetooth Printer Technology: Colorized Thermal Inkjet Supported Paper Formats: Letter (8.5" x 11"), A 4/5/6, Legal, Executive, Statement, B5 (JIS)   This is the cheapest printer I could find that comes with bluetooth and wasn't one of those tiny consumer HP camera printers. As an addition note, it appears this printer is portable as it comes equipped with a Lithium ion battery. They also sell a carrying case for this printer if you feel the need to print something in the middle of a park or something.
As you didn't provide what you need the camera for, I can just recommend some general cameras.   Ansice Camera this is ideal if you want to hide the camera. ($12.60) Raspberry Pi with camera You have to have some knowledge with Debian based Linux distributions to set this up, or follow a tutorial (very easy). (~$65) Boomlens Camera standard CCTV camera. ($16.85) Cambase Camera Ideal for outdoor surveillance with wall mount, supports HD. ($26) SV3C Camera Outdoor and indoor camera, FullHD, Waterproof, PoE(Power over Ethernet), infrared (Night vision). ($46)
You might look for a 2-Bay USB HDD case, for example the LOGILINK UA0154A.  There are plenty of casings around, see Google Shopping, but this depends on the size of your disks (2,5"; 3,5", ...). I would recommend two 2,5" SATA SSD's to get the best performance.  Edit: I really recommend to plug both drives to the same controller (let the "external hardware" do the RAID work for you).
You can try something like this http://www.ascendtech.us/lsi-sas9211-8i-6gb-s-raid-card-3wdv5_i_cntcrdlsi03wdv5.aspx?agent=froogle#  It has 2 visible connect which each support 4 hard drives through a cable which I suspect isn't included in the cost.  You easily get adaptec cards that will do the speed you want, but there all like $500-$1000 so I won't even waste your time with examples.    Forget controllers and all of that if all you want is speed.  I can get you the speed you need/want, but not the price. HERE   Here is a m.2 that meets your speed requirements From www.newegg.com:  It breaks the budget a bit, buts its name brand.   Samsung a bit more:     Want even faster:    You can get 2 cheaper ones and do a software RAID.
According to the featured products page on the DisplayLink website there is only one product with 3 or more video outputs at the moment, the Dell D6000.  The Kensington SD3650 is based on an older chip only supporting DisplayPort v1.1. I think I have a very similar device based on this chip and it doesn't work with MST. My Dell U2515H is also a bit unreliable with MST but your mileage may vary with newer products. At worst you'd have to go back to connecting 3 displays to the dock separately, 2 through DP and one through HDMI. It may be a wiser choice to plan for that and capability to output at least WQHD.  I can't find details in the manual about MST support or the supported DP profile level, but it should work.  Since you're not going for monitors that use USB Type-C or Thunderbolt 3 for video, USB and power you will still have a few cables at the desk and some of the better DP cables are quite thick. Sorry but I don't think you can get a reliable solution on the market today. I'd love to see it too, and also compatible and affordable KVM switches.  Final note: if you are using f.lux/redshift you may want to check. I think I saw a comment by the f.lux developers that they got it working with DisplayLink chips after years of having no support, but I haven't checked since.
If you are going for cloud solution, processing power is the main concern, as opposed to the network bandwidth - which would be primary concern if you'd be buying server yourself. The throughput you specify should be easily handled by any modern PC. Let's focus on the peak throughput - you calculated it is 23 messages/min, let's make it 100 for a pessimistic scenario. As the single outgoing message is at max 10MB, that means a pessimistic 1GB/min ~= 17 MB/s.  For minimal requirements & recomendation:  CPU: I would reccomend any at least quad physical core processor with benchmark value at least 10 000 here: https://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpus.html   RAM: the second most important component. I would recommend 8GB minimum - it will depend though on what distro you choose and specific software. Also - you mentioned databse, yet you said you will not be storing the e-mails - the database caching can take considerable amount of RAM, so if you plan on using databse only for logging, 8GB should suffice, but not for much more.  Mo-Bo, PSU and other components are not a concern if you go with hosting.  Comparision, for the on-site server:  So with a budget less than 200$ a month, you can calculate, that 2000$ server will reach a full ROI compared to hosting provider after 10 months, excluding electricity and upkeep cost.  Would you like to include electricity and faulty drive(s) swap: The electiricty cost can be estimated at around 400$ per year serverpowerusage. This makes 12 months of ROI. According to this article you can expect 0.1 failure rate in two years per drive ~= 1 faulty drive in twenty years. This is negligible.  Also, you need to calculate the cost of man-hours to setup and maintain, and theese are the biggest. There is also a bigger chance of data loss and problems, would you forget abiout spare PSU, ECC RAM or disk swap. You need to calculate it yourself.  Would you consider buying the server, that's what I'd reccomend paying attention to:  CPU - it's not a bottleneck in this usage scenario assuming you buy any decent new server, but the older platform you will get, the more troubles in the future you will have upgrading. I'd say go with latest chipset, leave one socket empty and buy cheapest XEON for the second. It will be idle anyways most of the time.  RAID support and hot plug of HDD and PSU is a must. Redundant PSU is a must also.   As for RAM - just remember to buy ECC ram - you have a server on site, so you can easilly increment. Start with one stick of 8GB or 16GB. More important is the board, which should have planty of space to add new RAM dies (12-24 ideally).  Whichever way you'll go: keep in mind the 3-2-1 backup mantra: 3 copies at 2 different media with one copy at different location.
Let me clean up the question a bit as I understand it first; you want a device that will give you internet capabilities for a browser and possibly some other applications (but mostly the browser).  It cannot have a wireless network interface component because you are concerned with infringing on company policies regarding wireless access within their networks (a mainframe is a very different thing and has nothing to do with wireless networking).     Before I answer, I'd like to point out that any company worth anything at all has abandoned the practice of forbidding wireless devices, as cell phones exist and are microcomputers with wireless network accessibility.  Any company with which you'd want to associate will have a modern philosophy about cybersecurity and prohibit unauthorized connections technologically so you don't have to worry about it.   You will be hard-pressed to find a notebook computer that doesn't have wireless LAN access.  Most motherboards have them built in and your only option to disable them is via the BIOS, which is effectively a secure way to make the machine behave as if it has no wireless card at all (since a BIOS hack is not a realistic problem).  All Chromebooks have WLAN access components.  Most laptops do not possess a normal network jack anymore and you'll need to get an external RJ45 port on a USB dongle to use physical networking lines.   Since laptops simply aren't made without WLAN capability anymore, your only option other than just disabling it yourself is to physically remove it yourself.  Some Dell Latitude and HP models have the card (the size of a small cracker) in a slot on the motherboard with two screws holding it down and antennae that lead to the monitor.  Disconnect the antennae wires, wrap their contacts in electrical tape, and remove the card.
There's a little trick you can use to get around this.  Get a USB extension cable.   Then plug the extension cable into a 2.x port (assuming your components are 2.x and don't lose performance on those ports) and plug the dongle into the other end.  This gives you the length to get the actual wireless receiver away from the interference from the USB3 ports.
In terms a fairly cheap option, take a look at the Logitech G203.  I like it because it has six buttons but looks like a regular mouse(not the gaming mice).  It works in Linux & Windows as long as you configure it in Windows initially.  I'm not sure about macOS.
I am sorry. I didn't realize this question hasn't got an official answer even though I bought a machine based on the comments. For what its worth, I bought an HP Eltebook 8470P with 256 GB SSD, 8 GB RAM. My Batch time got dropped from 14 hours or so to 5 hours. Has worked like a peach for 2 years till a couple of days back when its power adapter went kaput. Came here to ask about it only when notice this question lying unanswered. Thank everyone, though belated....
Its not exactly an NUC, but I ended up going with ars technica's recommendation and ordered something similar from Qotom (went with a core i3, 4gb of ram, and 128gb ssd, since I may choose to run other things on it - this is the specific model). They have more practical 2 port models, but it seemed like a good idea at the time. I paid about 280USD, which compares well to a NUC, even if its slightly dated hardware.  I'm planning to run a few other things on it, and I'm still working out the software setup. It comes with pfsense already installed.   A few little technical notes -  The wireless adaptor that comes built in is a  AR9287. Its single band, and probably something I will replace in future. Its mini PCIe not M.2. Its probably worth dropping and replacing with something else. I'm not sure if the option without wireless comes with the mounting holes for the antennae so I left it in place.    It has a msata slot (populated by an off brand, presumably MLC drive), and a power+data interface.   It has 4x intel I211 adaptors (not multiple adaptors on one interface).  It has 4x USB (2x 2.0 2x3.0), Serial (which was slightly amusing) and HDMI out for video.  Its silent.      I'll take a beauty shot later, but that's in comparison with a NUC class machine.
Your HDD is a Western Digital Scorpio Blue WD5000BEVT 500GB. In the first picture it seems that the HDD is wrapped in something. If this is the case, remove this piece.  You can read your HDD's full specs on cnet or newegg.  Its interface is SATA 3 Gb/s - 7 pin Serial ATA. Looks for this in your favorite vendor.
It really depends on how deep you want to go when it comes to your deep learning projects, and how long you are willing to wait, which could be a long time- depending on your project and how much computing it requires to output qualitative results.   My primary workstation is a Dual E5-2697 v2, 128 GB RAM, Dual TITAN GPUs, and an 8x1TB SSD RAID 0 Array over SAS. It's a workhorse; the CPU rates 22000 using Passmark and is in the 99th Percentile. The 2X GPUs rate at 92nd Percentile...   That said, it's a heavy duty system (The original build was roughly $20,000- though it could be built now using the same components and buying used for far less)- but it even wouldn't really be a "great" system for workload heavy deep learning setups, such as video/image/audio projects.   Your best bet would be to buy a good system, I would say don't buy "best", but 6 months post release- it's so much cheaper that way. Go single processor, highest OC you can afford, and a decent GPU.   Then use the money saved to run your actual deep learning projects on Google Cloud Compute or Amazon's AWS.   You can build your VM Instance on Google's Cloud Compute Platform, keep it off which will only incur minimal charges for the IP and system image; then power it up with 1, 2, 4, or even multiple VMs running NVIDIA V100 GPUs.   The V100s will really give you the power you want and while the 2080 card may appear nearly as fast on benchmark charts, it simply can't do what a V100 can, such as FP64, it can host 32GB of RAM which vastly improves it's ability to handle large data sets rather than having to pipe in and out smaller subsets, and you can rent them at the pre-emptable price of roughly $0.80 per hour. (GPU only)  The 2080 may be touted as "80% as fast" as a V100 but if your project would benefit from FP64 and larger ram allocations, it will rip past what your 2080 can do- it's why the card costs 8 times what a single 2080 is priced at.   Add to that you can instantly launch a 2 x V100, or 4x V100 VM Instance, and suddenly you are machine learning speeds are 20x, 30x, or far more, than what your system could do.   Ultimately, it will boil down to:  I can run this machine learning project on my system and obtain the results I want in 9 days, OR, I can launch a VM, pay $8.00 an hour, and get my results back in 7 hours.   Using this method you can build your projects on your system, then when you actually are ready to let the machine go to work and do the work, you can put your VM online, transfer your project and assets, and put the V100s to work for a few hours, or a few days.   But a high end deep learning system on Google's platform - using the pre-emptable price; may cost you $4 an hour; what it will be able to do in 12 hours will far surpass what you would be able to do in days, if not weeks and weeks of runtime.   The cost of one V100 is over $8000. Save the cash, rent the cards by the minute when you need them. And costs will drop as newer cards become available.
For updates I would focus on phones with Android One - they are guaranteed two years of updates and that's guaranteed by Google themselves (plus it's pretty close to pure Android). And no stupid vendor customisations to the ROM (e.g. MIUI).  Reading your requirements look at Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite. It has great battery life (both in tests and from my friend's comments), is a recent phone and is part of the Android One program.  One thing to look at when it comes to battery life is the SoC - AFAIK Snapdragon 625 (and it's updates) are really good for battery life.  Two sites I can recommend for solid reviews are notebookcheck and GSMarena. They go a bit more in depth in their reviews.
I currently own a Dell XPS 13 (Developer edition) 16GB RAM, 256 GB SSD. I ran Windows 10 on it for a year, switched to Ubuntu 18.04 for 4 months, and switched back to Windows 10.  Pros:   It is very lightweight and low-profile It can do common tasks with ease such as browsing, word-processing, etc. I normally have around 40-50 tabs open in Google Chrome.   Cons:   Because it is such a small profile, the case is the cooling system. When running CPU-intensive programs, I can burn my legs from the heat of the aluminum case. In Ubuntu, I could not work on the laptop while it was charging because Ubuntu thought the laptop was overheating and the CPU would throttle.   If I could go back and buy another laptop, I would look for something slightly bigger with a better cooling system. Also, the Dell XPS 13 has a CPU that is intended for mobile products. Even though it says Intel core i7, it's not your normal core i7. Lookup i7-8550u for specs. Here is a current link : https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/processors/core/i7-processors/i7-8550u.html
Video editing and rendering is mostly multithreaded, so if frequency obviously matters, core & thread count is the most important.  That is why GPU can be a good solution too. If you planned to put a GPU anyway, that could be an option for faster renderering as a GPU has way more cores than a CPU. In this case, I would recommend a "cheap" 6 cores like the Ryzen 2600, depending on your budget of course, with a good GPU.
Nokia 2.1  Decent build quality for the money. 4000 mAh battery. No frills. Monthly security support promise for at least three years.
Intel has just released 9th gen core I which only has partial fixes. AMD also released their CPUs recently although AFAIK they were never susceptible to Meltdown. All in all - I'd say a year at least.  What do you do on your notebook that you care so much about performance? Could you please update your question?  Update  After reading question update:  Whatever new you get now will be most likely a major step up. Your old notebook likely has an HDD - those 2.5" 5400 RPM HDDs are way slow. Also get loads of RAM - code completion eats it like candies, faster then any browser. CPU only comes later (unless you have some very specific needs which you failed to note).  Both Spectre and Meltdown countermeasures exhibit the greatest hit on the user/kernel border - which usually boils down to network or disk I/O. Unless you do a lot of that the performance hit should be <5% for you - that's almost neglible. Browsing the net while compiling could cause more of a slow down.
The Microsoft Surface Pro (5th Generation) is a very good laptop (tablet) with a detachable screen and keyboard as specified.  As far as specs go, they cover your requirements with a model which has:   Intel Core i7. 512 GB / 1 TB SSD. 16 GB RAM. 12.3" Display.   There is a stylus available for the Surface Pro and as far as build quality goes, the Surface Pro is exceptional, as would be expected from a high-end Microsoft product.  You can find more details here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro/8NKT9WTTRBJK/L6FV?source=lp&activetab=pivot:techspecstab  The price of the 512 GB model is $2200 (currently $1799 as of this post).  This is probably one of the best choices out there for programming / note-taking.
Huffer posted an excellent response on (https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/WLAN-Module-Recommendations/td-p/6872092)  He said that there are no AC-Compatible wi-fi chips available on my model number Dv7 due to a blacklisting of all other wi-fi chips that are non-manufacturer approved.  He also said that certain models are whitelisted and don't have this lack of forward compatibility.
While I don't know what country you're in so I can't be sure of this suggestion, these offerings are available on UK Amazon (1) (2).   I found these with a search for "Short HDMI Cable 0.1m". There were a lot of offerings at 0.25m, but these were the only ones I could see shorter than that.
I don't believe that the thing you're searching for is possible at this time. While there are external NFC addons, they are (as far as I know) designed for taking payments rather than mimicking general NFC android capabilities. (Details and store page for one of these) The problem you run into is that some "flavours" of android (the modified versions used by individual device manufacturers were not designed for NFC, so adding the functionality is nigh on impossible. If you have settings for NFC in your device menus, there might be chance and further investigation could be worth it.   If you do decide to keep investigating, while I couldn't easily find one currently for sale, there are many NFC modules designed for a micro SD slot, however be careful with these as it seemed unclear whether they were intended to add NFC functionality or if they were simply standard micro SD cards which allow a person to access the files on it through NFC.
Here are G-Sync HDR equipped 1440p, IPS monitors that can ship to the UK today (I gleaned this off your profile). I could only find monitors that come with 165 Hz, but if it is an absolute necessity you have 144, you can set this in your operating system. The technical specs seems pretty much the same so take your pick of brand. Be ready to drop some serious cash if you want monitors with these exact specs.

Ultimately I did buy the Dell U2718Q, when it was on sale.  Very happy with it.  My laptop and the U2718Q are both capable of 3840x2160, but I'm running them at 2560x1600.  U2718Q via the mini display port cable it shipped with.  The text size and sharpness works well for me.
this is indeed a PCIe slot (x16).  The built-in GPU could possibly make it for low/medium settings but if you want high / play to other games, I would recommand a little card like a 1050Ti (roughly 170â‚¬ / 160Â£ / 170$).  However, you have to know that this CPU is not the best for gaming and could limit with games relying a lot on CPU.
Rx 560 and Gtx 1050Ti are way to go according to your needs but your processor doesn't seem to get full use of these graphics card if possible upgrade to minimum ryzen 3 or intel i3 otherwise you can get 40+ fps on high settings with your amd apu buy any of them which is cheaper in your country and you can see benchmarks on YouTube with your apu paired with these two Gpus.
I would suggest doing the 4x16GB kit for the memory, it gives better performance, and it leaves room to upgrade and buy more RAM!   Linus Tech Tips did a video a while back where he tested the different RAM speeds, I think he recommended 2400MHz, but 3200MHz should be fine  I've put your build into a site called PC part picker that is able to check compatibility and such, so you are able to find a case that fits your budget, style, and motherboard. But yes there are a couple mid tower cases that will fit your motherboard   https://pcpartpicker.com/list/vKHQMZ  Since your already paying so much for a computer you might as well get the newest line of graphics cards, and as a side note many games aren't supporting SLI anymore. But the 2080 TI does support SLI, so if you want buy another graphics card in the future you will be able to run it in SLI. But this is really up to you  PC part picker will help you find a cooling solution as well, but you are going to want something beefy to cool your CPU  P.S. hopefully you have a 4k monitor or a 2k 144hz monitor to take advantage of all this hardware
If you didn't want to keep the same monitors, you could use something like Mouse Without Borders.  A KVM switch would also do the trick.
Since you are going to upgrade your CPU, you should consider AMD. I don't know what problems you encountered in the past, but the latest Ryzen CPUs are well worth their price.  I had the same hesitation but I bought the 2700X to give it a try - paired with an x470 board. It's a beast, it can do rendering, streaming, gaming, all at the same time. I believe it's the most VFM option these days - hands down. And the best part is some new AMD technologies that allow the CPU to reach its maximum overclock abilities automatically, without tweaking a single setting. (note: I am affiliated with this site)  Intel has a bad availability these days, so prices have gone way high for their value. That said, a 8700K would also cover your needs - consider it being the same as 2700X performance-wise.
The graphics card is what will help you to play the game without problems. For CPUs you can consider:   AMD 2600X i5 8600K   But you also want a strong GPU, at least a GTX 1060.
Get : Ryzen 5 1600 B450 Motherboard (Probably from ASROCK or anything with beafy VRMs) 16GB DDR4 3000Mhz (You can probably overlock them) Radeon 580 or GTX 1060 (Or something similar) Get a 128GB SSD (Boot Drive) and a 1TB HDD  That should be pretty much it. Not sure tho.
Mmmm The More amount of RAM = Better Performance  So Technically try fill to out as many memory slots you can with most amount of memory you can put in.  With Ryzen CPUs you would want to get some Pretty High Speed RAM (You know Infinity Fabric)  And Mid Tower cases should be fine. And Yeah Hopefully they should be fine for next few years but why not get a RTX 2070 ???   And Yeah EKC Does some have some good kits but as you said its been a long time. You can get anything with soft tubing as they are easier to handle than Hard tubing.
So I found this on the search https://huddlecamhd.com/usb2air/  Which pretty much do what I asked for..  Unfortunately its only for windows and very bulky so a better answer is still appreciated.
The 2700x, as you know, has XFR and can make use of PBO, and according to reports, this means that manually overclocking is basically a thing of the past.   Not quite, XFR is still better than OC Genie, AI Suite, etc, but not as good as manual OC.     However, most boards, if you listen to at least some of the pros, have an insufficient power setup to properly supply the 2700x through to it's best (4.3ghz).   It's not only a problem of power capability but also a problem of power dissipation on low end cards. The power drawn is not huge, Tom's Hardware got 150W in extreme testing with AVX and 1.475V, which is not the reality. I would go even go further and assume that power dissipation is more an issue than MOSFETs power capabilities, on most cards.  From what I've quickly seen, the 4xx (unlike 3xx) from Gigabyte seem to have decent dissipators on MOSFETs, Asrock too. But anyway, if there's no OC, any decent card would be sufficient even with BT, Wifi and an Rx 580 unless you run it in a closed shoebox.
The M.2 slot requires and x4 pcie equivalent to have enough bandwidth to function at the expect speed. The chipset has a limit to how many pcie lanes are physically available. Some of the lanes are dedicated to other devices. Physically space requirements as most M.2 lay flat down against the motherboard.  each one is approx 22.1 by 80.26 =2.75 square inches if you want a dozen that is 33 square inches.  The ATX size clearly doesn't allow for a CPU, and squeezing RAM on there would be tricky at best.   EATX probably has enough room for a CPU and maybe RAM, but nothing else.  Since the northbridge chipset requires active cooling there is no room for it under the M.2's.  SSI MEB would have enough room and I don't think those are very common.  WTX  would have enough room, but I don't know how common they are.      So screws may secure them into place.   5.  You can't place them close to the PCIe slots due to potential pcie card over hang.  Cards like this allow 2 in 1 pcie slot  Silverstone SST-ECM22 Dual M.2 to PCI-E X4 NVMe SSD/SATA 6G Adapter https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwiMq7y8hLbeAhWFJmkKHSq4D_4YABAZGgJpcQ&sig=AOD64_3t6MTcwHm1WdEACCQOhozV3m3Kgg&ctype=5&q=&ved=0ahUKEwi-47e8hLbeAhVrw4MKHTKOA2E4ZBDYKQiIAw&adurl=  https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=17Z-00A1-00081
I have a Bosch DLR165, which appears to have been produced around 2010. It's possible that I purchased mine that far back, or from eBay in later years. I found only one in today's eBay listing, but based on my experience with this one, I'd purchase a newer Bosch product with confidence.  The manual lists the maximum range at 50 meters, within your requirements. The manual also states a minimum of 50 millimeters. This I checked moments ago. I cannot attest to the precision/accuracy, but can confirm that when placed on a metric ruler, it reads 50 mm. I used an uncalibrated eyeball to place the tool and the opposite surface, but suggest that it would be within the specified 1.5 mm capability.   When moved one mm closer, an error message appeared.  For a different type of test, I measured the span of my door frame. The top and bottom measured 2 mm narrower than the center of the vertical section of the door. When I placed the aforementioned ruler under the tool (1.9 mm thick), the measurement was reduced by 2 mm, indicating that my door frame is warped and that the tool recognized the distance change. Repeated measurements resulted in consistent results.  This specific unit meets the "nice to have" list as well. As noted in the manual, there is a trigonometric mode that requires one to measure the two legs of a right triangle and the device will calculate the hypotenuse. I have not tested this feature, but have confidence that it will work as described.  I have used the continuous measuring mode as well. It is unremarkable in operation and works fine.  Bosch has a reputation (in my alleged mind) of creating quality products. It's certainly possible that this device and others from the same company would be made in China, but in such cases, oversight results in expected quality. A not-necessarily-marketing blah-blah review can be found at The Gadgeteer from which the image below has been presented.    The photo shows "Assembled in Malaysia" invalidating my China reference, but that was 8 years ago.
So far the lightest monitors I have found are, ordered by increasing weight:  21.5-inch:   Acer S220HQL Abd 21.5-Inch Widescreen LCD Monitor: DVI/VGA (no HDMI), 1920 x 1080. Specifications (mirror) 1.86 kg (=4.10 lbs) (unclear if it's without  or with stand). HP 22er 21.5-inch Display (mirror): HDMI/VGA, 1920 x 1080 @ 60 Hz, 2.07 kg (=4.56 lbs) (without stand), 2.44 kg (=5.38 lbs) (with stand).   23-inch:   Acer S230HL 23-Inch 1080p Widescreen LED LCD Monitor (Black). Specifications (mirror):   Without stand - width: 21.6 in - depth: 1.3 in - height: 13.1 in - weight: 2.3 kg (=5.1 lbs) With stand - width: 21.6 in - depth: 6.6 in - height: 15.1 in - weight: 2.4 kg (=5.3 lbs). I confirmed the weight on one such monitor I purchased.  AOC - 24B1H 23.6" LED FHD Monitor (Amazon,  newegg), which weights 2.6 kg (= 5.7 lbs). From the official specifications (mirror): "Net weight excl package kg: 2.6 Kg". It costs between 110 USD and 150 USD, signal input is (HDMI 1.4 x 1, VGA), and resolution is 1920x1080.   24-inch:   Sceptre E246BV-FC 24" LED HDTV Display 1920x1080 Full HD HDMI VGA USB, True Black (2017); Specifications (mirror): HDMI/VGA, weight: 2.44 kg (=  5.39 lbs) with stand, 2.22 kg (= 4.89 lbs) without stand. Note: has bad reviews on Amazon (3.4/5 score). SCEPTRE E248W-1920R 24-inch: 16:9, HDMI/VGA, Blue Light filter,  weight: 2.6 kg (= 5.77 lbs) with stand, 2.42 kg (= 5.33 lbs)  without stand.     Note that the weight information is often incorrect on Amazon. In most cases, this is due to unit errors, e.g. 5 kg in the official specifications becomes 5 lbs on Amazon. Examples of products with such issues:   Dell S Series S2719DM 27" Ultrathin Monitor: advertises 8.88 lbs but instead is ~8kg. Same issue with the Dell SE2717H and the Dell S2419H.  Sceptre E248W-1920R 24 Inch Ultra Thin 1080p 75Hz LED Monitor HDMI VGA, Metal Black 2018:  this Amazon page claims that the weight is 5 lbs, however the official specifications (mirror) mention a slightly heavier weight: 5.77 lb With Stand, 5.33 lb Without Stand. ViewSonic VP2771 Professional 27" 1440p Monitor USB Type C 100% sRGB Rec709 14-bit 3D: this Amazon page claims that the weight is 6.8 lbs, however the official specifications  (mirror) mention the weight (with the stand) is 6.8 kg.   Amazon tends to reject reviews that point to those issues. As a result, when looking for weight information, one has to double check on the manufacturer's official website, which typically has  for each product one technical specification page specifying the weight.    I contacted the customer services of a few monitor manufacturers to ask for their lightest monitors:   AOC (http://us.aoc.com/en/contact-sales): I'm waiting for their reply. Dell (https://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/campaigns/chat-splitter): I was told that the Dell 24 Monitor | E2417H (5.77 kg) is their lightest monitor. Spectre (http://www.sceptre.com/ -> Live Chat): I'm waiting for their reply.
It is indeed an ambiguous wording, but it definitly means that Athlon / 7th gen APU will only allow SATA mode and others will allow both.  So you won't be limited to SATA with your A1000 with a 2600X.
Physically, it works. 7300HQ and 7700HQ are both FCBGA 1440 socket, so they are in theory compatible, but the package is soldered to the PCB and changing it can be really hard due to the precision of the needed solders, as Jan mentionned.  There are still few concerns:   Changing CPU may change power dissipation needs, which is a stumbling block on laptops. It may also change power consumption as well, same problem. Bios may prevent from changing CPU.   The first two shouldn't be problems considering that the 7300HQ and the 7700HQ have the same TDP even though the i7 may draw a bit more power and heat up a bit more too.  For the last concern, it depends on your laptop.
You could use a commercially available screen cleaning kit like this one from Amazon.  You could also potentially use a soft microfiber cloth with water and a tiny amount of dish soap (put the slightly soapy water directly on the cloth and not the screen and make sure the cloth is only damp and not dripping wet).  Make sure you do NOT USE abrasive or astringent cleaners as they can permanently damage your screen.
It's a bit of a bet, but I'd go with E3-1225v6.  Two reasons:   Image processing is, by it's very nature, memory-bound. Meaning RAM speeds matter A LOT. 8MB of cache could, at best, fit a single 2MP 24 BPP image  Assuming your software supports it: AVX2
Soldering BGAs is hard even for machines. Reworking a new one in place of an old one manually is harder. Getting one from an old board to a new one is nigh impossible.  BGA stands for ball grid array. While many Intel documents are not public, BGA itself is an industry standard. Those devices come with tiny solder balls attached to them which then get deformed when soldered to the board. And when you put the processor on a new board it might turn out there is not enough solder on some pins.  Also: this requires superb precision. Looking at the datasheet for the i7-8650U which is also FCBGA has a minimum pitch (distance between two neighbouring balls) stated as 0.914mm. Which means you need to place the processor accurately down to about 0.5mm. With no obvious reference point. If it seems hard that's because it is.  As an anecdote: someone I know, who is the best in our company when it comes to soldering, once soldered a device with similar package. A bit finer pitch, waaaay less balls and these were brand new ICs. Out of three only one worked.
Out of these CPUs (and ignoring considerations other then performance), it's a toss-up between the e3-1225v6 and e3-1270v2.  In terms of raw power, the e3-1270 has about a 10% edge because of it's hyperthreading and faster clock speed - see https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/Intel-Xeon-E3-1225-v6-vs-Intel-Xeon-E3-1270-V2/3019vs1192 and https://ark.intel.com/compare/65727,97476 - they have similar instruction sets.  That said at this level the external factors come into play - eg memory size, cache, SSD/hdd performance. Depending on the types of manipulation, CPU offload might come in to play.
The biggest performance e increase  would be to replace the hdd with an SSD. Any SATA SSD should work - I like Samsung EV8x0 series (where x is the generation, it won't matter too much which gen).  The size you get will depend on how full your hdd is and budget, but a 250 or 500 gig should suffice.  Increasing memory will help significantly, but will slightly reduce the battery life. An SSD will likely help more (because it reduces swap times and greatly decreases file access and write times). Doing both will help more.  Not much else to upgrade on a laptop in terms of performance.
As davidgo stated, the best upgrade you can do on a notebook for that kind of work is the SSD, it will help a lot when working with large projects, apart from the general responsiveness. It can also help in scenarios where RAM memory is just barely not enough for what you are doing, since paging is much faster on flash memory.  Updrading to 8GB is also advisable, but i suspect doing that alone will not make a big difference. I would upgrade this alongside with the SSD, since DDR3L memory is quite affordable this days. You can check your memory usage in the Task Manager, unless is near 100% most of the time you are not limited by that.  Unfortunately there is not much more you can do, since the vast majoriry of current notebooks (yours included) have the CPU soldered, the other major upgrade point for your work.
I would go for an AM3+ mobo considering that it's pretty cheap, I've seen your mobo at ~50â‚¬ in France. Of course it depends on your country.  Changing mobo + CPU + ram is expensive nowadays, if your CPU is still enough for you, keep it a bit more.
Based in its CPU benchmark score, this CPU gives middle-of-the-road performance, but it is 6 years old.  That said, performance increases over time have slowed a lot.  If your system is able to fo everything you need  it to and your usage case is unlikely to change in the next 12 months or more, and the motherboard is less then $100, it's financially reasonable to replace the motherboard and defer a new purchase.
As an owner of Viotek GN34C that has a 1440x3440 resolution I can say that it is really amazing and a huge upgrade from 1080 and from standard 16:9. It is very easy to open two programs or web pages side by side, without running into all sorts of weird layout issues that you get on a 16:9 monitors. Definitely worth it.   Other than Viotek I can suggest you to look at something like Samsung CF791, Samsung C34J791 or Microboard M340CLZ, as they all have WQHD VA panels manufactured by Samsung and might be cheaper depending on your location, but keep in mind that original Samsung monitors use Quantum Dot technology, which other similar monitors don't have.  You would need a DisplayPort cable to make use of the 100Hz refresh rate, though, or at least HDMI 2.0 to run it at 60Hz.  If you are going to be using it with a modern business laptop you shouldn't see any problem with running programs in WQHD, but it would struggle to run modern games with decent FPS.
In order to hear sounds around you in a proper manner, consider that bone conduction headphones will leave your ears open, while allowing you to enjoy music or other sounds. This type of design also allows your ear's natural direction finding characteristics to function, as very little of the surrounding ear is blocked by bone conduction headphones.  I've used two different types and the wireless ones are certainly the most convenient.   In some states, it is unlawful to have earbuds or earphones, but bone conduction designs do not block the ear and are not unlawful, although it may be necessary to explain to an uninformed uniformed law enforcement officer of the difference.  I've owned two models of AfterShokz and can recommend them for quality sound and functionality.  There's a review of a few models and manufacturers here: https://www.everydayhearing.com/hearing-technology/articles/bone-conduction-headphones/ that may be useful in your decision process.
It is true, DP is a little better (e.g., it supports a higher refresh rate); however, regardless of which one you end up going with, the differences between DisplayPort and HDMI are not very major.  Unless you have some technical reasons why one would be preferred over another (e.g. you're running several of these screens, which would overload the CPU, and you need the one with the least CPU usage), either one works just fine, as long as your screen can play the sound which your computer sends. (some lower quality screens have trouble playing HDMI sound)  And for the second part of your question, the negatives to connecting different resolutions are also quite minor.  For example, when you need to move from one window to the other, you'll be able to move your mouse to, e.g. upper right corner to switch to the other screen, but moving your mouse to the lower right corner will not move it over to the other screen (or vice versa).  However, that is quite a minor disadvantage, and for all practical purposes, you should be fine.
Just to identify some issues with your setup:     Power supply:   The whole thing should run 24/7, so a low power profile would be good to not drain the car battery too much.   Running it at night requires an IR LED to be on.  Being able to see 20m would require this LED to be insanely bright, hence not very low-power.  If you want to use only street lights, you would be better off with setting up a Raspberry Pi device to take long-exposure photos at set intervals, instead of a video.  Then, long exposure means you can forget the clarity requirement.  Again, the power requirements would be immense; I recommend EV batteries to run this, since they typically have a quite high power-to-weight ratio.  Maybe two or three, if you're going to be gone a week at a time: depends how you set up the rest of the peripherals.  So, also forget about being low-cost.     Cameras:   Cabling should be simple, so best everything on 12 volts and I think the cables to the recorder could get as long as 6-8 meters.   Again, keep in mind that, the longer the cable, the more the voltage depression.  I ran 3-meter-long cables in my car, and already I had to run them 8-gauge to be able to run my equipment without problem at 40 degrees C.  They'd need to be even thicker to work at 90 degrees.     Should connect to the wireless network while I am near home and record the data directly onto a home server and transfer all recorded data too.   I believe this directly contradicts your requirement best would be if it works without sending a signal.  And again, you'd have a lot of programming to do, to make this work with the Raspberry Pi.  No general-purpose recording software will be developed with such attributes, until the market for it is large enough.     Storage:   Should survive shocks during car rides, so a spinning disk might be bad, but with 3 images per second(?!) that should be around 10 tera bytes of SSD??   Yes.  Keep in mind that most SSD's cannot be even stored at 90 degrees without losing their data -- much less working at those temperatures.  And spinning disks use too much electricity.  I should also mention that, typical EV batteries quickly degrade at temperatures higher than 40 degrees Celcius, except there is a high-temperature version of Saft EV batteries I've been able to find, which costs over ten thousand dollars per block.  In other words, the cost to make this setup work adds up.  If you happen to find a way to decrease your requirements to make this setup more realistic, I will be glad to help out with actual product recommendations.  For now, I believe your post is more hypothetical than practical.
The answer is no.  The thing is, that the more specialized you get, the more expensive hardware gets.  To give you an example, you can buy a 4-inch dye sub printer for roughly $150, a 6-inch for $1350, an 8-inch for $5000.  The less often a piece of machinery is used, the more expensive it gets.  This is why an 8-disk hub is so much more expensive than hooking up 8 separate DVD-R's to a computer.  Therefore, if you are only looking for something that can do many DVD's at once, there is a possibility that eventually, something might come out that would do the job.  However, if you also need it to be cheap, then this will not happen unless the market changes to where many people will all the sudden need 8-disc hubs, and they can be mass produced.  Which I believe you can agree to, will not happen in this day and age.
The name of the cable required for the boomerspeaker is a Figure-8 cable.  However, in the future, when posting such a question, it would help if you could include the image of what it is that you need.  It took a bit of searching to find a picture with the image of the power nest.  Finally found it on NewEgg. .
I don't have live experience with Vive.  However, the Vive FAQ says,      Important: Use only the same version of base stations together. Different base station versions are not interchangeable.    In other words, if Vive Pro accidentally detects the signal from a Base 1.0 station, it will cause significant interference.  The reason for that is, that the IR method of communication prevents Vive from locking on to a signal (which would be possible for it to do if the communication were entirely in BlueTooth).  Therefore, when another signal of the same frequency comes in, it will cause a disruption.  That being said, it's worthwhile to keep in mind that since IR is a more-or-less unidirectional signal, you still should be able to make it work if you are very careful to make sure that the signals from the two base versions do not intersect.  Theoretically anyways.  In practice, as I said, I never used Vive before, so it might be harder than it seems.  Let me know if this doesn't answer your question fully.  p.s., in the future, such questions belong on SuperUser.
If I understood you correctly, a "cell phone USB charger" is a power bank.  If that's right, then as far as I am aware, you have two options:   Buy a 20Ah charger that has multiple batteries inside, wired in parallel.  When you need 10Ah, take out half the batteries; when you need 20Ah, put them back in.  Example: 4 batteries inside. 3 batteries inside. 8 batteries inside (but you must take out 4 at a time). Buy two 10Ah power banks, and a two-to-one USB cable, which would allow to use both of them at the same time if that's what you need.  You can put them both in a single case, to make sure they stay as a unit.  Using both simultaneously is particularly useful if your device uses a lot of power.
I don't know if this is the same company from which I've purchased key caps in the past, but a quick search with the terms "replacement key cap omen 17 laptop" resulted in a number of links. One of the more promising links: Quickfix Laptop Keys provides a number of Omen model identifiers. It appears that you would get three pieces including the plastic hinge and the cup.
Reliance JioPhone 2  It might still be early days, but the Reliance JioPhone 2 feature phone from India might soon become a viable option for the smartphone haters among us.  As a matter of fact, Reliance is opening up shop in Estonia, taking out a European e-residency. Provided the appropriate LTE bands are supported, such a European JioPhone 2 might be perfectly usable in the US.  Reliance Jio is expected to become the 10th largest phone brand in the world.  As for the operating system, the closed-source KaiOS, runs  the Linux kernel and happens to be a far descendent of Firefox OS. KaiOS brings support for 4G LTE E, GPS and Wi-Fi with HTML5-based apps and longer battery life to non-touch devices with optimised user interface, less memory and energy consumption.  However, be aware that Google invested $22M in this feature phone operating system. By investing in KaiOS, Google ensures that core apps like Search, Maps, YouTube, and Assistant reach feature phone users. Google likely hopes that those users will grow dependent on the services, and that these users will eventually upgrade to Android smartphones.
First of all, I'd like to start by saying that the throw ratio for this projector = 0.133 is very good.  If you put a different lens on it, for example that can focus when 70cm away, then your image would be 210" wide.  In other words, you can get a larger image size simply by moving the projector farther from the wall, provided you can find a lens that can focus that distance.  The projector you posted is very, very good.  The bad thing is, that projector lenses are actually what comprise the majority of the price.  For example, if you look through the examples below, it seems that the lens needed to project such a wide image so close, itself can easily cost $5000 or more.  Therefore, if you can purchase a lens to project a 150" image with such a low throw ratio, for such a low price -- I'd take it.  However, in case you are truly dedicated to getting a larger image, I will outline your choices.  I checked the projectors on Tocopedia, and the below projectors are not available there; however, all of the below projectors are sold by companies which Tocopedia carries, so I suspect you can get them easier than some other products.  Option #1: you can buy the NEC PX803UL with a NP39ML lens.  As you can see, this would result in an image of 100 - 350 inches, with a Throw ratio of 0.38 : 1.  Option #2: the Hitachi HP-WU9750B or LP-WU9100B, with a FL-920 lens.  Again, this would result a Throw ratio of approximately 0.327, and an image of 100 - 350 inches.  Option #3: In case you can have a little bit of leeway, and mount your projector 2.1m away instead of 2m away, there is the Hitachi CP-SX12000 or CP-X10000J with the USL-801 lens.  Its Throw Ratio is 0.42, and it can project an image 40 - 700 inches.  This lens only costs $2500, which is pretty cheap, so it might be worth buying this lens first, and seeing whether you can retrofit it onto a cheaper projector.  The projector itself, although fairly expensive, actually has specs a little worse than the projector you posted.  For instance, for the SX12000 it's 1050x1400 pixels instead of 1920x1080, 2500:1 contrast ratio instead of 5000:1, etc.; the specs are even worse for the CP-X10000J.  But then again, the price of this projector is about half the price of #1 and #2.  Bottom line: I think that the projector you posted is very cheap, considering it has true HD, and such a high contrast ratio.  It is also about half the price of the last projector I posted, so is a good deal.  If you are willing to sacrifice image quality, and so much more money, in order to get a bigger image size, then projector #3 is your best choice.  But even then, I would buy the lens first, and only buy the projector if I cannot find a way to retrofit the lens onto a cheaper projector.  The first two projectors are great, but very expensive.
Yes, the PH315-51-78 is the "main" model number.  The "5" stands for 512GB of memory (otherwise, it carries 256GB of memory).  The letters after that stand for the types of wireless interfaces supported.  For example, the "A" stands for "All", which are a,b,g,n,ac.  The "NP" means only the ac internet is available.  Other than that, there is no difference between them.
If you are looking for price, an HP EliteBook 725 G3 would be your best bet, with   a 12.5" HD screen, and prices starting at $649 right now.   But, in fact, for only $899, you can get the Lenovo ThinkPad E485 with a 14" HD screen, and a Ryzen (yes!) processor. ($799 if you're willing to drop the SSD requirement.)  Notice that SSD size upgrades are very cheap for this model; I'd pay the $100 to upgrade to the 512GB SSD if I were buying this.  Of course, there are many more choices.  Many.
The Sony - DPT Series Digital Paper is in fact the first such product, developed precisely for the reason that many people were in your boat.  Going down your requirements:   easily put bookmarks on pages; (preferably multiple types of bookmarks)   Not sure   easily go to chapters based on contents section;   Yes   easily switch back and forth bookmarked pages, or between chapters; (preferably easily switch between pdfs)   Yes to between chapters; not sure for others   draw notes in existing pdf files with a pen.   Yes   easily go through such notes or bookmarks.   No   Easily transfer files to the tablet via wifi   Yes   Bonuses: taking notes in a note-taking app.   Yes   doesn't necessarily have to do anything else (e.g. no youtube, email, etc)   Its functionality other than what you can write on the screen is very limited.
DO NOT BUY Dasung.  I spent around $1000 on their Paperlike, and it crashes after about 20-30 seconds the first time, and after 2-3 frames subsequently.  I tried troubleshooting this with them, and they had me try different things, updated firmware, etc., until the 120-day deadline with PayPal passed (60+ days of this was purely shipping) -- and then, they're just ignoring my e-mails.  SONY DPT RP1 has a very limited functionality.  Only read existing PDF files, and write things on the screen.  No additional apps, no functionality as a monitor, anything.  However, if all you need it for is to read PDF's, then it is very fast and stable -- highly recommend.  Good e-reader 13.3" has Android, which means that you can run other apps also.  At the same time, it sorta implies that it will be slower at best, if not buggy.  Onyx Boox Max Carta has Android, and the additional option to create your own software for it, making it the most versatile of the four.  I haven't tried out Icarus A4, since it's still in the production stage.  There is still a possibility that it might turn out to have a story similar to Dasung.
The tablet I can propose is Microsoft Surface 4. Specially model with 8GB of RAM and i5 processor have no problem with latency and I use it extensively with Adobe Lightroom with pen. Also time to time I play with Windows 10 app for handwriting and see no lag of pen.
For monitors, you don't need to do this at all.   It's in the monitor spec.   Have you ever seen a monitor boast it has a 120hz  Refresh Rate?  In perhaps the simplest equivalency in computing, 1 Hertz = 1 Frame each second.     Frames are the still images displayed by the screen.  Just like movies, we still view our screens as a series of rapidly changing still images.   This is why when you experience "graphics lag", you get visual stuttering, as the computer hangs on a frame and fails to send updates to the monitor. Low refresh rates, common in older, CRT monitors and early LCDs, can cause headaches and eye discomfort.   High refresh rates allow for improved clarity, a more comfortable viewing experience, and more fluid motion.   Makers are required by law in many places to display this information on the packaging, due to the very health concerns you're experiencing.  They're more than happy to provide the information, as it's an accurate measure of image quality and they're eager to show off high rates that allow for 3D Stereoscopic viewing; however, if the monitor has aged, this can degrade the monitor quality with use.  It shouldn't be noticeable, but if you're like me and hang on to monitors until they go black and never turn on again, it might be something that has happened. For situations like that, you can use the computer itself to test the monitor (as it must internally just to sync its images) using tools provided by your graphic card manufacturer or websites like this one.  You can just look up the monitor model online for the base spec, and you can view the monitor properties in Device Manager or Display Properties on a Windows system to see its operational Refresh Rate.  By all means, give this a try and post your rates, it might be a good supplement to the question to know your results!
Since it sounds like you're just looking for a basic Linux box that has the RAM and processor for some work as a basic server and high-end workstation, is that correct?  Assuming so, pretty much anything from either major manufacturer (AMD, Intel) will do the job.  AMD tends to be a little cheaper on the processor for a little less performance (not like the old K6-2 days where they were always superior to Intel) and both companies make phenomenal multi-core processors.   The flagship of the Intel line is the i9 series, but I recommend anyone that isn't using the computer for enterprise-level stuff go with an i7 for the value - to - performance as you won't see much of a difference unless you really tax that thing.   I use an i7-8700k overclocked to 5.3 ghz and it's a good value for the processor.   AMD's ThreadRipper is an amazing home server core, but is really more in competition with Xeons than it is the i-series.   Both companies now have video processing on-die so no video card is necessary, especially if your motherboard has more than one VGA, DVI, Displayport, etc.   You can just plug one into each connection.   Motherboards are basically Manufacturer + features.   Reliability isn't much of a measure here until you dive into the "nobody" boards.  Just pick the Asus, Gigabyte, etc. board of your choice based on features.   Processor frequencies aren't moving much because of both heat and the lack of need over the last several years.  They consume less power now, but require cleaner power to perform well.  Your old PSU might work, but I wouldn't risk it, not when you can get a brand spanking new 650w EVGA Bronze PSU for about 60 bucks on sale.  it's also possible your old PSU doesn't have the second power connector for the motherboard, which won't stop the computer from working but it will make it less stable and prone to clocking itself down.   16GB of RAM is now the "High End Standard" for home users.   8GB is the standard for retail.   32GB is for gamers and enthusiasts and we don't even use that much, 64GB is for people with more money and need for bragging rights than sense, and anything above that is for server work and massive, multiple-application environments like running VMWare hosts.    If I were you, I'd scale down the requirements and spend more money on storage.  That's the new nightmare for computer users; local storage runs out really fast in the age of selfies and downloading everything and sharing memes and larger software.  Visual Studio on Windows 10 by itself takes up 20GB with some of the features installed.
If your load is 470W, then even at 110V (worst-case scenario), you are using 4.3A.  According to the AutoZone guide, even at the thinnest (18AWG) wire, you can run 13 Amps through it (which is >3 times what you are using), and having it heat only to 150Â°F.  Therefore, you can run the 18AWG wire without any problems.  In general, when asking this, you should include the length of the power cable, and the temperature you'll use it in -- as it makes a huge difference.  For example, I had a 24AWG cable that could handle ~150A at below freezing, which is ~35 times as much as your scenario -- precisely because it is only a couple inches long.  One time I used it at above a freezing temperature, and it melted the isolation off of it.
From WikiPedia,      Standalone cabinet PDUs are self-contained units that include main breakers, individual circuit breakers, and power monitoring panels. The cabinet provides internal bus bars for neutral and grounding. Prepunched top and bottom panels allow for safe cable entry.[6]   Example: APC 0G-PD40G6FK1-M.
A simple search for "stereo recorders" turned out plenty of results, such as Tascam DR-05.  It has two unidirectional audio microphones, pointed to the left and to the right, which makes it work really well.  Also, it supports (and includes) an SD card.
Since you modified your requirements, I am posting an answer, in case someone needs the first answer for the old requirements.  What you would need is, a recording mixer.  And unfortunately, those are simply not optimized for being cheap.  If you needed to replace your mixer, then it would not be a big price difference to simply buy one that does recording also.  However, you will be pleasantly surprised that I did find one professional audio recorder for less than $100.  Professional.  Sitting there in the middle of all the other products for $500, $300, $1000.  Technical Pro UREC7 is a rack-mountable device that can not only record audio on an SD or a USB professionally, but has all the adjustments for treble and bass, supports RCA inputs and outputs, etc.  Very fortunate to have found one so cheap.
Naztech makes a device they call the "Xtra Drive Mini" that is something like what I am after:    It's made of aluminum, takes a microSD card, and attaches to a keyring. It has shortcomings though:   Non-retractable (read: easily broken) proprietary Lighting connector with a removable (therefore loseable) cap. No keyring hole like the DataTraveler or Samsung above.
Here is one from Lenovo; it is also cheaper than the options you included.  If you are willing to drop the audio requirement, you can get it even cheaper (without VGA).  I hope Lenovo is a reliable enough manufacturer for you.
Personally, the people that I know of that engage in graphic design typically use and recommend drawing pen tablets like these rather than consumer touchscreens, particularly due to the fact touchscreens do not have good (if at all) pressure sensitivity. These drawing pen tablets do not seem to have any lag.  There are also specialized drawing tablets, on which you can draw directly on, however; they tend to be very pricey compared to cheaper "dumb" input pen tablets (like the wacom drawing tablet specified in the link above) that I see most beginners start with.  I am also not an artist and cannot speak to the durability or usability of these drawing pen tablets. As a result I am not comfortable directly recommending a specific tablet because I cannot speak to its efficacy. I hope this answer is ultimately able to help narrow down your hardware choices.

I think what you are looking for is called "USB Type-C splitter".  It seems that those things do exist, they are just not common yet and I'm not sure if you would be able to use both of the ports for data transmission, but at least you should be able to listen to music over type-c headphones and charge at the same time, as per the item description.  https://www.amazon.com/MChoice-Capsule-Modeling-Headphone-Splitter/dp/B07H151Y8X  https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/2-1-C-USB-3-1-AUX/32917688534.html
A development laptop definitely needs to have an SSD and a decent CPU, which is why I would suggest you to discard your list and take a look at 3 families of laptops: Asus VivoBook, Lenovo ThinkPad and Dell Inspiron.  There are many models that are cheaper than those that you listed and more suitable for development, like these:  ASUS VivoBook S510UN-EH76 - https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834234838  Lenovo Laptop ThinkPad E580 - https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834850555  Dell Inspiron 15 5000 - https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIADYY7BN9241  Now, why these laptops? All of the three models have what you will need for development - an i7-8550u CPU that is 22% faster than the last gen CPU's (i7-7500u) and also has 4 cores and 8 threads, compared to 2 cores and 4 threads of last gen mobile CPU's, which will speed up multithreaded applications and multitasking even more, and all of these models have a 256GB SSD that would be more than enough for most of development, as you would have even enough space to run a full android ROM build system that requires about 70 to 100 GB of disk space, if you wished.  My personal choice would be the ASUS VivoBook, as it has, besides i7-8550u CPU and 256 GB SSD, also a 1 TB HDD drive (which you could of course upgrade to a larger 2 TB HDD drive or to a second SATA SSD), a dedicated GPU (not very much useful for development, but you would be able to run more demanding graphical applications that on the Intel GPU) and two RAM slots, which should allow you to upgrade it to 32 GB of RAM in the future! And I'm also using ASUS laptop myself and I can say that I'm quite satisfied with it.    Now what I wouldn't recommend:  LG Laptops - last time I heard of them was that LG made cheapo laptops with low build quality and haven't really heard any recommendations about them, as opposed to Lenovo's, ASUS and Dell's of which I have heard good reviews.  Sony VAIO - maybe this was just my bad experience, but AVOID THOSE LAPTOPS. I once had a ~2000$ laptop from Sony and all I can say is that experience was ABSOLUTELY terrible - the manufacturer just ditched support right as those laptops left the factory, all of the drivers had terrible issues like memory leaks, BSODs, hanging the system and not working properly (like Wi-Fi limiting to 5kbps untill I installed separate drivers), the manufacturer didn't respond to any customers of a 2000$ laptop, the performance was subpar and it had even less driver support in UNIX system. I even had to reflash the BIOS after an unsuccessful Linux installation as the BIOS wouldn't respond to anything. Their business model was to sell you the laptop and then pay $$$ for support, as it had a "conveniently" preinstalled support app and even a physical "support" button that would try to redirect you to contact their service center. Again, this was my experience and that laptop is now 4 years old, so things might have changed, but you should still take it into consideration)
It seems more like a superuser stackexchange question, since Thunderbolt is a universal cable that can support different protocols, including Ethernet. All you would need to connect two Thunderbolt PC's directly is a good Thunderbolt cable.  For answer to your question you should take a look at those guides:  https://macperformanceguide.com/ThunderboltNetworking-SettingUp.html  https://www.qnap.com/en-us/how-to/tutorial/article/using-a-qnap-thunderbolt-nas-to-set-up-a-high-speed-file-sharing-system/  https://gtrusted.com/how-to-connect-a-mac-and-windows-pc-over-a-10gb-ethernet-network-and-transfer-files-using-thunderbolt-3
Daniel > I would go with AliExpress. Starts from 18 USD?
Are you looking for new or used?  The cheapest new x86 PC's you can get without monitor from somewhat known brands are:  UP Core - https://up-shop.org/up-core/271-up-core.html 1-4 GB RAM, 16-64 GB eMMC storage, Intel Atom X5 Z8350, 99$USD for cheapest options  ASUS Computer Stick VivoStick - https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883221244 2 GB RAM, 32 GB eMMC, Intel Atom X5 Z8350, 119$USD  Or you can shop for prebuilt Celeron systems on AliExpress, since there are plenty of options and you can also pick what hardware will be installed (RAM, SSD, CPU):  XCY Pocket Mini PC - https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/XCY-Intel-Celeron-1007U-10/32859512422.html 2 GB RAM, 16 GB SSD, Intel Celeron 1007U, 92$USD  Mini PC Celeron J1900 - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Mini-PC-Celeron-J1900-Quad-Core-Windows-10-Dual-LAN-2-COM-Fanless-Mini-Computer-Celeron/32839489621.html 2GB RAM, 30 GB SSD, Intel Celeron N2810, 104$USD  Other than those options some used laptop might have more power in sub-100 price range, but you would need to choose carefully.
5760x1200 is 6,912,000 pixels, which is 1 billion less pixels than true 4k resolution (3840Ã—2160, 8,294,400 pixels), so 4k framerates could be comparable to 5760x1200 framerates (but take it with a grain of salt, as for ultrawide resolutions like 5760x1200 the GPU would need more memory to load textures).  So it might be worth to get two GTX 1080 Ti and use them in SLI - according to benchmark they will outperform 2080 Ti for almost the same cost:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiK0bomLrvM  That is unless you want to throw money and get two 2080 Ti in SLI - nothing would beat it, but you would spend $1000 more for a marginal increase in performance (and a chance of getting a faulty GPU, since Nvidia's 20xx series were having a lot of troubles and bad chips).  You should also consider upgrading your RAM and SSD to max out your rig performance, to something like this Intel Optane in RAID 0 https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820167440 for storage and at least 32 GB of RAM either at 4133MHz and 17 CAS latency like this G.SKILL F4-4133C17Q-32GTZR https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820232677 or this 4700MHz Corsair CMW16GX4M2K4700C19 https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820236447 and also investing in custom professional liquid cooling for your rig, as this will allow you to OC your GPU's and CPU even more.
Oh, wow, you found the right person to ask.  Because I spend ~14 hours today, trying to get DisplayLink to work with 4 additional monitors over USB 2.0.  So I can tell you the experience firsthand.  The first thing I'll point out is, that DisplayLink is fairly slow at multiple monitors.  So my Ultra HD monitor loads much quicker over DisplayLink, than two 1024x768 monitors.  Over USB 2.0, the first .4 seconds of motion the response is good, after that there's about 0.15 second lag (e.g., if I'm dragging a window, I often overshoot).  It seems that the cache to update the image gets full.  Even if the other window is blank, and doesn't change at all.  The performance over USB 3.0 is better.  That being said, two things to keep in mind.  One, if all you're doing is writing code (or anything that doesn't erase a bunch of pixels at once), then you should be fine.  And two, the difference between 2 monitors and 4 monitors is negligible.  It seems the main cause of lag is for it to figure out which monitor to send it to, versus simply sending the image directly to the monitor.  Considering the uHD performed that much better, I think tomorrow I'll spend figuring out how to make Windows treat the multiple monitors that I have as a single monitor.  And now, the good side.  The best part of DisplayLink, is their support for old hardware.  I have a generic graphics card from 2003 or so, and DL now has a version that works with it.  I have tried several different companies online, until I saw someone sell a "will work guaranteed" adapter online for $500.  It turns out their have direct access to DL's developers (in UK, I believe) -- so they corresponded with them, DL sent some diagnostic software, and lo and behold -- in a few months they came out with a version that works for my graphics card.  Also, the reliability of DisplayLink is simply amazing.  I run DL software on 6 computers in my family, and there was one that would give black screens occasionally.  They sent one diagnostic software, which generated a report and I sent it back to them.  They sent another diagnostic tool, another report, and they told me I had to send them back the screen, which they programmed with another firmware, and mailed back to me.  Bottom line, DL is committed to reliability, and in a more complicated setup, I'd choose it over KVM any day.
It appears to me that SAF Tehnika J0SSAP60 is exactly what you are looking for - https://www.saftehnika.com/en/ebandspectrumcompact  It is a has a bandwidth of 56 to 67 GHz, but you would need to get a quote from the manufacturer to buy it.  SAF Tehnika J0SSAP60
There is a UGreen USB-C dock, but it doesn't have a headphone jack:  https://m.aliexpress.com/item/32821301992.html  I have used a few UGreen products, such as DP cables, USB switcher and USB network card and they seem quite reliable and AliExpress rating of this product is high.
The main difference between the LG and the Dell monitor is that the LG monitor has an "Ultra-Ultra-wide" aspect ratio, meaning that you will have a lot more horizontal real estate. I've heard of 21:9 aspect ratio monitors feeling like the real estate of two normal computer monitors which might be a plus or minus to you depending on your usage scenarios. The LG also has a higher refresh rate at 75 hz which technically makes it slightly better for gaming, though most people find 60 to be enough to suit their tastes.  Addressing your concern for price, I think that the Dell monitor is a bit over priced. I find that certain big name brands in particular tend to over price their products in comparison to others that have similar specs. I believe that this is the case here at a $400 list price, which is what 2K and 4k monitors can go for. In my experience, DELL products, in general, tend to be either hit or miss when it comes to good value.    Between your choices in a purely objective sense, the LG monitor will probably be of better value as it has a pixel density of 2.76 (+33% megapixels), has a slightly higher refresh rate (+25% Hz), and also supports AMD FreeSync (this is an anti screen tearing technology see link for more details, I believe you need an AMD GPU for this to apply).
Coming from someone with a lot of fans in his system ill share what my experience with them is. The amount of fans is not nearly as important as a good air flow. You need a good way for air to get into you case and (what most people forget) you need a way for air to be blown out of your case. It would be counterproductive to get the one but not the other and as you stated you only have a fan on your CPU and PS this is a bare minimal of fans. (Are you sure your case does not have any fans?).   My advice for you would be to see where the air goes now and how you want to get rid of said air. If your desktop is placed inside a desk, hugging the back wall or tucked in a corner be aware that that seriously limits the air flow out of your case. If I was in your situation I would place it in an air flow rich place and not on the floor (which attracts a lot of dust).     If you want to buy only a single fan  Place a fan in the front of your case (if your case allows that) blowing into your pc letting the hot air be taken from this flow to the back of the case.     If you want to buy two fans  Place a fan in the front of your case blowing inwards and place a fan at the back blowing outwards. This would allow cool air to be mixed with the hot air your PS and CPU fan are blowing into the case. The fan at the back would collect this mixed air and blow it out the back since the fan in the front causes the air to be blown to the back of your case. (Dont place it close to the back wall though!)    For brand recomendations, personally I really like the be quiet! series and the Silent wings 3 are also quite cheap ~20/25 euro's.   (Oh and also, cyber monday is comming up ;) )
Like so many answers this answer comes with limitations that may not suit you. Limitations:   Requires some minimal electronic skill Reading and assembly required   The Onion Omega2+ $13 (or Omega2 $10) with a PowerDock $6 and $3 USB audio adapter all under $30.  Download the Omega2 Project book Vol1 and find Chapter 5 (Audio projects)  Hope you are adventurous enough to take on this project you will find it very rewarding. Cheers, Doc
Asus RT-N66U Does have the same feature you are looking for. I hope it will give you the same feeling as if you are downloading/uploading and seeding on your pc/laptop and moreover, it gives you more control over network. following link contains more information about the router Asus RT-N66U
If you don't mind the pricing (there is an ongoing cost for the Merakis last time I checked, X per device per year and the devices are not exactly cheap either), then Meraki's are excellent.   I've used a single MX, 2 Meraki PoE switches and 3 of the APs to cover an office of the size you mentioned, and having everything in their management interface was very convenient (as was the ability to upload a floor plan and have actual positioning of APs reflected there). VPN concurrency was never and issue and we were throttled on the uplink rather than the capacity of the MX anyway. Otherwise the setup ran very reliably and managing updates and looking at logs/monitoring was a breeze.  This was all a few years ago, just prior to the Cisco acquisition, and I have moved to a company with a different provider (Aruba) now, but I ran the Merakis in 2 locations for almost 3 years without a hitch, I would recommend them in general (again, if you are OK with the cost).
NVMe PCI-Express: Samsung MZ-V7P512BW  Model: Samsung 970 Pro NVMe PCIe M.2 512GB    https://ssd.userbenchmark.com/SpeedTest/498971/Samsung-SSD-970-PRO-512GB      SATA: Samsung MZ-76P512B  Model: Samsung 860 Pro 512GB    https://ssd.userbenchmark.com/SpeedTest/431483/Samsung-SSD-860-PRO-512GB       Total price: Around 11000 CZK in an e-shop like https://www.czc.cz/, which is yet acceptable. Maybe before Christmas, there will be a sale.      Bottom Line: I think these are a lot overpriced, and I am unsure I would ever use their speed to maximum, but they are flagships, so I post them.
NVMe PCI-Express: Samsung MZ-V7E500BW  Model: Samsung 970 Evo NVMe PCIe M.2 500GB    https://ssd.userbenchmark.com/SpeedTest/493995/Samsung-SSD-970-EVO-500GB      SATA: Samsung MZ-76E500B/EU  Model: Samsung 860 Evo 500GB    https://ssd.userbenchmark.com/SpeedTest/428560/Samsung-SSD-860-EVO-500GB       Total price: Less than 6000 CZK in an e-shop like https://www.czc.cz/, which is totally acceptable. Maybe I could even go for higher capacity this way.      Bottom Line: I think these are priced well, I know they are a bit slower than Pro versions, but they are really tempting to buy.
You might find it on notebookcheck, but if you don't, simply look at similar laptops. The cooling system may change a bit the performance, but you can see that in reviews and then evaluate if your model might be slightly better/worse that the benchmark you found.
I thought about writing a comment first, but since it will be relevant to other people I will write it as an answer.  There are a few things you need to consider when doing this upgrade:   Do you really need NVMe SSD? NVMe speeds reach into thousands of MB/s, it sounds impressive, but in real computing, you would see a marginal difference, the real difference being in 2-8%, according to my estimates. Compiling AOSP on my SATA SSD loads my Ryzen 1700x CPU up to 90-95%, and your laptop has a much weaker 7700HQ. Most of the heavy computing you do will be CPU-bound, and upgrading SSD won't help it. You might see some apps taking a second or two less to load. The only real use for those speeds is actually doing backups. If you can't stand to let them run overnight, then having SSD's is a plus. But with NVMe SSD's you still would be IO bound - to run a backup at SATA III speed you would need at least a 5 gigabit speed, while your laptop only has a gigabit Ethernet adapter, that is just as fast as a decent HDD. Even a 10 gigabit would max out at ~1200 MB/s, which your Toshiba KXG50ZNV512G is capable of delivering. To get even higher speeds you would need a Thunderbolt port. You would also need a storage that supports those kinds of speed, so either a RAID 0 NAS or another NVMe SSD. Samsung's 860 aren't quite as good as you think. Its speed is a bit of a cheat - it uses a cheap flash and a fast caching storage, so after the cache gets filled its speed drops to 120-150 MB/s. If you were to use it intensively you would notice a performance drop.   So, my suggestion is:  Go for a single 1TB Samsung 970 Pro M.2:  It costs about 11400 CZK on the website you suggested, it delivers one of the best SSD performance, and it is the most cost-efficient solution. SSD prices drop and storage increases, buying a 500 GB SSD now would require a sooner upgrade and make it less reusable in future. You would also be able to install your VM's on it, and in this case, it might actually improve VM's performance.    https://ssd.userbenchmark.com/SpeedTest/497261/Samsung-SSD-970-PRO-1TB  And an M.2 to SATA adapter. You already have a working SSD, so why not reuse it?
Lots of question, lots of answers.     I don't understand the differences between different mother boards' chipsets.   The difference is pretty well explained on the Wikipedia page of AM4 socket. Mostly SLI / CFX support and number of ports / slots.     I also don't understand how to quantify the difference between motherboards with the same chipsets. How do you measure these differences? Which features matter and why (I am not doing SLI)?   Motherboards can include a whole lot of features, like dual bios (two BIOS chips onboard), more slots, better design, software features (OC suites, etc). The quality of components can also vary. The question is: what are you going to need ? And if you don't know, which is probably the case, ask yourself what you're gonna do with the mobo (OC, multi GPU, etc), you'll have the answer.     How do I measure latency? How much does it affect performance? I don't understand if 3200hz matters.   I'll advice watching LTT video on ram speed.     Also, there are a lot of different kinds with 3200Mhz, what are the differences and how do you know? Some brands like and models like FLare X say they are for AMD. What the hell does that mean? How do you make sense of it? Is other memory specifically for Intel?   The chips on the sticks can be different. Please notice that Ryzen are quite more tricky on frequency than Intel CPUs, it's harder to achieve high frequency, or to the cost of a higher latency. That's why there are "Ryzen optimized" rams. This does NOT mean that other rams won't work with Ryzen, it means that other rams COULD possibly not run at their maximum speed / minimum latency on Ryzen.  When I said different chips, I meant different ranges, from different manufacturers. That can be a way of choosing your ram, especially for Ryzen. You can rely on this table for chips ranges. This is an extract of what is written above the table:     In general (on Ryzen) you can expect up to 3466 MHz (without BCLK-OC) with Samsung B-Die (on AGESA 1.0.0.6+ Bios Versions), up to 2933 MHz (without BCLK-OC) with Samsung D/E/S-Die (AGESA 1.0.0.5+). Hynix A/M-Die are mostly working @ 3200 MHz with AGESA 1.0.0.5+. Do note that Dual Rank RAM is faster than Single Rank. E.g. 2933 MHz Dual Rank is faster than 3200 MHz Single Rank.   It was written for 1st gen Ryzen, but is still quite accurate today.     I don't understand what 'SSR' and 'PX' mean? I also don't understand if I should care. How do you tell the difference between these things?   I would say SSR and PX have to do with the platform used, but I wouldn't put money on it. What you should care about is the range, a Focus Plus (e.g. SSR 550 FX) isn't the same range as Prime Platinium Ultra (e.g. SSR 550 PD2) and the quality is not the same. Once again, how much you should care depends on what you want / need. Of course, if you have a low budget, you're not going to head toward the highest end 1KW PSUs.  I would recommend to consider SuperFlower and FSP as well, they're part of the biggest PSU manufacturers with Sea. Evga is also very good, using SP, FSP and Sea parts. If you don't know if your PSU is good, look at that table. It'll probably give you reviews for the model you're looking for, once you found it.
After I asked some repair shops, the right size for the N5110 is 12.7mm, but you can still use the 9mm too
The cheapest x86 solution is probably going to be based on an RDC chip.  See http://www.rdc.com.tw/.  The OpenWrt project carried some information on devices that contained these chips:  https://openwrt.org/docs/techref/targets/rdc, however it seems lately many designs have been replaced by ARM-based solutions.  Here is one x86-based device still for sale that could be hacked:   http://www.frineta.lt/eshop/product.php?id_product=239&id_lang=1  That said, RDC have come up with newer chips that must have found their way into newer SBCs, e.g. EmKore (http://www.rdc.com.tw/?route=home/emk).  I presume someone is making SBCs based on those.
There isn't a device which allows a 3.5" floppy drive to read off of Flash memory, simply because the drive itself works through the traditional mechanical means of its media.   Such a device would be similar to a car tape-deck adapter for a CD player, and would be prone to failure anyway.   There are many, many devices like this one which will allow you to use USB disks with a 3.5" bay, however.   They require connection to the USB headers on your motherboard or an expansion card purchased separately.
Even if it's a Windows keyboard, should also work on a Mac.   It's painful to use a windows keyboard on mac for writing. But I can really really recommend you the older 2nd Generation Apple Wireless Keyboard (A1314).  It does not have mechanical switches but to be honest, it's my daily keyboard for more than 5 years now and it works just perfectly. I have a mechanical keyboard at home and have to say the feeling on the older Apple Wireless Keyboard is just perfect.  You can get the keyboard on eBay new or rare used for 50-70 USD.  IMHO it has some advantages to the newer one:   AA batteries (you can just buy a pack of 4 rechargeable eneloops (or something similar) and they last at least 2 months (9 hours of daily usage) â€“ switching the batteries is done within seconds. The keycaps can be replaced on your own in case something will be damaged Heavier Higher keycaps   All of those advantages can be seen as disadvantages, but this is just my opinion.
SATA 1  150mb/s SATA 2  300mb/s SATA 3  600mb/s   If the RAID controller has SATA 3 connectors it should be able to handle it.  If you are looking for raw speed a samsung ssd will do 500-550mb/s read and 300+mb/s write beating any 2 hard drives you can attach via SATA.
Your big problem is that you want it to have normal computer connections on the case, honestly.    "Slim and Light" is the main thing people look for when scoping out their laptop's casing, so even some ASUS Republic of Gamers laptops still only have two USB ports and very little else for connectivity.   I would recommend looking into a Sager. They specialize in customized gaming laptops, and most of the cases they use still appear to have the connections you requested.  Your size requirement is in your way on the RAM; 13" and smaller machines have a lot of tech packed in a small space, and actual physical size of the motherboard is influencing the number of RAM slots you have available or even necessitating permanent integration.  The problem isn't the CPU having a limitation, but the motherboard's physical capacity.
After hours of searching online I found a device I'm going to give a shot. Withings Pulse HR seems to match the functionality expectations. Feels a bit pricy for the quality (based on the reviews), however.
Intel U means low power, it has often lower core count (older i7 had 4c/8t whereas i7U had 2c/4t) and lower TDP (partly achieved by lower frequency too).  Recent Intel laptop CPUs are based on FCBGA sockets, which mean soldered to the motherboard, whether it is an HQ or a U (which you can find at the bottom of the Intel spec sheet).
Alright, there we go. Phones now have quite big storage capabilities, going up to hundreds of GBs, and even more with ÂµSD cards. They are also more and more powerful, so a recent phone (like your Moto G6) should be totaly capable of going through your library.  Just for curiosity, how much time does it take to launch shuffle mode with 150K songs ?
As a user of Asus ZenBook Flip S I can advocate for it, as it has all of the features you are asking for and is also quite convenient to use even on public transport. It's heat is barely noticeable as it has a 15W i7-8550u CPU, which, by the way, is about 88% faster than second generation i5. The keyboard is quite nice, as for me and the battery can last for 6 hours of moderate use. It works fine with Linux, but last I checked it lacked driver support for it's fingerprint reader in Ubuntu, although it might be available in newer packages.  https://www.asus.com/2-in-1-PCs/ASUS-ZenBook-Flip-S-UX370UA/    Other than that, I have heard good reviews about other Asus ZenBooks.   But keep in mind that laptops with even lower TDP Celeron CPU's exist, like Chuwi Lapbook SE with a 6W Celeron N4100, but it's performance might be even worse than that of your laptop, thus I personally wouldn't recommend them.
When the RAM is not getting refreshed it will decay and leave a pattern which is unique to the RAM in your cellphone.   I don't like giving these kinds of answers, but your statement here is incorrect. There is no physical process like you describe that happens with RAM memory chips. You can induce data decay under the right conditions but that doesn't degrade the physical structure of the chip itself. If you compromise the structure of the memory chip you can expect it to stop working pretty much instantly. Furthermore, when RAM modules are sitting on store shelves or in shipping crates or on industrial storage racks at the factory, they are getting no power or data fed to them. They are not "getting refreshed" in any capacity, yet they do not decay in the way that you describe. In fact, they don't decay at all. This is as true of RAM chips designed for cell phones as it is true of RAM chips designed for any other purpose.  Regarding physical unclonable functions (PUF's) in general:  PUF's are usually introduced during fabrication, and I don't think it's possible to use that randomized process on RAM chips without demolishing the integrity of the chip. Most implementations are for things like RFID security chips and they have a dedicated section of the chip for that process. They don't just go and introduce random imperfections in parts of the silicon that are supposed to function. It's certainly not something you could attempt in the aftermath without intimate knowledge of the fabrication process and layout, which isn't information that is publicly available even in manufacturer documentation.  TLDR What you are trying to do is quite literally impossible, at least through the methodology that you describe.
There are microcomputers I suggested in another similar question, and unless your cam needs a specific connector you can choose from those:  UP Core - https://up-shop.org/up-core/271-up-core.html  1-4 GB RAM, 16-64 GB eMMC storage, Intel Atom X5 Z8350, 99$USD for cheapest options  ASUS Computer Stick VivoStick - https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883221244  2 GB RAM, 32 GB eMMC, Intel Atom X5 Z8350, 119$USD
Would 310MHz be acceptable? If so, the well-developed X10 system may be useful. An introduction is available. Lamp socket modules are available.
You are greatly overestimating the power dissipation of modern PC's and underestimating the heating power required. Even the most powerful modern builds with dual CPU and 4 GPU's would generate about 1kW of heat. To heat even a small house you would need at least 10kW, so you would be looking at running at least 10 of those PC's. My Ryzen 1700x build pulls about 150W from the mains when I run compilers at 100% CPU usage.  Which gives me an idea, if you are mostly interested in heating your house than doing useful computation - get some very cheap used motherboards, CPU's and GPU's from old generations, like second generation Intel 2xxx, Nvidia 5xx, 6xx, even something like 9800 which you can get for ~20 USD and just run a cryptocurrency farm on them.
I would recommend setting up a small headless workstation, which can be even as small as an HTPC but house Ryzen 2700x on a mini-ITX motherboard and using a laptop to connect to it either using Remote Desktop or ssh, since I have a similar setup and it is quite convenient to use.  For example you can build workstation with following components:  ASUS ROG STRIX B450-I GAMING AM4 AMD B450 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.1 HDMI Mini ITX AMD Motherboard:  https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813119143  CORSAIR Vengeance LPX 32GB (2 x 16GB) 288-Pin DDR4 SDRAM DDR4 3200 (PC4 25600) Desktop Memory Model CMK32GX4M2L3200C16:  https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820236315  SAMSUNG 960 EVO M.2 1TB NVMe PCI-Express 3.0 x4 Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) MZ-V6E1T0BW:  https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA12K54C9643  SILVERSTONE SFX Series SST-ST30SF-V2 300W SFX 80 PLUS BRONZE Certified Active PFC Power Supply:  https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817256175  MITXPC MX500 Industrial Fanless Mini-ITX Case w/ WallMount Bracket & VESA Screws:  https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAB944MW9009    And you can use a laptop of your choice, like Asus ZenBook or Lenovo Thinkpad.
Yes, it does work together.  Yes, this motherboard will run both ECC and non ECC ram (always in non ECC mode though) according to AnandTech.     Will the opposite case work?   Depends. ECC unbuffered memory should work on non ECC memory, from LinusTechTips.
On a laptop, I would recommend an i7 8th gen for your use case. These CPUs are 4 cores for the U (low power), and 6 cores for the H (high performance) series. They have decent single thread performance (only desktop CPUs would have better single thread performance), and have enough cores such that they work very well for multi threaded workloads as well.  I would recommend the ThinkPad T and P series, to be specific the T480/T480s or the P52/P52s. Generally for most development, a T480 or T480s would suffice (note: the "s" variant is thinner and lighter, but sacrifices the removable battery). But if you want the fastest performance, go for the P52. Make sure you use an SSD and not a hard drive because that will make a lot of difference in the performance of the machine.
The PiJuice HAT includes a battery solution for the Pi, and has a built-in RTC. There's additional features/add-ons available as well.
Your motherboard does support ECC memory, but probably not registered. If you absolutly want ECC memory, try to find ECC Unbuffered memory, like Crucial CT16G4WFD824A for example.  FIY, another related question that was asked yesterday, Will a non-ECC memory work with motherboard and CPU that supports ECC?
File explorer, PDF reader, etc, are not issues for nowadays tablets, every single one can do it.  Now if you're looking for a tablet around 10" with a good battery life, Huawei Mediapad M5 Lite could be great. I bet it is even totally overkill for just displaying some PDF files.  A ~120-140 USD tablet would still be more than enough, like a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 2016 or a Lenovo Tab 4 10.1.  Then install a decent file explorer like ES Explorer or whatever you want, and a PDF reader if it does not have one already, and that's done.
As you mention that memory is a bottleneck in your computations I would imagine that the rock64 is the best solution with 4gb of memory. If you want to make a cluster of these you will have to do some work creating a frame, compact power supply and integrate a network switch.  If you want a small high performance server with a lot of memory to do computations on I'd go with a single intel NUC.  But if you are looking for a cheap and simple way to get into cluster computing and experimentation I'd advice looking into a raspberry pi combined with the cluster hat.  This set up would consist of the following:   1 x Raspberry pi 3 B+ (4C 1.4GHz, 1GB RAM) 4 x Raspberry Pi zero (1C 1GHz, 512MB RAM)  1 x Cluster hat 5 x MicroSD card, as big as needed for each pi (8GB is more than enough for basic running) Optionally, Cluster hat case   I have no experience with this set up yet but am planning to buy it at the end of this month so I have done my research.  The good bits:   Runs on a number of operating systems (raspbian linux is most common) and has a large community. It's a palm sized 5 node cluster. Everything powers from a single 2.5A USB power supply. USB based networking and addressing integrated. The Raspberry Pi 3 b+ has wireless connectivity build in (connect to your existing network or set up as access point for your cluster) possibility to upgrade to pi zero W's to add wireless networking between nodes or to other networks. No need to worry about cooling too much. Bluetooth. (Everything's better with Bluetooth)   The down sides:   The perfomance of the 4 pi zero's combined is half of a regular raspberry pi 3b+ but bear in mind that this is an experimentation/learning setup. Limited memory (3GB total) Limited cpu cores (8 Total)
Just buy the MX Ergo.  Unfortunately, trackballs are a fairly narrow market with not a ton of demand; unsurprisingly, this means that prices aren't exactly the most competitive. Finding something cheaper than the $50 Nakabayashi mouse with Bluetooth unfortunately is a rather tall order, and unfortunately, hackey solutions like converting a wired mouse to wireless or converting proprietary wireless signals just aren't practicalâ€”both in terms of price and the end product.  The Ergo may not be the cheapest mouse, but you're getting a solid mouse for that money. My (albeit limited) experience with their gaming and MX Master mice has been extremely favorableâ€”something that's reflected in numerous reviews. Given how much time you're likely to spend with a mouse, IMO, it's worth getting something good.  If you're still uncomfortable with the price, you can monitor for sales or consider buying used, both of which should net you some savings.
After looking through the list of all cameras out there, it turns out the only cameras with a screen larger than 3" generally fall into the following categories:   Professional (read: expensive) cameras, e.g. Zeiss ZX1. Specialized cameras, e.g. Fluke TiX-640. Cameras with apps, e.g. Samsung Galaxy Camera.   However, there is a way to attach a larger, external monitor to a DSLR camera, with sizes 5.5" and higher.  That would probably be the cheapest solution in this case.  However, in case the screen doesn't have to be 5.5", there is a way to get this even cheaper.  There is an abundance of blackberry phones with only basic apps, but with a screen larger than 3".
So essentially, what you would want is an Arduino pro micro with a usb adapter. Seytonic on YouTube did a whole series about a DIY rubber ducky using an Arduino. you can find his first video on the subject here but once you have seen said video I recommend watching the updated video on the subject which you can find here. He also goes deeper by adding on different functions to the Arduino like SD card storage or switches to change between scripts.  While this is one of the cheaper solutions it also means that you have to do more work to get it up and running. If you are not versed in the arts of Arduino programming, or do not feel like putting in much effort I recommend you go check out Maltronics and go to the MalDuino section. The site is hosted by Seytonic himself and all of the products are hand soldered by him. I believe this is the best option for your needs considering that you do not have an extremely low budget. The cheapest option the MalDuino lite costs about 16 USD, and to convert between ducky script and Arduino you can check out Seytonics DuckyScriptConverter.  One other thing you can do, although I advocate against it, is to go out and buy a bunch of DigiSparks for one dollar each. This is probably a bad idea unless you have hours to spend fiddling with them like me, also most of the ones that you will get will come in broken which is why I recommend you buy a considerably large amount. But like I said, unless you have time to spare, I suggest you stay away from this option.
Personally I would not throw away that 126 GB PCI-e SSD as you've already paid good money for that drive. Based on your spec sheet, you have one more SATA III slot that can accept a 2.5" Drive. Unless your PCIe drive is giving you problems from a speed perspective it is not worth replacing that drive. You likely won't see that much of a speed difference in visual studio build speed unless you're like me and have allocated a part of your RAM for application development (I build applications on a RAM disk for speed and even with non PCI-e drives it can build GB sized applications almost instantaneously).  That being said, you should keep your Visual Studio related program files to your primary SSD and send all your other junk to a slightly slower SATA SSD or HDD. This is going to be a lot more economical especially with the budget you specified.  I've recommended you Drives that can ship to a Malaysian address today.    SAMSUNG 860 EVO 500 GB RM 455 + RM 5 Shipping  It turns out this SSD option is exactly your budget. Owning a 840 EVO I can tell you these SSDs are excellent and come at a very reasonable price. Also here is a Amazon link in case you find Amazon can offer a better price for your location. I'm not familiar with the South-Eastern Asian Markets so it's hard for me to cull prices specific to Malaysia.   477 MB/s Read 423 MB/s Write     Seagate Barracuda 500GB (ST500LM030) RM 158 + RM 5 Shipping  In addition, I'll recommend a HDD, as you may not need that much speed for your additional files. HDD are very much under budget and I've taken care to recommend you one of the highest benchmarking HDDs at its price point. Here's the Amazon link for this as well.   Data Transfer Rate: Up to 140 MB/s     Finally if you really want, you can completely replace your PCI-e SSD with another one. I would recommend the Samsung 960 Evo, but only the 250 GB variant is under budget. Samsung also comes with cloning software so you can make a completely copy of your system onto any Samsung SSD and just plug it in and operate like normal. I've used Samsung's cloning software and can tell you its pretty painless.
I use this one (it used to be available on amazon) for my phone to charge it while attaching other usb-c devices (the ports on top can be used to plug in other devices, while the port on the side is used to provide power for the host device). I'm still looking for a smaller usb-c hub that only features two female usb-c ports, but I don't think it exists yet.
I'll summarize the comments in this answer, since comments can be removed anytime on Stack Exchange:   jcaron: remove the computer monitor stand. Mike Harris: one could use coworking spaces. David Richerby, user71659, Rory Alsop, Michael Hampton: there is currently no solution aside from buying/renting on site. JonathanReez: buy a pair of used monitors on site.
There is the x86 ODROID-H2 SBC which comes with 2 x 1 GBit ethernet, 2 x SATA, 2 x USB 3.0 (4 USB ports in total), 1 x M.2 NVMe and more.  As of 2018-12, it's sold for $ 111.  It's based on the Intel Celeron J4105 platform (CPU is soldered) and has 2 empty DDR4 SO-DIMM slots.  When using the SATA ports you need special SATA power cables.
There is no reason you could not have a standard IBM-PC format motherboard using an ARM CPU. Simply obeying the form factor (which nowadays includes not only mounting holes, but a set of backside connectors for video, USB, Net, etc.) as well as being PCI compliant would do it. Clearly the drivers and the software would be custom, but a Linux distro could do that easily, and Windows will soon run on ARM as well.
The vast majority of modern tower cases (and many smaller cases) support at least a 240mm radiator with fans in some configuration. AFAIK, there is no standardized compatibility keyword; however, most manufacturers make it clear in their documentation what radiators are supported (both footprint and thickness.)  One useful tool is PCPartPicker. To check compatibility, you can start a new system build, add a radiator, then go to cases and with "Enable compatibility filter" checked, browse the list of cases.     If you have other constraints in mind, please post them so we can help get you a more specific recommendation.
As mentioned in the comments its niche product. Even I've been looking for laptop with small spacebar  The best I could find is japanese laptops (with JIS layout) which have small spacebar (language can be changed to English and keyboard Type to ANSI)  you could have a look at JIS keyboard @ https://www.apple.com/jp/macbook-air/  Use Karabiner-Elements https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements on macOS to map extra keys according to your convenience
I would suggest using something like this. These are folding / sliding screens from behind your monitor. Great for when you want to carry your laptop, but you should be able to do some serious work.  https://www.yourslide.com/ (Kickstarter)  https://www.razer.com/eu-en/project-valerie (Razer's implementation)
So far it seems that https://usb.userbenchmark.com/ is the only place that allows me to sort the tested USB drives by the 4k write speed.  Based on the current stats, I'll check the local shops for:   Mushkin Ventura Ultra USB 3.0 Corsair Flash Voyager GTX USB 3.0 SanDisk Extreme Pro USB 3.1
Samsung Portable SSD T5 might be a good choice too, if you can find an offer that fits your budget: https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/portable/t5/
A GTX 1080/1080 Ti in a AORUS/Gigabyte Gaming Box/Sapphire GearBox/AKiTiO Node, on macOS High Sierra  Preface  First and foremost: what card is best for you will depend heavily on your specific workload, down to often even relatively small details. Things from what you're modeling, render settings, and even what format you're exporting to can influence what card works best for you massively. Unfortunately, spending more doesn't mean you'll be getting better performance, and outside of the very best Quadros, doesn't even guarantee the same level of performance. What I'm trying to do here is provide you with a general recommendation of what will probably be good given your (somewhat varied) workload. If it turns out that you're really doing one thing in particular, either come back here for more specific recommendations or contact the developer/a third party consultant who specializes in the tech for a specific recommendation.  Second: I am by no means an expert when it comes to hardware-accelerated GPGPU. The world of GPUs, even compared to others in the industry, is a particularly messy one, and I make no pretense that I understand it all or even close to it. If you want a brief and very interesting (while slightly terrifying) look into the world of graphics, I highly recommend this post on the Dolphin Emulator blog on ubershaders.  That said, let's get into it.  Graphics APIs  Understanding what GPU is best for you requires understanding how GPUs interface with software. Based on your background, I'll assume you understand the basic premise between APIs, but it's worth reviewing them in specific for macOS, since it in particular sits in a bit of a weird space when it comes to graphics APIs. For the purposes of these programs, macOS has three different graphics APIs: OpenCL, CUDA, and Metal. OpenCL is cross-vendor and cross-platform, working on AMD, Nvidia, and Intel (plus others) GPUs with Apple's out-of-the-box drivers on macOS. CUDA is specific to Nvidia GPUs but cross-platform, installable with Nvidia's web drivers on macOS. Metal is the newest of the bunch, written by Apple for their OSs with support for AMD, Nvidia, and Intel (plus others) GPUs. So, which to choose? Well, it's not so simple. Metal and CUDA tend to provide "better" access to the hardware, at the cost of the developers. Although Metal might seem like the obvious first choice, because it's so new and specific to Apple's OSs, performance is often somewhat lackluster, if developer support exists at all. OpenCL might seem like a solid bet, but because Apple wants to push Metal, it refuses to provide drivers past version 1.2, even outright deprecating it with the release of macOS 10.14 Mojave (somewhat ironic given Apple is the original author of OpenCL.) Additionally, Nvidia GPUs tend to perform worse with OpenCL compared to CUDA. CUDA, meanwhile, suffers from the obvious burden of only supporting Nvidia GPUs and lackluster support from Nvidia themselves.  This has left software vendors in a bit of a tight spot. Many have existing support for OpenCL (and sometimes CUDA) based hardware acceleration, but don't see a clear path forward. No matter what option they choose, they're either alienating part of their consumer base on the basis of their hardware choices, getting less performance than they could, or spending more time and resources developing their software. As a result, developers have basically scattered when it comes to what graphics API they use on macOS.  For this reason, this will be considered on a program by program basis, along with hardware.   After Effects (and sort of the rest of CC)  In the timeline, After Effects supports some effects and fast rendering on GPU using OpenGL for most, and CUDA only for a few.  As it stands, Media Encoder still favors OpenCL over Metal for encoding. Or maybe not? Initial testing with Adobe Media Encoder 2019 (which has a bunch of improvements on the Metal front) actually yielded a 11% (1:20 vs. 1:30) improvement with Metal transcoding from a H.264 screen recording to H.264 Youtube 1080p... so maybe not? In any case, I won't be considering this for now because of the wonky state of Metal at the moment (more on this later.)  Let's get down to the benchmarks:    Conclusion? More raw power is better (but not by a ton); Nvidia is favored somewhat over AMD; "Pro" features don't matter.  Maya  Viewport  Unfortunately, numbers for the RTX series aren't available here. However, we can still get a pretty good idea of things.   Rendering  AFAIK, Maya doesn't support GPU-based rendering. While I believe there are other renderers which do, I don't feel I'm qualified to talk about them here.   Conclusion? More raw power is better; AMD and Nvidia appear roughly equal; "Pro" features are favored by ~5-20%, but which features are important is unclear.  Cinema 4D  Viewport  Unfortunately, SPECviewperf numbers aren't available for Cinema 4D AFAIK, and I haven't been able to find a good replacement. Will update if I find something.  Rendering  Cinema 4D is really simple: no support for GPU rendering!  ...until it's not. While the "normal" rendering engine doesn't support GPU acceleration, Cinema 4D offers the ability to use a variety of other rendering engines, including Arnold, Octane, Redshift, and even Blender's Cycles engine. However, these might as well be considered separate programs, so I won't actually be covering those here.  Except, starting with release 20 on September 1st, 2018, Cinema 4D includes built-in support for the Radeon ProRender rendering engine, with support for OpenCL and Metal based acceleration. Unfortunately, because it's new, numbers are hard to come by. So far, all I've managed to find is this set:    Note also that these numbers are with OpenCL on Windows 10 Pro and don't include the RTX series.  Conclusion? More raw power is better; AMD is favored over Nvidia; "Pro" features don't matter. However, things are fast-moving.  GPU: The final decision  Based on your budget, ~$500 seems reasonable for your graphics card.   Frankly, the extra expense of a "pro" card doesn't make sense for the relatively minimal gains in Maya. Because of the much better availability of consumer cards, I'd highly recommend one of them over a pro card.  Going for straight power, a used GTX 1080 should be well within reach; and, if you're willing to shop around a bit, a GTX 1080 Ti should be doable. Right now, AMD's offerings just aren't competitive at this price point; used 10 series cards are far cheaper and available compared to Vega cards, and no AMD card can match the 1080 Ti ATM.  However, it must be noted that Nvidia cards are currently unsupported on Mojave, and other than Kepler, Metal drivers are absent, making it impossible to upgrade to Mojave. However, it seems likely that Nvidia will release drivers (with Metal support) in the future. Just when exactly that future is is unclear. In the meantime, stay on High Sierra.  Note also that Thunderbolt 2 and Nvidia eGPUs are unsupported by Apple and require extra work for macOS compared to the plug-and-play of an AMD card on Mojave with a TB3 equipped Mac. Since you've got a Thunderbolt 2 equipped laptop anyways, I'm going to recommend this setup anyways. Just keep this in mind.  eGPU enclosures  eGPU.io is a fantastic resource for everything eGPU related, from hardware recommendations to build guides. Information is generally quite recent, and the forums there are extremely useful.  I'm going to recommend using a Thunderbolt 3 eGPU enclosure with an adapter, rather than a Thunderbolt 2 enclosure. While Thunderbolt 2 enclosures can be cheaper, they're usually harder to find, have much, much lower power limits, and aren't great for upgradability.   eGPUs are a bit strange in that there are a bunch of different enclosures available, all of which are fairly valid choices. While I'm going to make some recommendations, if you find yourself looking at something else, there's nothing wrong with that. Again, the eGPU.io buyer's guide is a fantastic resource.  AORUS/Gigabyte Gaming Box with a preinstalled GTX 1080 â€“ ~$650?  This box is a pretty good deal at $670... if you can find one. Unfortunately, as far as I can find, they're completely out of stock in normal retail channels. However, they're still in good supply from 3rd party resellers for around $600 with the card, and often significantly less without the card.  Sapphire GearBox vs. AKiTiO Node â€“ $259  They're both very similar budget enclosures, each with a few trade-offs. Winner of each category gets asterixes:                      | GearBox                   | Node â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“+â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“+â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“ PSU type-location   | fATX-int                  | *SFX-int* Power delivery (PD) | *60W*                     | 15W IO                  | *2x USB 3.0, 1x Ethernet* | None   Frankly, most of these features are probably unimportant given your laptop and the already beefy PSUs included out of the box. So, it's really a toss-up IMO.  Razer Core X - $300  It's bigger, has a full sized PSU, and looks prettier. It also costs more. IMO, nothing more than a runner-up if you think the others are too ugly.
Get a used GTX 1080 Ti  Used 1080 Tis are easily available at ~$600 and frequently $400-$500 for local listings, where even the cheapest RTX 2080 will run you $700. Given that the two trade blows in benchmarks, that extra couple hundred is going exclusively towards a promise of raytracingâ€”at least as far as gaming is concernedâ€”and slightly better power consumption, with the slight benefit of getting a new card. These, IMO, are extremely weak benefits.  Regarding the rest of your setup, at least for gaming, nothing should bottleneck the GPU (except in a few select CPU-heavy titles such as CS:GO and sims.) More and faster storage is always a nice creature comfort though; given your motherboard has support for M.2 SSDs, you could get a new boot SSD, or even just a small SSD (maybe one with 3D XPoint?) to use as a cache for your HDD.
It's funny how you tagged your question "smartphones", asking for this functionality.  Practically all non-smartphones will be truly off when you turn off their power.  So get a flip phone; or, if you need more functionality, there's plenty more advanced non-smartphones, such as Samsung Star 2, or a variety of Blackberries.
Since it is a rare medical condition, I'm not aware of any such market device existing.  You can ask your doctor, who should be familiar with more people in your situation, and might be able to suggest something.  Or, you can make a DIY solution.  Get a strap, such as a guitar strap.  To this strap, attach a surface shaped to your body; a piece of sheet aluminum would be rigid enough and light enough for the job; you might have to cut it yourself with metal scissors.  Make sure to pad the side that touches your body.  Finally, on top of it, you can put a split keyboard.  If you cut your surface right, it would also have a spot for the tablet.  This should do the job.
Look on NewEgg.com: they allow customizing precisely such quantities, when filtering the laptops to display.  The exact search is here, and as you can see you can currently get this configuration for under $500.
I believe a standard USB-C splitter would do the job, no?
There is no really alternative to GPD Win currently as a handheld Steam-available gaming device (except... GPD Win 2 probably). I ended up getting the GPD Win ; I played a bit more on it recently (after having applied the recommended tweaks) and like it a lot.
The closest you will get to 'flawless' is a matched set of 4 sticks that are specifically recorded as compatible by the mobo manufacturer.   This is not an option for you, if you want to re-use your existing RAM. You could instead buy a matched pair of sticks of the same model as you currently have. While not a fully matched set, you should not have any problems.  You are not going to be able to buy a pair of Crucial sticks that are perfectly compatible with your existing Corsair one. However, if you buy a pair that are both supported by the mobo and have the same timings (e.g. 9-9-9-24) as the Corsair ones, you almost certainly won't have a problem. Usually the RAM timings are included in the RAM specs in the online stores.  And even if you put RAM with the same speeds but different timings, most modern motherboards can be configured to work in some sort of Auto mode that will find the best fit for your installed RAM. And almost certainly you will not notice any difference in real-world performance or reliability.  Summary: If it were me, I'd buy 2 more of the Corsair sticks or would get 2 x near identical Crucial sticks and would expect them to work without any problems, but if you want a placebo level of reassurance, buy a matched set of 4 sticks.  Note: it is a good idea when you get new RAM is to run MemTest86 overnight to tease out any potential problems - if you RAM passes such a test, you know you are in good order.

I have seen this a few times. E.g. this, where you use a treadmill with a standing desk. Or this.
The more powerfull (TDP (thermal dissipation power) in watt) the computer, the more you need to cool it down. You can combine one or several of these:   You can pick low energy components (CPUs). You can further underclock the CPU or undervolt it so it consumes less energy, hence heats less. Usually when the technology makes a new step (transistor size reduction, manufacturing optimization), the efficiency increases. You increase the radiator surface and lower the fans speed. For instance, your can take a big CPU cooler such as the Dark Rock pro 4, or use multiple watercooling radiators (which can be large: 360 , 480, and thick: 6cm for the EKWB XE). In the case of water cooling, pick an efficient radiator and designed for low speed air flow. Hardwarelabs has a full spectrum of radiators optimized for different airflow speeds; pick one for low speed. Extremerigs does many reviews and can help you to pick those you're looking for. You can pick a case that is designed to absorb sound frequencies, such as Fractal Design cases (the Define series). You can use a silent profile in the BIOS in order to drive quietly all the fans. Then you can put the PC in a distant place (eg. under the desk). Just remember that the noise energy decrease in a law of d^-3 (where d is distance) in an open space, d^-2 if it's between 2 boards/walls, d^-1 if it's in a tube. Hence space design,  placement and room matters too.
I'm not really familiar with why this is and what specifically is lacking, but in the official spec sheet, this is a difference between the two.  The UX430UQ lists: 1 x Type-Câ„¢ USB 3.1 Gen 1 with support for external display While the UX433FN lists: 1 x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-Câ„¢ (up to 10Gbps)  An external USB Graphics Card (something like this) is certainly a solution that can work, but it may be a bit tricky with Linux support if supported at all.
ASUS does not provide display support on the USB-C connector for the UX433 (nor for the UX333). Display support is present for the equivalent 15" model UX533.  The only clue is a small difference in the technical specs.  https://www.asus.com/us/Laptops/ASUS-Zenbook-14-UX433FN/Tech-Specs/  doesn't mention the display:  Interfaces    1 x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-Câ„¢ (up to 10Gbps)   whereas this page: https://www.asus.com/us/Laptops/ASUS-Zenbook-15-UX533FD/Tech-Specs/  clearly states that it is supported:  Interfaces    1 x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-Câ„¢ (up to 10Gbps) **with display support**   Thanks to Yisroel Tech for the original answer.

Dell Latitude, series 7490 is obtainable with 32GB RAM (I have one sitting on my table).  The keyboard layout is sadly far from ThinkPads (answer to all three points regarding the keyboard is a "No"). Looks decently.  Have you looked into Thinkpad X62 and T70?
I managed to fit most of your requirements with laptops ready to ship today in the US. Both laptops have Bluetooth 4.1, 802.11ac LAN cards, but are 15.6" laptops. Laptops with larger/smaller screens compromised price and/or specs.  I recall Netbeans sometimes being RAM usage heavy. Between the IDE, the OS, and any Browsers with documentation open, I think 8 GB would be a safer margin to prevent having to page to memory.  I also went around your HDD requirements and opted to recommend you laptops with 256 GB SSDs. This is because at this low end price range laptop manufacturers like to cut corners by giving you dirt cheap drives that will become irritating bottlenecks when trying to use your laptop (e.g. waiting 45 seconds for your browser to launch while your cpu only uses less than a quarter of it's processing power). The processors in these laptops are designed with lower TDP and have no discrete graphics cards, therby increasing battery life.  Lenovo Laptop IdeaPad 330 $424.99 + $2.99 Shipping    The AMD Ryzen in this laptop is effectively slower than the i7-6700HQ you can get in mid-higher end laptops during 2015/2016 by 10% according to avg benchmarks.

I believe the Linux kernel supports AMD64 (X86-64) architecture. You should be able to install Kubuntu over the existing Operating System with a boot key (usb). Pretty much all commercially available hardware is supported by Ubuntu, I'd be surprised if your average consumer laptop would cause Kubuntu to reject the installation.
The majority of PC noise is cooling related...   The less heat you generate, the less noise generated Conversely, you can cool it less, making it run hotter, albeit if you go too far, you can reduce the lifespan of some components Or you can cool better; expel heat more efficiently, so less effort required and less noise produced Or you can directly try to tackle/block the noise   In addition to Soleil's good suggestions...   If your BIOS does not have a silent/quite profiles or PWM fans, you can use inline resistors between mobo and fan cable to reduce voltage to 7v, which in turn will reduce speed and thus noise.  (Approach #2) You can add insulating materials to the case, usually foam or fibre pads that absorb/dissipate some noise. (#4) You can buy a larger case, or de-clutter the inside of the case (e.g. careful, neat cable routing) to reduce airflow obstructions. (#3) On similar lines, a common airflow approach is a low, front-facing intake fan to an upper rear exhaust fan. Whatever your approach, try to encourage a single airflow route from a cool intake fan, across all key components, to that upper exhaust fan. (#3) Consider having more/larger fans but have them running slower (i.e. via resistors, above) - more airflow overall (#3) Get a case with the PSU in a sealed compartment at the bottom of the case. Old-school cases used the PSU at the top as an exhaust fan of sort, so hot case air would enter the PSU, where it is heated further, and heavily loads the smaller, lower flow PSU fan - avoid this. Use a premium, aftermarket thermal paste, rather that the standard stuff that comes with your cooler, and make sure you apply it correctly (#3) For mechanical noise, an easy win is to buy silicon grommets and/or plastic screws to reduce the noise from HDD vibration passing through to the case. (#4) Also you can buy rubber/silicon gaskets to place between fans and the case to acheive the same ends. (#4)

You can buy any quality 600 watt powersupply and up for your system. Usually anything above $40 with 80 Gold efficiency and up is considered good, make sure to look up the reviews for the power supply. You shouldn't need to spend more than $100.   Here are some options -    EVGA SuperNova 650 G3 (~$70) EVGA SuperNova 650 G1+ (~$70)  Corsair TX-M TX650M (~$70)  Seasonic Focus SSR-750FM (~$75)   In regards to the non standard connection the only one I see is the 14 pin power connector on your motherboard. This can be solved by buying a 20/24 pin adapter to 14 pin adapter on amazon for lenovo/IBM machines.
Great answer by tanius.  I would also add that DECT phones are better suited to voice communications as DECT is a stream / connection based rather than packet based protocols built on top of WiFi.  This allows for tighter control of the quality of service, codecs, power consumption etc.  Mentioned FritzBox offers many access points  / routers with DECT stack built in.
The ports pictured are: Left (almost out of picture) - HDMI Middle - DVI Right - VGA  Your laptop has HDMI and VGA ports.  Cables usually have the same type of connector on both ends,  but you can get different ones, and there are adapters the can change the connector at one end. So you could use quite a wide variety of cables.  However, the simplest, best quality and most future-proof option would be a standard HDMI cable.
Acer Predator Helios 300 | $814 + $9.99 Shipping       I know I'm probably asking for a lot so if I am give me some advice to tone it down efficiently or how much it would realistically cost.   Actually, $1000 is a pretty generous budget considering your user case. Since you want to have multiple adobe products up at once and running smoothly, I've decided to recommend you a discrete graphics card, 16 GB of RAM and an SSD. The discrete will be able to handle visually intensive processing, the RAM multiple applications, and the SSD will cut down on application startup time.  In terms of sturdiness, the laptop is constructed primary with brushed aluminum rather than completely in plastic so it will be quite a bit more robust for people with an active lifestyle.     All in all, the Helios 300 is a well-built 15-inch gaming laptop that   isnâ€™t too heavy and big to carry around, has decent input devices and   appears to be pretty sturdy with good choice of materials. We   definitely recommend it in this price range if the above-mentioned   properties are of great importance to you.      - laptopmedia.com    i7-7700HQ Nvidia GTX 1060 6 GB 16 GB DDR4 256 GB SSD Actual Dimensions (W x D x H) 15.40" x 10.50" x 1.05" Screen Dimensions 15.6" (Diagonal) (W x H) 13.6 x 7.6" 5.95 lbs.

Well let me be the one to answer my own question. I found a working adapter!  This adapter https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/2-in-1-Snelle-Lading-Headset-Adapter-Type-C-USB-C-3-5mm-Digitale-Audio-Kabel/32961645430.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.4b6a4c4d82wJiw [1] from AliExpress is advertised as a USB C splitter just like the ones on Amazon, but on the contrary it never mentions having a DAC like the ones on Amazon. What it does mention is working with the Pixel phones and I can confirm that! Not only does it work for the Google 3.5mm dongle, but it also works for a mouse and USB flash drive I tried.  I'm sure there are some on Amazon working the same way (as they often re-sell Chinese stock) but I haven't tried any of those as they were more expensive.  I also haven't tried it on other devices like a Chromebook but I assume it works the same for all USB 3.1 devices (like the pixel 2xl). Whether USB alternative mode is supported for displays I cannot test currently.  Edit: I just tried the adapter with a Oneplus 6T (USB 2.0 with analog audio over USB) and it only works one port at a time. And analog audio doesn't work. This is quite expected because of the broken and old spec Oneplus uses and the lack of audio over usb c wires in the adapter.

I'm passed the video gaming phase so gaming laptops might not be the   best option for me.   On the contrary, I've found gaming laptops too have good value when aiming for higher ends specs. In addition, mechanical and/or backlit keyboards are harder to find in non-gaming series machines as the average consumer does not care about backlit mechanical keyboards.  It seems there are not many laptop manufacturers that explicitly make mechanical keyboard laptops. You'll also notice that these laptops have discrete graphics cards. At this price/spec range this is pretty much par for the course. These just happened to be the cheapest laptops I could find matching your specs.

With your normal user case you probably will get a decent battery life.    For a more price efficient solution leaving off mechanical keyboards:  I happen to also do Full Stack Development for my University's traffic safety research lab and daily use a MSI GS-60 6QE, which has the same steel series keyboard in this laptop. Since this is a gaming laptop the keyboard comes equipped with anti-ghosting measures. Having typed somewhere in the ballpark of a couple hundred thousand lines of code on this laptop I can tell you it has an exceedingly decent typing experience as far as membrane keyboards go.

Personally I would just get this laptop and then buy a really nice mechanical keyboard, but that might end up in contravention to the whole portability factor of having a laptop in the first place.
I hope I understood correctly: You're asking for a computer connected scales that can weigh tube-like items about 1.2 m long and ~20 kg in weight, and that does not cost a fortune.  A so-called "smart" bathroom scales would meet these requirements, when applying the following modifications:   Choose scales with a known interface. Smart bathroom scales have a Bluetooth 4.0 and / or wifi connection. Since you want to connect it to your internal software application and don't want to make that dependent on any cloud hosted "solution" by the scales' manufacturer, you would choose one where the protocol has already been reverse engineered and some code is available for the Bluetooth communications.  For that, have a look at the supported scales in openScale and the code to support them. These are all Bluetooth scales, so you'll need a Bluetooth 4.0 endpoint in your network, for example a Raspberry Pi 3. (Anything that only supports Bluetooth 3.0 is not compatible.)  It would be nicer to use a wifi scale, to avoid the Bluetooth device in your network and the need for developing the Bluetooth communications software. However, hacking the wifi scale to connect to your own server rather than the manufacturer's server involves bending the DNS (example for the Nokia / Withings Body), which you could consider an ugly hack that you don't want. Enlarge the scales' platform. A typical smart scales consists of four load cells and an electronics board, all connected with wires (example). I think that there will be no change in the scales' function or accuracy when you extend these wires and then mount the load cells and electronics into a larger, 1.2 m long platform that you build yourself. (However, since I did not try this yet, you'll have to try first â€¦)
To avoid a lack of updates for software bugs, let's require that the scales model is either (1) currently in production, (2) supported by a manufacturer's software for their whole range of models or (3) supported by a third-party, open source software that is ideally in current development.  Within these requirements, I found:   Beurer diagnostic bathroom scales with the orange "beurer connect" logo (14 models). These all work with the Beurer Health Manager app (Android / iOS), for which "the full range of functions can be used locally without registering" (source). In addition, the Beurer BF700 / 710 / 800 models are supported by openScale, an open source app for smart scales.  At least in 2014, these were the only off-the-shelf bathroom scales that do not require cloud storage (source), and so far I am not aware that this changed for the better. openScale supported scales. This includes the Beurer BF700 / 710 / 800 models from above, 23 other commercial models, and a generic hack to transform any scales with LCD into a supported smart scales. Withings Body, previously Nokia Body. This is a wifi connected scale talking unencrypted JSON, at least in the original model from 2010 to at least 2013. This hopefully still applies (but I can't yet confirm), and hopefully also applies to the Withings Body+ and Cardio models.  There are instructions here and here (including small applications) to modify it so it talks to your own server rather than the manufacturer's servers in the cloud. That own server could be for example a Raspberry Pi in your local home network, making the scales independent of an Internet connection.  While the wifi connection is easier to work with than Bluetooth when developing your own software, the solution involves DNS bending which is a "dirty hack" that you might not like.
I went for an Acer Predator Helios 500 with an AMD Ryzen 2700 8 core processor, 512GB SSD and 1TB normal hard drive. The processor is socketed, so could theoretically be upgraded later.  It can be upgraded to 4x16GB RAM if the 2 factory fitted 8GB RAM modules are replaced, as they are single rank, but 16GB modules appear to be double rank and they are not compatible.  (If you do this, note that the first two slots are not user-accessible.)  For anybody interested, the cost was â‚¬1927 plus ~â‚¬285 for extra RAM plus â‚¬20 to switch the modules. Hopefully I can sell the old RAM modules for â‚¬80 or more. So approx. â‚¬2150 with 32GB of RAM - I now just need to get another SODIMM or two.
The option A (Formula) is more interesting (and less expensive) since we got:   the 5Gbit LAN (~90 EUR for a NIC) the mosfet watercooling (~50-100 EUR for the waterblocks) both for about 100 EUR instead of 140-190 EUR. more 4 PCIE lanes, available for instance for another NVMe   Switching to Skylake-X is interesting when:   latency+speed host-device is important (eg., inference service) when there is more than 3 discrete GPUs when more than 64GB (128GB since z390) is needed when bandwidth is critical (in memory bound compute tasks) when there is a need of AVX512 (eg. computer vision), which has the advantage to provide low latency SIMD with floats.   Intel platform is more interesting than AMD's due to the HPC support and ecosystem (both hardware and software).
For DL, everything happens in the GPU; the most important factors are amount of memory (the more the total GPU memory the more complex your models and better the results) and bandwidth.  Subsequently I would drop definitely (5), and go for (3).
Take a look at this:  Foldable Keyboard, Jelly Comb B003S 3-in-1 (USB/Microusb/Type C) Wired & BT Keyboard with Touchpad Compatible for All Devices Windows PC iOS Android Tablet-Black  Seems to match everything (but does include Bluetooth as well.)

As a general rule, I'd recommend having a GPU of the same calibre and age as your CPU. And given your needs, this may well suit you.  I'm not an expert in all this graphical stuff, but AFAIK most modellers (inc SketchUp) tend to need to do linear calculations and thus are usually restricted to a single core, so the speed of an individual core is key - so get a good CPU.  Whereas renderers like VRay usually use CUDA on the GPU, so perhaps you should prioritise your GPU? VRay and some other renderers can supplement/help their GPU using the CPU, so spare CPU cores may be useful.  So in short, get the best CPU & GPU there is!   A bit impractical if you are budget-limited? Of course, so have 3 options:   Prioritise Modelling (CPU) Prioritise Rendering (GPU) Or hedge your bets with a balanced config - comparable CPU & GPU.   So which do you do most of?  Back to your sample configs, it is worth noting that the performance gap between the i7 6700HQ and the 8750H is approx 40% (based on user benchmarks). The gap between the 1050 and the 180 however is about 250%. If you want to adopt my balanced recommendation, you'd pair the 6700HQ with a GTX1060 or better.
Specifically answering for Nvidia GPUs:  A GTX 1070ti will have no problem at all running 3 2560x1440 monitors and 1 4K for video and desktop computing as long as you are using the correct display outputs and monitors that support HDMI 2.0, DVI-D, or Displayport.  You should theoretically be able to run 4 4K screens off of any 10XX, or 20XX series card, or a higher end 9XX series as these nvidia architectures all support 4 displays.  For the rest of the hardware:  CPU and RAM usage typically goes up as you have more applications open to fill the 4 screens, this will vary greatly depending on what those applications are though. If you update your question with specifically what applications you are using, then I can give a recommendation suited to your workload. Otherwise, any quad core CPU from the recent AMD or Intel series and at least 8GB of RAM will likely be sufficient.  Edit: One more thing that I should mention is regarding 4K video playback. It is possible that some applications or browsers could ignore the video decoding features of your GPU and work the CPU very hard to decode the 4K video. In those cases it's best to have as fast of a CPU as possible. This is likely only going to show up with outdated applications or drivers.
Answering my own question (it was solved by Bennett Yeo in the comments to my question)  First I tried the iiyama ProLite XUB2395WSU-B1 as I was happy with iiyama before. I didn't keep it for long as:     the reported max height of 385mm is actually 410mm   1920x1200 is too many pixels to fit into a 22"/22.5" screen While it is possible to adjust the font sizes of Operating System display fonts, with such a small pixel size (unless you have the eyes of a hawk) you might well need add-ons/extensions for your browser(s) to increase the font size of every web page.     Then I tried the Dell U2412M as suggested by Bennett Yeo in the comments to my question.    The first one I purchased had a strong colour cast across the screen: pink/yellow on the left ranging to green/blue on the right. I sent it back and ordered one from another source. And this one I've kept.    White isn't perfectly white, as suggested in some other reviews. But, colours are consistent over the screen and, if I'd had the iiyama, I would probably have activated the 'reduced blue' mode and ended up with exactly the same result.   24" diagonal is right for a 1920x1200 screen: I increased the OS display fonts by 1pt; web pages are comfortable to read without adjustment.    The on/standby light is integral with the on/off button and is a completely unobtrusive gentle orange/blue.   The system for adjusting screen settings is the best I've ever seen. Four blank mechanical buttons on the right (above the on/off). Pressing any button activates the menu. Each option in the menu is adjacent to the button which activates it. Brilliant.   I have the screen on 'text mode', with brightness adjusted down (20) and contrast adjusted up (80). And for me that gives a very comfortable display.    The extra screen 'real-estate' -- 1920x1200 in 24" vs 1650x1080 in 22" -- is a pleasure, as I get more vertical text space for viewing/editing code, and more space overall for editing graphics.    At its lowest, the top edge of the screen is 410mm above the desk, and the bezel adds another 20mm. I would prefer it lower and, if I purchase another stand to achieve this, I shall post an update to this answer. NB, if you're thinking of doing the same, the stand attachment area is recessed into the back of the monitor by about 6mm. Which does make attaching/detaching the original stand very easy, but does mean that the Wearson WS-03A Adjustable LCD Monitor Stand that I was thinking of using won't work on its own as it has a 'lip' at the bottom of the attachment plate. It is possible to purchase spacer kits, or simply another stand which fits inside the recess. And remember to check the size of monitor it will hold, quite a few are only only recommended for up to 22".    So I'm currently looking at Wearson WS-03A Adjustable LCD Monitor Stand plus Part KingÂ® Vesa Bolt / Screw / Washer / Spacer Kit or Wearson WS-03UP VESA Monitor Stand on its own. or...
I am not sure if you will get all the listed requirements, usually if you want something cheap you will sacrifice elsewhere.  That being said, you should look at 'MDisc' as a backup medium, also 'magnetic tapes' would also be worth looking into as an alternative.  TechTarget.com - did a write-up on some of the options for cold storage backups - Demand for cold data storage heats up   This image from the article provided a good comparison between some of the different options.
After some reconsideration, prompted by the responses above, I went with 64GiB with no space to upgrade, which really does seem more than enough, even in long term. (It's not "for bragging"... I simply hate it when system starts swapping and I want to postpone the next hardware upgrade as much as possible :-))  I also discovered System Builder, a site that many of you are likely familiar with, which greatly simplified choosing of components, as my greatest problem was "will the components that I pick work together?".  I ended up taking these, plus some no-name tower when I realised that my previous one has a built-in back mask (for motherboard's plugs) which suits only my previous motherboard. I never saw that before and didn't think to check before starting the assembly.  A big thanks to @CDove for the helpful reply, and to others who gave useful comments.  P.S. It seems wrong to accept my own answer, especially when there is a helpful one above, yet it is this one that describes what I went with in the end. What is customary on this site in these cases?
In terms of image processing it's really complicated. Depends on the software too.  If the software can utilize multi cores, then choose the high core count. If not, choose the cpu with higher freq
Despite that the majority of models these days have an integrated battery , there still are smartphones that can have their battery easily removed, like Samsung Galaxy J4  One easy way to discover some phones (but not all) is to use a site which has parametric search like Kimovil.

So, here is my "happy end" story. I could not find more good options  so I was a bit on the fence about what to buy ... and know what? Recently I was in the local computer store and what did I see! There is a keyboard sold which is exactly what I need. It is A4Tech X7 G800V model, a budget (~30$ in Russia) keyboard with extra buttons below the space bar.    Now I am really puzzled why google was so inefficient on this when I ve been  searching for "keyboard with extra buttons", "extra key row" etc. and what not - nothing valuable popped up. And almost by accidence I have noticed this keyboard in the local computer store.  I have bought it and have been testing it for a week, and I am very pleased, so I've  even decided to write about my experience so far. Here is a link to the product:  http://x7.a4tech.com/product.aspx?id=87    image:     Note: there is another very similar keyboard, G800MU, but it is not suitable for the described needs, because it has no possibility to reprogramm the extra keys, whereas the G800V has this possibility, so be cautious when buying.    So what I get:    Fully reprogrammable extra keys - 15 keys total (gray keys marked with G and a number).  There is a software "X7 Oscar Keyboard Editor" in the downloads and its very easy to use - no reboot  required to reprogramm the keys. So you can reprogramm any G-key to any key, mouse button, or even some macros and more. And that is really cool. Absolute no problems or glitches with that so far.  Overall very good build quality and materials (despite first impression mainly because of childish red WASD keys). It is a membrane keyboard, but feels really good and smooth - low resistance force and short travel reminds me of  some 90's Chicony keyboard feel.  Now to the best feature - extra keys below the spacebar is what I needed so much: now I have both mouse buttons  on my keyboard in a comfortable position under my thumb and don't need any software tweaks and manipulations.  Working on a graphic tablet finally became comfortable (thanks heaven and a4tech). So I just disable the "click on tip touch" feature in the graphic tablet driver and bind the G-7 key as left mouse button.   Very nice bonus - an extra key (G-11) near the ESC key - for now I have bound it to 0 key so I can type numbers like 10, 20, 30, 01, etc. with left hand easily.     Few minor issues that I have noticed:     Strange decision from a4tech to place the left Alt key below the Z key and to put G12 extra key on its place - this is IMO mistake, BUT - you can easily reprogramm this G12 key  to Alt and the problem is solved, that's what I did, so in  the end my Alt is even better placed than on many modern keyboards. The G1-G4 keys (oval keys on the left side) are really hard to press, no idea why they made it so. Definitely those could be more useful if they worked with less force. There is no replacement keycaps for those red silicone keycaps (not a real issue though). The legs are a bit small, I'd want to raise the angle more -- needed to put some 10 mm blocks under the legs  to raise the angle more, but that is individual preference I think.  Happy end :-)
I noticed in your profile you've marked your location as Germany. This is going to make things a little harder.    MSI GL63 8RC-076 | â‚¬829,42 (VAT-Inclusive) + â‚¬18,91 International Shipping    This is the best Laptop I can fit under your price constraint.

I currently use a i7-6700K with Visual Studio, C#, and Resharper smoothly, all of which are orders of magnitude heavier than your Java setup. I also like to compile executable's to my RAM disk and still don't max out my CPU.  Disk Space  You'll have a 128 GB NVMe SSD, and a 1 TB hard drive. If you're only using this for office work you probably won't have too many games on it, so you should be good on that front. As an MSI owener I can tell you the hard drives are pretty decent, at least faster than the HDD that are shipped with U series Intel processors that grind laptops to a halt.  If you completely fill your SSD and find your HDD to be a bottleneck, you can turn on NTFS compression to try and shift more of the load onto your CPU and RAM. Just make sure you format as NTFS right away, as I've found windows laptop externals to be typically formatted as exFAT.    You may still want to try and search German based online stores for variants of this laptop to match your specs more closely. I hope this can serve as a good starting point if this is the case.
You could try the topre switches, they are not so loud, and from what I've heard it's qiute an experience.  This one for example: Realforce 87U on Amazon  You can check a review here: YouTube Review on Realforce 87U  They are also mechanical but they are less loud than Cherry MX. Myself, I have a Ducky Zero with brown MX but I don't have issues with the clicky noises :)
Chaining worked, but I had to check with the manufacturer for model numbers and to confirm it would work. Their tech team kindly tested it for me, to check that the HDMI EDID adapter would work behind a DP to HDMI adapter, and told me the exact parts they had used to make it work.  The parts I used were from Lindy, and were a 41068 DP1.2 to HDMI 4k 60Hz converter, with a 32113 HDMI 2.0 EDID adapter plugged into it. Initially I got the adapter the wrong way round - be careful if you use these parts, the "male" (plug) end of the HDMI EDID adapter faces the computer, the "female" (socket) end faces the monitor.  Obviously there are probably other people making these; at this time there isn't much choice but that's likely to change.  They're working absolutely fine, rock solid, on both my HD TV and my 4k monitor.

I bring it to school everyday without charger. It has Windows 10 Home. Now I use Ubuntu 18.04 on it for better coding, the only drawback is the fingerprint sensor which doesn't work under it. All other things are fine. It's light and without a dedicated GPU, so you could foucs on office work, LaTex, Java coding (for me it's Python) etc.   Note that the Lg gram 2019 version is on its way (CPU+10% approximately, all with Thunderbolt), but it depends on you. From my perspective the 2018 version is enough. It may save some money to buy the 2018 version when the 2019 version  gets released, though. I'm not sure about that.
After watching videos on Youtube from LinusTechTips, HardwareCanucks and JayzTwoCents, I have concluded that the best GPU for this use case would be the GTX 1070 8GB, as it uses CUDA to encode and transcode footage using the OpenCL API. While the AMD cards do support OpenCL and Vulkan support, it just isn't as optimized as Nvidia's offerings at the same price point, meaning that video encoding and just in general editing will take longer when compared to a 10-series Pascal GPU.  This also boils down to driver optimization and feature support coming from each respective manufacturer. One thing to note is that Linus used the GTX 980 Ti as the high end Nvidia GPU at the time, so the performance of that card is very similar to a 1070, hence my decision. The GTX 980 Ti essentially mopped the floor with AMD's offerings, no matter how small the gain was over team red.   The 1070 also features lower power consumption and better performance when compared to the other 2 AMD cards I talked about in the original post, which is always ideal for any PC, whilst also allowing for some great 1080p gaming, or maybe even 1440p if we are feeling a bit adventurous.
Use a Polar H7 strap which has Bluetooth Smart and use any application you like for your OS. Polar HR straps are well supported. Here is  screenshot of Heart Beat Monitor from Windows 10 Store. It's not even made by Polar.

As Mihail said you could try a topre switch, however these can be a lot more expensive than the traditional mx style mechanical switches ( that's if you regard topre as mechanical).  https://www.massdrop.com/buy/massdrop-alt-mechanical-keyboard  This isn't tenkeyless as it is missing some of the function keys ( the lesser used ones and some of the keys like print screen and end).  If you consider getting this keyboard I would recommend getting one of the halo switches ( both are tactile) as browns are quite naff imo. Here is an article comparing the difference. ( I use halo trues personally). https://www.tomshardware.com/news/input-club-halo-true-halo-clear-mechanical-switches,34443.html  On the other hand the Code Keyboard and the WASD keyboards also have some good tenkeyless boards from memory.
You're not going to find one.  USB and PCIe are two very different technologies supported by the PCH (Platform Controller Hub) in the chipset of your PC/Server.    The I/O portion of the PCH supplies both PCIe and USB interfaces to the system.  However, PCIe being an expansion bus allows you add additional USB controllers to the system; the USB interface doesn't allow you to add PCIe controllers.  You need to us a USB WiFi Adapter compatible with your flavor of Unix.
... compiling hundreds or thousands of small files regularly. I'm trying to figure out which SSDs are fastest at that sort of workload (it's not often any of the files will be over 1Mb).   An Intel Optane 900P Series SSD (for a consumer drive at reasonable prices).  Consider all your options:   Buy more memory. 16 gigabytes / 1 megabyte = 16,000.  If you only have 16 GB (or 8GB) of memory then buying more memory would be a good investment. Reading a file, even from a harddrive, is fairly quick; it's the conversion from text to assembly language and opcodes that takes processing effort, reading the files from memory is very fast.  More memory allows more space to do the operations necessary to compile the source and allows for a larger swap file, staving off the need to fetch from storage.  It also allows more breathing room for your program to execute and to have additional necessary programs running, speaking of which, close unnecessary programs during compilation. Any SSD will be much faster than a harddrive. You can buy an inexpensive and small SSD and be better off than using a harddrive for storage.  A 250 GB SSD will hold your operating system, a couple of games, your compiler toolchain and plenty of source code. You can use your old harddrive as a secondary drive and to backup your SSD.  Exactly which one to choose is mostly a matter of availability and price. A lot of what you are doing when writing the source code will involve very little disk activity. Once you get to the compilation that will involve reading the file, making many calculations as to how to optimize the output, and finally writing out the object file.  If you have lots of existing source code that you want to compile and intend to spend next to no time writing then the need for faster storage becomes a consideration.   It depends on what you will be spending most of your time doing, arguably a CPU upgrade might be a greater benefit than memory.  But let's assume you have gone through the above considerations and crunched the numbers, you want your question answered, as written.   An Intel Optane SSD 900P Series (280GB, AIC PCIe x4, 3D XPoint) for approximately U$250 will provide an enormous speedup; above and beyond other SSDs.    You could:   buy a no-name SSD for ~12% the price of an Optane drive, or ... buy one of the fastest non-Optane drives available (Samsung 970 EVO Plus Series - 1TB PCIe NVMe - M.2 Internal SSD) and get 4x the capacity at the same price. For laptop use the slower HP EX920 will extend your battery life per charge.   AnandTech's conclusion is: the Optane is the fastest and most expensive, the not yet available M.2 version of the SZ985 is untested and an unknown price (expected to be comparable to an Optane and less expensive), the Samsung 970 EVO Plus Series will either save you money or gain you 4x the capacity for equal money, and the least expensive HP EX920 isn't far behind (or poor quality) and will save you U$100.
The "routers" that are available via the retail channel are not suitable for high demand type applications.  Additionally, you said that you already had a "router" that acted as a DHCP server so there's no point in getting another one.  All your need is a wireless access point or WAP.    I use the Ubiquiti UniFi AC Pro, not only for my clients, but in my home as well.  It's one of the best and most reliable WAPs I have used and is priced at around $150 which is comparable to a high end "retail router."    Key Features   POE (Power Over Ethernet) Enhanced MIMO (Multi Input, Multi Output) technologies Up to 200 client connections 2.4GH and 5GHz radios Multiple SSID support VLAN support Bandwidth profiles Guest networks and hotspot support   You can get more information as well as a full full datasheet from their website.  Solution   Disable the WiFi on your existing retail router Run a network cable from your router to the location(s) where you want the APs.  These are designed to be ceiling or wall mounted.  With wireless, the clearer the line of sight the better (this is why table top "routers" are sketchy at best). Using the included software, configure the AP with your SSID, encryption keys, VLAN's etc.   Note that without doing a site survey, it's possible you may need more than one AP given what obstructions (i.e. walls, large furniture, RF generating equipment, etc. - WiFi is still subject to the laws of physics).  Clients will associate with the WAP and get their IP from the existing "router" with DHCP server because in essence all you're doing is "upgrading" the cheap WiFi chipset and radio bundled with your router for an "industrial strength" one.  Personal note... I had this exact WAP support about a dozen guests (including children)  at my home with most streaming Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, etc. and they outstripped my Internet bandwidth before this AP got bogged down (the software comes with reporting capabilities).
I am very satisfied with these "NC-25" headphones https://www.amazon.com/Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Wireless-Srhythm/dp/B0797NS5WB They are both Bluetooth or wired (with detachable cable), easy to use, foldable, over-ear, have noise-canceling, come with a classy compact sturdy case, cost 59.99$     I wear them most of the time when working, without music, only for the quietness of noise-canceling. I also found that they help a lot to get some rest during long distance travel, etc
Let me introduce you to the legendary Datahand keyboard.        It is said to be the most wrist-friendly as you are only supposed to move slightly fingers when using it. You can configure it in the most comfortable position for you.        Unfortunately, its production has been discontinued, it is hard to find.
Unfortunately, all options are rather bad. I think option 3 is somewhat acceptable given the circumstances. I would recommend expanding your search.   The ram of your GPU is also important. The 1050 has only 2GB, which is not enough. You'll need more, otherwise you cannot train most models.  Can you buy a GPU and install it in a available computer in your institute (this is rather easy and could save a lot of money)?     For more details, here is a deep learning hardware guide.
MSI GL63 8SE-054 | Rp26,352,888 + Rp594,142 Shipping    This machine is more than capable of playing the most computationally intensive of triple AAA titles at stable fps with features specifically tuned to gaming (anti-ghosting keyboard) and ready to ship to Indonesia today.   RTX 2060 6 GB i7-8750H 16 GB Memory 1 TB HDD 128 GB NVMe SSD FHD @ 120 Hz
For the consumer side I would recommend a Noctua industrial series fan. I can't say much about the enterprise products as I am not familiar with them.
The LG Gram 2018 (13.3 or 14 inches) should be what you are looking for.  The 2018 lineup has one soldered memory slot and one socketed memory slot which is replaceable.  For example the LG Gram 13Z980 model.  This is the Crucial compatible upgrades page for it: https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/compatible-upgrade-for/LG-Electronics/lg-gram-13z980
The Detroit DIY Electronics Wifi-5370-Antenna might be an option: http://detroit-electronics.com/Wifi_Adapter_Dongle_For_Raspberry_Pi/wifi-for-raspberry-pi-antenna     Chipset: RT5370      Great for ethical hacking projects (this model supports packet injection).
A quick search for FIOS-G1100 power adaptor suggests its a KSAS0361200300HU made by ktech power. There's an amazon link here. Its designed for that model - I can't quite tell what the barrel size is and you can tell the barrel polarity from the amazon image as being center positive, if you wanted to get an equivilent replacement
